Which helps explain why the city has come to be known as the epicenter of the worldwide LGBTQ community . Here are some of reasons why San Francisco became the world 's gay mecca : Castro Neighborhood Take a walk through history in one of the original U.S. LGBTQ neighborhoods and make your way right to the LGBTQ center of San Francisco . Every store , restaurant , bar and nightclub in this district welcomes you with open arms , with none of the stress you typically have when you 're trying to figure out if a business is LGBTQ-friendly in other cities . Make some time to explore the GLBT History Museum and learn more about the struggles of the past , then party the night away at the QBar . Find a hotel in the Castro neighborhood . 1974 : Castro Street Fair Another highlight of the Castro District is the Castro Street Fair , held every month in October . This street celebration dates back to 1974 , when founder Harvey Milk brought artists , vendors and artisans together in this community fair . Today , you can buy handmade goods directly from LGBTQ makers , find your way to the dance floors , or enjoy the music coming from multiple stages . 2017 : Rainbow Honor Walk Forget the Hollywood Walk of Fame . You need to check out the Rainbow Honor Walk that recognizes prominent LGBTQ individuals who made a long-lasting impact throughout their lives . Swing by the intersection of Castro St. and Market St. to find these plaques . As you walk along the blocks in this area , you will learn about many people who excelled in their fields , performed the activist work needed to make the LGBTQ community what it is today , and contributed their hearts and souls to this cause . Military 1942 : WWII Stronghold San Francisco became a military stronghold during WWII , establishing bases like Fort Funston and Fort Mason . It was a symbol of freedom for 1,650,000 men , as it was the last part of the country that they glimpsed before they saw combat on foreign lands , and the first thing that they saw when they returned . Thousands of young male enlistees descended on city looking for love , sometimes with each other , sometimes with locals who were their fans . 2016 : Demilitarized Fleet Week Today , the military has markedly little presence and most of the bases have turned into tourist attractions , housing developments , or local hangouts . The annual Fleet Week , when military guys and , increasingly , gals , descend on the city , is a highly celebrated occasion for the LGBTQ community where sexy men in uniform can be spotted in every corner of the city from the Marina to the Castro letting freedom reign in the post-Don ' t Ask , Do n't tell world . PRIDE 1970 : First Pride March Thirty courageous people risked it all to march down Polk Street to City Hall in a time when any association with homosexuality risked discrimination and worse . The following day a `` gay-in '' took place in Golden Gate Park drawing hundreds more . Combined , these mark the genesis of the Gay Freedom Day Parade . Today , Polk Street is home to a wide range of LGBTQ-friendly restaurants , bars , nightclubs and Disco Diva clubs , such as the Cinch and the Lush Lounge . Of course , you do n't have to wander through Polk Street and the surrounding areas at night to have a good time . During the day , you see unique boutiques , plenty of antiques and restaurants that cater to every taste . Most of the businesses in this area are small and locally owned , so you get a true sense of San Francisco 's local flavor -LRB- sometimes literally , if you head to a cafe or bakery -RRB- . 2018 : 48th Annual Pride Nearly 2 million people will descend on San Francisco from every corner of the world . This is the largest gathering of LGBTQ people in the nation and takes place over 10 action-packed days . The day before Pride , Pink Saturday , is one of the the biggest public parties of the year . Pride is now enjoyed by millions worldwide -- gay , lesbian , straight and everything in between . Plan your SF trip for the last weekend in June and take part in the biggest Pride event in the U.S. You 've got the high-energy parade and truly creative floats , tons of performers and a celebration that spans the entire weekend . There 's nothing quite like taking part in Pride with tens of thousands of people joyously celebrating who they are in the most accepting city around . These are the best areas to stay for San Francisco Pride . Politics 1977 : Harvey Milk Harvey Milk is elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors , becoming the first openly gay elected official in California history , only to be gunned down , along with beloved pro-gay Mayor George Moscone , by fellow supervisor Dan White , on Nov. 27 , 1978 . 2016 : Harvey Milk Democratic Club Openly gay Assemblyman Mark Leno serves his 14th year . San Francisco is full of openly gay city , county , and state officials including Board of Supervisor David Campos , and former Board of Supervisor , now current California State Assemblyman , Scott Wiener . Two of the city 's most prominent political clubs include LGBT-centric Harvey Milk and Alice B. Toklas . It is impossible to get elected to citywide office without LGBTQ support . Changing The World For the Better 1964 : Gay Capital of America San Francisco is touted as the `` Gay Capital of America '' in `` Life '' magazine . Activists of all stripes flock to San Francisco to start the fight we know today as the gay rights movement , and to take it first to the rest of America and then the world . 2016 : Marriage Mecca of the US After a series of victories and defeats for California 's Proposition 8 , the U.S. Supreme Court makes same-sex marriage legal across the United States , invalidating every last ban . San Francisco first issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples in 2004 and was recently voted LGBTQ `` Marriage Mecca '' by GayCities members . 2017 : Gay Men 's Chorus ' Lavender Pen Tour When the new Trump Administration began rolling back LGBTQ protections and rights , San Franciscans immediately took action with demonstrations for equal rights . While many took to the streets of San Francisco in peaceful protest , others , such as the San Francisco Gay Men 's Chorus decided to fight hate by taking their message of love to several red states this October . The Lavender Pen Tour is an attempt to support and encourage LGBTQ + people and their allies by promoting acceptance and love through music . Drag 1933 : Female Impersonation Finocchio 's was a nightclub and bar in the sexually liberal San Francisco Barbary Coast . In 1933 , with the repeal of prohibition , the club offered female impersonation shows , the early name for drag queens , that drew enormous crowds that quickly spread across the city like glitter . 2016 : Drag Club Oasis One of San Francisco 's ruling drag queens , Heklina , opens Oasis , a popular drag club . Drag shows take place at more than 20 venues per week including Trannyshack and Sunday 's a Drag . San Francisco is also headquarters to the legendary Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence , the largest charitable drag organization in the country . 2017 : Hunky Jesus Contest Easter can be a trying time of year when you have to go through yet another round of `` poorly formed political opinions '' from extended family . Want a way better way to spend that weekend ? Escape to the Hunky Jesus Contest and see just how sinful -LRB- and hunky ! -RRB- this saintly figure can be . You get to ogle long-haired eye candy walking around shirtless , or you can throw on a loincloth and join in on the contest . The competition is fierce , and you get an Easter celebration that you 're going to want to make into a tradition right away . Into The Night 1908 : First Gay Bar Among the first `` notorious '' gay bars in San Francisco was a dark , secretive place known The Dash , known only to insiders . Waiters cross-dressed and for $ 1 would perform sex acts in private booths . In 1972 , Twin Peaks Tavern opened its door and windows to the public . Gay bars in the Castro now often boast as many non-gay patrons as gay ones , with people of all sorts enjoying the open , nonjudgmental atmosphere . 2016 : Best Gaybourhood In The World Castro and SoMa were named the world 's best Gaybourhoods by GayCities members in 2016 . Any given night , you can find bars packed and clubs hopping with a mix of locals and tourists who come to gay it up in the city . The original gay center was Polk Street and parts of the Tenderloin , both of which still boast gay bars , but transitioned to make the Castro and gayest neighborhoods anywhere , with at least a dozen gay bars within a few blocks of each other on Castro , Market and 18th Street . The South of Market Area is also a new hot spot for LGBTQ bars , clubs and festivals , such as the Folsom Street Fair . Leather & Fetish 1938 : Sailor Boy Tavern The first proto-leather bar in San Francisco was the Sailor Boy Tavern , which opened in 1938 and was primarily for visiting navy men looking for action . In the 1960s , the leather scene established itself in SOMA with bars such as the Toolbox . 2019 : 25th Annual Folsom Street Fair The leather subculture attracts people from near and far , leaving a legacy that has boomed into what is the leather event of all leather events -- Folsom Street Fair . This leather pride event is the largest of its kind , held in September and centering around the BDSM community through 200 vendor booths , tons of live music performances , demo stations and exhibitors . This is truly an only in San Francisco experience that brings in people worldwide . If Folsom only whets your appetite for leather events , Up Your Alley attracts over 10,000 leather men and takes an edgier approach to its fetish explorations . HIV/AIDS 1981 : First cases of GRID Young men in San Francisco were among the first diagnosed with GRID -LRB- the incorrectly named Gay Related Immuno Deficiency -RRB- . HIV would soon afflict millions . It quickly became a worldwide pandemic . 2016 : HIV/AIDS Endemic San Francisco leads the world in cutting-edge treatment , meaning that few die of HIV any more , and in prevention , with the goal of zero new infections by the year 2020 .

John Mueser , 69 , of Tuckahoe , was charged with first-degree possession of child pornography , risk of injury to a minor , fourth-degree sexual assault and voyeurism . Mueser is an educator at Riverdale Country School , an elite private school in the Riverdale section of the Bronx , N.Y. . According to a police statement , Greenwich police began an extensive investigation last October , which involved digital evidence and thousands of digital photographs . An arrest warrant was later obtained by police , and Mueser was picked up in Tuckahoe . Police did not release any details on the case . `` Due to the sensitive nature of this investigation and the age of the victim , no further details will be released at this time , '' Capt. Robert Berry said early Tuesday evening . After waiving extradition , Mueser was transported to Greenwich Police headquarters on Tuesday . Greenwich police cooperated with the Westchester County Safe Streets Task Force on the investigation , Berry said . He praised an investigator in the department Tuesday . `` Detective Michael Rooney displayed a high level of service and compassion for the victim and the victim 's family during this investigation . His dedication to the family sets an exemplary example for others to follow , '' Berry said . On the Riverdale School website , Mueser is listed as the school 's `` Learning Lab Coordinator & Tech Integrator . '' He holds a number of degrees from Columbia University and is an avid marathon runner , according to social media posts and the school 's website . The school 's index says he works in the Lower School at Riverdale . Mueser posted $ 250,000 bond and was released from custody . `` It 's critical to appreciate that John is presumed innocent of all of these charges . This is a man of no criminal history whatsoever , and we will address each of these accusations at the appropriate time in court , '' said his defense attorney , Mark Sherman , who is a Stamford lawyer . In a statement released Tuesday , Riverdale Head of School Dominic A.A. Randolph said : `` I had been notified by the Greenwich Police Department on the morning of October 3 , 2019 , that Mr. Mueser was under investigation . I immediately placed Mr. Mueser on leave and cooperated fully with the investigation . He has remained on leave and away from our campuses while this investigation was underway . `` During Mr. Mueser 's tenure at Riverdale Country School , we have never encountered any issues with his behavior or his work with our students . He had also undergone a number of background checks in recent years that were completely clear . `` As a result of this situation , we retained a security firm , T&M Protection Resources , that queried members of the Lower School community about his behavior and interactions with our students and reviewed his personnel file . Nothing came to light that would have raised concerns regarding his behavior in our community .

Following the outbreak of COVID-19 this spring , they have had to suddenly transition into a long distance relationship , like many other couples at Rice . Sudden changes Riley , a senior at Hanszen College , distinctly remembers the moment when she got the email from Rice , saying that classes were moving online for the rest of the semester . `` I was inside an Urban Outfitters shopping with my mom when I got the email , and I just -LSB- lost -RSB- my mind . I was so sad , '' Riley said . `` And immediately , I was like , ` I do n't know when I 'm going to see Leah again , and I got really , really upset . ''' Riley and Kanihan are seniors , but they had n't decided exactly what they were going to do about their relationship after graduating , other than make plans to visit each other in different parts of the country . `` It also came by surprise . We knew we were both going to be graduating in May and that things would be different , but we did n't think that we 'd be going long distance right now , in March , '' Kanihan said . Sarah Park and Leon Urdahl have also been thrust into a long distance relationship . The couple has been together for over six months , after meeting at Will Rice College . Urdahl , a sophomore at Will Rice , said that this break , brought about by COVID-19 , differs from winter break because there 's no sense of when they 'll get to meet again . `` There 's not like a sense of , that it 'll be over soon , '' Urdahl said . `` Winter break , you had that date in your mind , you 're like , ` Okay , yeah , it 's only going to be two or three more weeks . ''' Ingrid He and Isaiah Hwang have been dating since fall 2019 . He , who is currently living on campus , is an international student from Beijing , China , while Hwang is from Dallas . Hwang , a freshman at Wiess College , is currently quarantined at home , according to He . `` No one is here , so I 'm -LSB- kind of -RSB- lonely . If we eat together , we do FaceTime to share our food , '' He said . He , a McMurtry College freshman , said coordinating plans such as lunch dates works out because they 're currently in the same time zone , but when she eventually returns to China , they will have to deal with a major time difference for three months . `` I -LSB- will -RSB- get quarantined for 14 days in an area without very good WiFi connection , '' He said . `` I probably could n't contact -LSB- Hwang -RSB- for the next three months , from May to August . So before May I 'm trying to do as many FaceTime calls as possible . '' Jacob Engel and Sachi Paul were in the same Orientation Week group at McMurtry College when they were freshmen and have been dating since December of last year . Paul graduated in December and has been living in an apartment near Rice since then . `` We basically were not doing -LSB- long -RSB- distance until Jacob had to move back for quarantine , '' Paul said . `` Now with all the illness stuff , we do n't know when we 're going to see each other again , so that 's definitely been harder . '' Virtual dates To make up for not seeing each other in person , Engel said that he and Paul have been texting each other a lot . `` Not seeing each other is obviously not ideal , but we still stay in very close contact , '' Engel said . `` We 're just sort of sitting at home , so we have nothing better to do than talk to each other anyways . '' Kanihan , who is a senior at Martel College , said that she and Riley have always placed less emphasis on dates , and more on spending time with each other . Now , they 're trying to bring that mindset towards long distance by texting each other about their plans for the day or asking how the weekend was . `` We were very much conscientious about being in each other 's lives , hanging out and spending time with one another , even if that happened to be on campus or with each other 's friends , '' said Kanihan . Riley said that they like to joke that they were in a long-distance relationship over the summer too , even though they were n't officially dating yet , so this is n't anything new for them . `` Now , we text pretty regularly , we call two to three times a week . We stay in really , really good touch , and it 's been a lot easier than I thought it was going to be , '' Riley said . `` Not because it 's less hard but because it just feels not as lonely as I 'd expected , because she 's always -LSB- kind of -RSB- there . '' According to Paul , she and Engel had both decided that they wanted to do long distance after graduating . `` We may not be in the same place for a number of years . We 're not really sure , '' Paul said . `` We 're both feeling pretty confident that our relationship is pretty strong and hopefully distance will be fine . '' In the meantime , they 've been finding new ways to keep in touch by watching the TV show `` Insecure '' over screen-share . Hwang and He have also been binging TV shows together -- zombie shows , primarily . Sharing the same religion , the couple also finds time to share their thoughts on and read the Bible together . They 've also continued studying together , the way they used to on campus . `` We study accounting together -- oh my god , that class is so excruciating -- he 's my study partner , '' He said . Same city , new lifestyle Connor Rothschild and Catie Choi have been dating for over nine months . Although the couple has not had to go long distance , social isolation has put their relationship to the test , according to Rothschild . Both of them are now living in their respective off-campus apartments in Houston . `` -LSB- Due to COVID-19 -RSB- , you either were forced to experience distance with no preparation for the foreseeable future , or depending on proximity and living situations , you -LSB- essentially -RSB- live with your partner for the foreseeable future now , '' Rothschild , a Martel junior , said . `` We 've definitely been like spending so much more time together , and it 's been like a test , but I think it 's a good test that we 've both been passing . '' Choi , who is a senior at Hanszen , said they 've been having to get really creative with date ideas . `` We 've done stuff we 've never really done before , '' Choi said . `` We went on a picnic yesterday at Hermann Park . '' Rothschild said that spending this much time together is not something that anybody is prepared for , especially with so few options to do things . `` Just talking walks , which seems like something which you 'd do with your married partner of 30 years , you know , like ` Oh let 's go on a date , let 's walk around the neighborhood , ''' Rothschild said . `` But no , it 's like we 're doing that right now , after nine months of dating . '' Although the pandemic has thrown their relationship into an unprecedented situation , Choi was never really worried . `` No matter what happens , we 're both very serious about our relationship so we would 've just done whatever to make it work , '' she said .", "url": "https://www.ricethresher.org/article/2020/04/miles-apart-rice-couples-thrown-into-ldrs", "kws": ["couples", "long^^distance", "dating", "relationships", "Rice", "Alyson^^Riley", "Leah^^Kanihan", "things", "lunch^^dates", "summer^^break", "living^^situations", "freshmen", "winter^^break", "home", "Hanszen^^College", "Alyson", "social^^isolation", "McMurtry^^College", "Wiess^^College", "fall"], "text_category": {}}

The bears , named Ying Ying and Le Le , are middle-aged residents at the city state 's Ocean Park attraction . The couple have been at the zoo since 2007 , but before now have shown no intention of trying to mate . Pictures released by the park this week showed them mating in a quiet corner of their enclosure . They had earlier been spotted embracing and playing together . Pandas are an endangered species , with only around 1,900 now left in the wild , but are notoriously reluctant to breed while in captivity . Ying Ying and Le Le are both 14 years old , around halfway through the normal lifespan of a panda and more than decade into sexual maturity . Scientists had earlier artificially inseminated Ying Ying with sperm from Le Le , but the resulting pregnancy ended in a miscarriage . The pictures come more than two months after the zoo was closed as part of measures intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus in China . Local media report that Le Le had earlier begun leaving trails of scent in different parts of the enclosure and Ying Ying had been spending time in a water pool - both signs they were preparing to mate . In a press release , Michael Boos , executive director for zoological operations and conservation at Ocean Park , said : `` The successful natural mating process today is extremely exciting for all of us , as the chance of pregnancy via natural mating is higher than by artificial insemination . '' It is not yet clear whether Ying Ying is pregnant , but Boos added : `` We hope to bear wonderful pregnancy news to Hong Kongers this year . '' It is estimated that keepers will be able to say whether there is a baby panda on the way by late June . MOST READ IN WORLD NEWS Conservationists have long made the argument that pandas ' reputation for being poor breeders is unfair , and that the problem only effects individuals in captivity . The World Wildlife Foundation 's website says : `` Long-term studies have shown that wild panda populations can have reproductive rates comparable to some American black bear populations , which are thriving .

The timing could have been worse -- the otherwise unremarkable meeting had drawn to a close . Chief Clerk Sue Greene quickly cut off the video feed and , unintentionally , the recording of the meeting once the hijackers interrupted with faux flatulence , cartoon nudity and absurdly manipulated images of the male anatomy . Though the recording is lost , Sheryl Vrabel , executive administrative assistant , had recorded meeting minutes to document board action , Greene said . `` I was trying to make sure this was going to run as smoothly as I could possibly muster . This was new for everyone . What can I say ? '' Greene said after the meeting . Public safety measures enacted as a result of the novel coronavirus pandemic forced many municipal governments to audible away from in-person public meetings . One popular alternative is the use of the video-teleconferencing app , Zoom . It 's easy to use and the basic version is free of charge . It 's also easy to disrupt if a link to a specific meeting is available . The FBI warned users last week to not make meetings or virtual classrooms public , instead use built-in security measures like passwords . This came after hijackers , or `` Zoom-bombers , '' interrupted multiple meetings with sophomoric humor , pornographic imagery and in some instances , racial slurs and imagery . The Union County meeting link was n't password protected and was available on the county website . About 25 people attended , hijackers included . `` It was fine except for the end , '' Chairman Preston Boop said with a laugh . `` The simple solution is I do n't think we 'll allow anybody else to have video , just audio . '' `` At least we have two weeks to figure out how to make it more secure . We 're going to go live-stream and I think everyone will get better , '' Richards said .

At one point from a PA speaker in Guam , Modly called the ship 's former commander , Capt. Brett Crozier `` too naive or too stupid '' to be in command . The sting of the firing was still fresh for sailors hearing Modly 's words . Days earlier , they had chanted Crozier 's name and clapped rhythmically when the dismissed commander solemnly walked off the carrier . `` Everyone 's scared about this thing , '' Modly said at another point in his address to sailors , referring to the coronavirus epidemic in an audio recording given to Task & Purpose . `` If this ship was in combat , and there were hypersonic missiles coming at it , you 'd be pretty f ------ scared , too . '' Modly 's accusation was in response to Crozier 's March 29 email to two dozen Navy officials , sent over an unclassified system when the commander felt his crew was not getting the help he needed to stop the contagion from spreading onboard . The e-mail was leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle , breaching operational security and embarrassing the Navy . Modly at first stood by the at-times rambling self-defense of his firing , then he apologized Monday night . The blunder in Guam was enough for sailors to lose faith in their civilian leader , and for Modly to abandon ship , resigning Tuesday afternoon . In a statement accepting his resignation , Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said Tuesday that Modly had put `` both Navy and the Sailors above self , '' and had resigned of his own accord so that the Roosevelt and the Navy could move forward . As of Monday , the sidelined Roosevelt had already reported 173 COVID positive cases with 61 % of its crew tested . House Armed Services Chair Adam Smith told reporters Tuesday that Modly would have a hard time leading the Navy after the speech . `` What on earth was the acting secretary -LSB- to -RSB- think that that speech was a good idea ? '' he said on a media call before the resignation was made public . `` When I listened to the speech that Acting Secretary Modly gave , it was almost like he was trying to do sort of a half-ass imitation of how Donald Trump would have given a speech , '' he added . Smith quickly blamed President Trump for `` undue command influence , '' and cited Trump 's record of meddling in Defense affairs going back to the sacking of former Navy Secretary Richard Spencer for opposing Trump 's interference in the case of disgraced Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher . `` I see the creeping influence of Trump 's approach undermining the decision-making process within DoD , '' Smith said . The assessment also stems from Modly 's comments to Washington Post journalist David Ignatius that he had fired Crozier out of concern that Trump might intervene . `` The most chilling aspect of that is what he seemed to be saying is , ` Look , I know what I should have done , but what I had to do was I had to say , What would President Trump want me to do ? ''' Smith said , discussing the Modly interview with Ignatius . Following the resignation , Secretary Esper appointed the current Army Undersecretary , 27-year Navy veteran Jim McPherson as the new acting Navy secretary .", "url": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/acting-navy-secretary-resigned-after-half-ass-imitation-of-president-trump", "kws": ["half-ass^^imitation", "President^^Trump", "secretary", "Acting^^Secretary^^Modly", "Navy", "Trump", "Donald^^Trump", "Secretary^^Esper", "Army", "Capt.^^Brett^^Crozier", "Defense^^affairs", "DoD", "Defense^^Mark^^Esper", "reporters", "Guam", "combat", "Eddie^^Gallagher", "COVID-ravaged^^crew^^members", "crew^^members", "self-defense"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 0.92044997215271}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Federal": 0.92044997215271}}}

But in 2012 , Zach Braff almost did n't have a choice but to square up with a man at the premiere of Tom Hooper 's big-screen adaptation , at least according to Braff 's telling on the latest episode of the Scrubs rewatch podcast . And it was n't just any man -- it was the father of the movie 's star and future Oscar winner , Anne Hathaway . `` I know Anne Hathaway as an acquaintance . I 'm walking towards her to say congratulations , '' Braff recalls on the latest episode of Fake Doctors , Real Friends with Donald Faison . `` Her father stands ups and gives me this look like : ` I 'm going to kill this motherf -- er .

It 's a little more complicated than that . Turns out it has to do with Braff 's face . You see , Hathaway once dated a real estate developer named Raffaello Follieri , and he looks eerily like Braff . Hathaway and Follieri broke up in 2008 , a few months before Follieri was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for conspiracy , wire fraud , and money-laundering . `` I got within 10 feet of -LSB- Hathaway 's father -RSB- and his face just f -- ing broke , sighed with a breath of relief realizing it was me and not the ex-boyfriend , '' Braff says .

And there , you can hear the music -LSB- Braff and Faison imitate an angelic chorus -RSB- , is Eddie Murphy standing there .

But there may be no other movie in cinematic history as utterly baffling as Cats . From the confused first trailer reactions to the iconically savage reviews , the film adaptation of the long-running Broadway hit has had countless viewers asking WHAT THE F**K WERE THEY THINKING ?? Well , we may finally have a few more answers thanks to a source spilling to The Daily Beast on Tuesday . The insider claims to have worked on the visual effects team for the box office bomb and 6-time Razzie winner , and to hear them tell it , the biggest problem was director Tom Hooper . The artist says Hooper , who likely got the job because he made the Oscar-winning Les Miserables , lacked even the most basic understanding of how VFX were done , leading to overwhelming delays and needless extra work . For instance , the source says Hooper did n't know what animatics were . Before countless hours are put into a shot , an animatic -- a quick , unrendered version -LRB- picture a kind of fancy stick figure drawing -RRB- is made to make sure the director and VFX team are on the same page about what they are going to be animating . That way hours are n't lost making a shot look great only to find out it is n't right for the movie . Per the source , the director could n't grasp that process and demanded only fully rendered sequences be brought to him for his approval throughout the shoot , lest he say things like `` What 's this garbage ? '' or `` I do n't understand -- where 's the fur ? '' That 's like asking an architect to only make you finished buildings instead of showing you blueprints first ! Hooper even allegedly demanded to see videos of actual cats performing the moves being animated for the film -- which includes its weird cat-people-hybrids doing very human movements , mostly on two legs . Like , you know , singing and dancing . The source quipped : `` And as you know , cats do n`t dance . '' All the extra work meant everything took much longer than it should have . The entire 2-minute first trailer reportedly took an entire first SIX MONTHS of work , leaving only four months to finish the entire rest of the movie . According to the source -LRB- whose statements are in line with rumors we 've been hearing for months -RRB- , the VFX people had to burn the midnight oil throughout that period , working 80-90 hour weeks ; some did n't leave the studio for days at a time . `` It was pure , almost slavery for us , how much work we put into it with no time , and everything was difficult . We were so rushed on the project that we 'd have no time for anything . So when people say , ` Oh , the effects were not good , ' or ` The animation 's not good , ' or anything , that 's not our fault . We have no time . Six months to do a two-minute trailer and four months to do a film of an hour and a half . My math is pretty good ... You could figure that does n't make any sense . '' The lack of time to finish the effects also meant the movie went out with unfinished effects , like performers ' shoes and , most infamously , Judi Dench ` s un-replaced human hand . From what we 've heard across the board from visual effects artist , it 's just about always true that if the effects are bad , it 's a problem of time rather than ability . Even as the VFX artists worked all those hours -LRB- for no extra pay -RRB- , the source says Hooper was consistently `` horrible '' to everyone . `` When you go into a conference room , you 're not allowed to speak . And he talks to you like you 're garbage . '' The director , who was described in the interview as `` disrespectful , '' `` demeaning , '' and `` condescending '' to his VFX supervisors , allegedly sent individual crew members emails blasting their work . Not only is that something no director should do , it 's something no director should even have time for ! Wow . And speaking of buttholes ... You know the interview had to ask what was up with the #ButtholeCut , the widely rumored version of the film in which the effects team had , for some reason , fully animated the naked cat-people 's buttholes . Well , we are delighted to say the rumors are true ! Per the source : `` When we were looking at the playbacks , we were like , ` What the hell ? You guys see that ?! ' We paused it . We went to call our supervisor , and we 're like , ` There 's a f**king a ** hole in there ! There 's buttholes ! ' It was n't prominent but you saw it ... And you -LSB- were -RSB- just like , ` What the hell is that ? ... There 's a f**king butthole in there . ' It was n't in your face -- but at the same time , too , if you 're looking , you 'll see it . '' And yes , someone was specifically tasked with going through frame by frame and digitally brushing out all the buttholes . So how did that happen ? No one knows , apparently ! The source claims : `` There was nobody that said , ` We want buttholes . ' It was one of those things that just happened and slipped through . '' Yeah , buttholes can be slippery like that ... LOLz ! Neither Hooper nor Universal commented on the DB story , but if all this is true , it sounds like the studio and the director owe these effects artists more than an apology .

Matt Bevin has been arrested on federal child pornography charges , authorities said Tuesday .

The charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison . Jones had been serving 15 years for the state charges . The crimes alleged Tuesday stem from the same 2014 sexual assault .

The 200 room dorm will serve as a safe space for medical workers at UAB facilities and first responders to go to prevent the spread of germs to their families or for workers who tested positive and need a safe space to isolate . `` An enormous asset that we 're being able to use in this battle , '' said Reid Jones , UAB Medicine Chief Operating Officer . UAB Officials say packing crews moved out items left behind in the dorms by students who have n't been able to return because of the school closure to limit the spread of COVID-19 . UAB officials believe based on preliminary estimates , this one dorm should be enough to safely house the projected number of people who will need some place to go , but they 're monitoring to decide if other dorms may need to open . `` We do n't know when this is going to be over , but we plan to have the dorm open as long as possible , '' said Jones . For other families of healthcare workers , they 're having to get creative to prevent their loved ones from potential exposure . The Hill family has used their RV for camping trips for the last 2 years . It 's been Matt Hill 's home away from home for the last three and a half weeks . `` My kids typically raise the window in the front and wave outside , '' said Jenna Hill . Jenna Hill usually packs Matt 's dinner in a box and leaves it for him on the table in front of the camper to limit contact . Matt Hill works as a BioMed at Princeton Hospital . The family 's not only concerned about his exposure at work , but their daughter being exposed when he comes home . `` Just being in a hospital all day , every day . We do know the risk involved , '' said Hill , `` With our daughter we just realized it may not be the idea situation at the time , but her life is more important . '' The Hill family says they plan to continue to use their RV in this way until they feel it 's safe .

Studies have shown that remaining active can do wonders for keeping pretty much every part of the body in good shape , and it can even improve a person 's mood . The World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- recommend that everyone engage in `` 150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity physical activity per week , or a combination of both . '' Yet global pandemic control measures mean that for the inhabitants of many countries , the usual avenues for exercise , such as gyms , wellness studios , public swimming pools , and even parks , are now off limits . In many places , regulations even bar people from stepping outside their homes other than making irregular supermarket runs for the bare essentials . In this context , staying active and keeping fit may seem more daunting than ever , but there are several good ways to avoid becoming sedentary even when having to stay home . In this Special Feature , we suggest five things that you can do at any time to increase your level of physical activity from the comfort of your own home . 1 . Gentle calisthenics Calisthenics is a form of exercise that makes use of a person 's body weight to train the major muscles . Some calisthenics -- such as pullups that require a bar -- may be difficult at home , but most of them are achievable . Calisthenics can include squats , crunches , pushups , and planks , all of which people can do pretty much anywhere . A simplified , gentle set of calisthenics -- known as `` radio calisthenics '' because a national , daily radio broadcast invites listeners to participate -- has been a staple of morning exercise in Japan since 1928 . This is one example of `` radio calisthenics , '' but many other light exercise routines are available online : Research has suggested that calisthenics can bring many benefits to both individuals in good health and those with underlying health conditions . For instance , studies have shown that calisthenics may prevent the reduction of skeletal muscle volume in people with type 2 diabetes , improve respiratory muscle strength in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -LRB- COPD -RRB- , and improve posture and body strength in healthy adults . 2 . Home cardio Cardiovascular exercise , or `` cardio '' for short , which is often synonymous with aerobic exercise , works by boosting a person 's heart rate . Examples of cardio exercises include running in place , jumping jacks , lunge jumps , and skipping in place . According to various studies , cardio can help a person lose weight , maintain brain function , and keep cholesterol levels in check . Once again , many online resources can help you come up with a home-based cardio workout . For example , the National Health Service -LRB- NHS -RRB- in the United Kingdom provide a handy 10-minute cardio exercise routine . There are also plenty of other online videos illustrating home cardio workout ideas . The best option will depend on a person 's level of fitness and what they hope to achieve . 3 . Pilates at home Pilates , which has become increasingly popular over the past few decades , is a physical training method that can improve balance and posture , as well as body strength . Physical trainer Joseph Pilates originally developed this practice in the early 20th century . Research has confirmed that a nonstrenuous Pilates routine can improve muscular endurance and flexibility . Other studies have indicated that Pilates can help manage chronic low back pain and possibly even improve sleep quality in some people . People can do most , if not all , Pilates exercises at home , and there are many online videos offering tailored routines to meet specific aims , such as improving back pain . Instructional videos for full body Pilates workouts , such as the one below , are also easy to come by : 4 . Yoga Yoga can also be a good option for staying active and flexible . There are many different types of yoga , each of which has a different level of intensity and difficulty . Anecdotally , yoga can help improve a person 's well-being in many ways , and recent research seems to back such individual reports . Studies have suggested that the benefits of yoga include managing back pain , relieving stress and anxiety , and lifting a person 's mood . There are many different online yoga classes to choose from , but if you have never practiced yoga , it can be hard to know where to start . Medical News Today have curated a list featuring five of the most helpful online yoga channels and interviewed some of the instructors behind them . But there are many other good yoga routines , such as this one , from `` Yoga with Adrienne , '' suggesting a few movements for tension relief : 5 . Fun -LRB- and useful -RRB- home activities It is not always necessary to engage in a structured exercise routine to stay active . Research has shown that simply `` avoiding inactivity '' can make a difference . One study suggested that doing as little as 10 minutes of leisurely activity -- such as gardening or dancing in your living room -- per week is associated with a lower risk of premature death . Therefore , besides a reinvigorating morning workout and a relaxing yoga session before bed , it could be equally healthful to try planting some cilantro in your kitchen garden or having a little disco moment by yourself or with your family . Even doing some regular housework may bring health benefits , beyond ensuring a tidy home and healthful meals . Some researchers have suggested that older men may have poorer health partly because they generally take on less housework than women . Now is the time to engage in all the activities that we never had quite enough time for -- including dusting all those bookshelves -- secure in the knowledge that they will contribute , even just a little , to our well-being .

Although they started simply as a glorified browser OS running on low-power cheap laptops , the product line has stood the test of time to now include high-end hardware , convertible form factors , and support for Android and Linux apps . Part of the confusion in defining Chrome OS can sometimes be gleaned in half-baked features . Today , however , Google closes one of the gaps by making Chrome OS ' tablet mode really feel like you 're using a tablet . Chromebooks have long had touch screens even before they started adopting 2-in-1 convertible forms that flip the screen backward or even detachable devices that split the screen from the keyboard . While Chrome itself and some apps , especially Android apps , do respond properly to touch interactions , interaction with the operating system itself was still based on an older mouse-centric paradigm . As leaked and hinted before , Chrome OS is adopting some touch-based navigation gestures from its cousin , Android . A full swipe up from the bottom dumps users immediately to the home screen while swiping up and holding your position will show the overview of running apps arranged in a grid . Swiping from the left edge is equivalent to the Back action while a small swipe up will bring up the Quick Shelf . It is n't just global navigation that 's getting touch-friendly controls . The Chrome browser itself , for example , will make use of a new tab switcher that shows tabs in mini-windows on a horizontal panel . You can even reorder those tabs , something you ca n't do on Chrome on Android tablets . Whether these new features are also usable outside of Tablet Mode , Google is n't saying . Still , it does go a long way in making convertible and detachable Chromebooks easier to use as a tablet . Almost ironically , it comes a time when Google itself has reportedly ditched any and all of its Chromebook tablet plans .", "url": "https://www.slashgear.com/chrome-os-navigation-gestures-make-chromebooks-feel-like-android-tablets-07615912/", "kws": ["Chrome^^OS", "Android^^tablets", "Android^^apps", "defining^^Chrome^^OS", "Tablet^^Mode", "tablet", "Chromebooks", "running^^apps", "hardware", "Google", "low-power^^cheap^^laptops", "high-end^^hardware", "touch^^screens", "2-in-1^^convertible^^forms", "navigation", "touch-friendly^^controls", "global^^navigation", "product^^line", "tabs", "convertible^^form^^factors"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"TechnologyElectronics": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"TechnologyElectronics_Computers": 1.0000100135803223}}}

In 2015 , McLeod Health said the hospital operated at a $ 10 million loss the previous year and only served an average of 14 patients per day . `` We are working throughout the state , looking to have each of those areas that were identified earlier at a minimum one `` Tier 1 '' and one `` Tier 2 '' facility and we will certainly expand those as needed to accommodate what we believe may be spikes and surges , '' said McCarty . State officials hope by opening these facilities they can take the burden off larger hospital systems . The South Carolina National Guard is following guidelines from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to ensure the compliance of the buildings . All sites being considered must be ADA compliant with adequate restrooms , fire suppression capabilities , and free from lead and asbestos . The South Carolina National Guard and South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control are working out staffing for the hospital surge plan . `` The staffing as identified by Dr. Colley . All of this will be done within the framework of the current hospital system . Any support type needs that are needed to build up these support type facilities , assets such as the national guard could be available to help with that , '' said McCarty . There is no official word on whether the Marlboro Park hospital will be used , but it has been identified as a possible location .", "url": "https://www.wmbfnews.com/2020/04/08/state-leaders-considering-abandoned-marlboro-park-hospital-part-hospital-surge-plan/", "kws": ["hospitals", "State^^officials", "South^^Carolina^^Department", "larger^^hospital^^systems", "Marlboro^^County", "National^^Guard", "S.C.", "Marlboro^^Park", "McLeod^^Health", "Gov.^^Henry^^McMaster", "adequate^^restrooms", "staffing", "Dr.^^Colley", "Bennettsville", "coronavirus^^cases", "coronavirus", "Environmental^^Control", "Van^^McCarty", "Engineers", "guidelines"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Health": 0.6640862226486206}, "second_cat": {"Health_FacilitiesServices": 0.6640862226486206}}}

The new app called Tuned allows couples to send messages , exchange music and create a digital scrapbook . Tuned was created by Facebook 's New Product Experimental Team which focuses on creating new social media from scratch . The app claims to be a `` private space '' for couples to chat but it does not appear to have the end-to-end encryption of services like WhatsApp . Instead Tuned has the same data policy as Facebook , which allows the company to collect communications and other behaviour to target advertising at the user . This data policy could mean users are less inclined to send personal information or private photos via the app . Facebook did not respond to the BBC request for comment about the launch of Tuned . The app is available only to iOS users in the US and Canada and does not require a Facebook account to use it . Facebook announced it was entering the dating space in 2018 . It has launched a dating service to rival Tinder and Bumble in 20 countries so far . But this new couples messaging app is separate from that service . The new product does not appear to be much different from other messaging services . Users add another person using their phone number and once they are connected can send pictures and voice memos and the app has new custom reactions that couples can send to one another . Facebook formed the group that created Tuned - the New Product Experimental Team -LRB- NPE -RRB- - in the summer of 2019 . Its goal is to create new social media services . It has built a meme creation tool and an app for saving and organizing photos similar to Pinterest . When Facebook launched NPE it said the team apps were meant to change rapidly and that its services would be `` shut down if we learn that they 're not useful to people .

Gov. Janet Mills ' stay-at-home order at the end of March shut down nonessential services or activities , including cutting , styling and coloring hair , trimming beards and manicuring nails . Brenda Henry of Lewiston , a client of Richard Stone 's Orbit Hair Stylings in Lewiston , said she schedules appointments , without fail , every eight weeks to get her hair cut and colored . The stay-at-home order has her facing what she called `` a female crisis . '' `` I need to look beautiful , and right now , the grays are out there , '' Henry said . `` I refuse to use a box to color my hair , and now , because of COVID-19 , I have to wait . '' Henry said the salon livestreamed demonstrations on how to cover up roots with scarves or bandanas but `` I could n't figure it out . '' `` I 'm using a headband , which is fine for the moment , but it 's going to get worse , '' Henry said . `` I told the salon that I want to be first on the list of appointments . '' Christine Eirby , another regular at Orbit Hair Stylings , said she last visited the salon Feb. 20 , and `` wo n't have anyone touch my hair -LRB- except -RRB- Richard . '' `` I 'm waiting it out , '' she said . `` I 'm a faithful client . '' Stone , who employs 11 people , said he has been able to keep one person employed full-time through the shutdown by relying on a special marketing campaign . `` We 're selling conditioners mixed with specific hair color tones and shipping it to people , '' he said . `` People will text us photos of their hair and we 'll formulate hair coloring into the conditioner to match the color of their hair . '' He said the coronavirus pandemic is n't the first time he 's had to see his business through a period of uncertainty . `` I started the salon in 2002 and moved to Lewiston in 2007 , and right after we moved , that 's when the recession hit , '' Stone said . `` I made it through the recession by selling everything in my house . I 've been through this sort of paranoia before , and after that , I had the forethought to save my pennies for a rainy day , just in case something like that happened again . '' However , some salon owners , including Angela Bontempo , who runs Two Lips Hair Salon in Lewiston , said the stay-at-home order has her questioning whether she 'll be able to stay open if the order extends past April 30 . She said when COVID-19 first began making its way through Maine , she `` was n't phased about the loss of income and surely did n't fathom the thought of having to close my business . '' `` If I did n't have my husband , I 'd be moving back home at this point and shutting my salon doors , '' Bontempo said . `` If I do n't get help financially from the government , then I 'll close my shop on May 1 . '' Bontempo said the governor 's order `` includes no visiting one-on-one for hair appointments at my home or -LRB- clients ' homes -RRB- . '' `` Personally , I 'd rather not expose myself just for someone 's hair color or cut , '' Bontempo added . `` It 's a superficial want . It 's not necessary . '' In an effort to be proactive , Bontempo said she applied for 14 jobs over the past two weeks , but the businesses who called back said they were `` holding off on interviewing until it 's safe to lift the quarantine . '' Some of her clients said they 're willing to wait until the order ends before doing anything to their hair . `` As a client , basically , I 'm just going to rock long hair until I can get it cut , '' said Drew Dickinson . Amanda Richardson , who also considers herself a regular client of Bontempo , said it has been three weeks since her last hair and nail appointment and her `` nails are a mess . '' `` Right now , my nails are in need of a fill , and if this -LRB- stay-at-home order -RRB- goes past the 30 days , I 'll end up taking -LRB- the nails -RRB- off , '' Richardson said . She said her husband and son `` need a haircut desperately , '' adding , `` I 'll end up having to attempt it myself . '' `` I think , unfortunately , women in today 's world are expected to look a certain way , '' Richardson said . `` This pandemic is tough for everyone . '' Krista Spring , a cosmetologist who works at Jewlz Beyond Hair in Naples , wrote on Bontempo 's Facebook page that she had to walk her sister through giving a haircut by using the FaceTime application on her phone . Brigitte Whitten , who has been self-employed for seven and a half years at Hairbenders on Center Street in Auburn , said her clients `` are pretty loyal and most will not attempt to do their own hair . '' `` My clients are not just clients to me ; they are friends and some have become like family to me , '' Whitten continued . `` They know they can reach out and I 'll help them if I can . '' Bontempo said despite the closure of salons , people should n't worry about the color of their roots showing or their hair growing out . `` Who 's going to see their hair anyways ? '' Bontempo asked with a laugh . `` If they 're supposed to be staying home and it 's gray , everyone will understand why . '' -LSB- email protected -RSB- Hi , to comment on stories you must .

The American Society of Reproductive Medicine even put out a statement to all fertility centers . `` The statement said that all fertility clinics should suspend the initiation of new treatment cycles , '' Dr. Gunnala said . This means patients are being seen , but not starting any fertility treatments . `` We have to minimize patient and staff exposure to the virus . So the stopping of treatment had to be done . So to flatten that curve and reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 , '' said Dr. Gunnala . The practice immediately began changing everything they do . Limiting patient visits , reducing staff in the office , and over sanitizing everything all day long . For Dr. Gunnala , the stopping of treatment was met with mixed emotions . `` Their are positive and negatives to the whole situation , but I immediately thought of my patients because each has their own IVF journey and that journey is different for every patient and for those who were so close and had to stop , I was heartbroken , '' Dr. Gunnala said . `` Not sure there is any better job . I think it 's one of lifes highest privileges to be a mom , '' said Shelly Batra , an IVF patient . Batra and her fianc\u00e9 went to Dr. Gunnala after she had suffered two late first term miscarriages . `` So at the time all of the recommendations came out about coronavirus , we were two days away from out first transfer , '' said Batra . Batra , who is a pediatric doctor at a Valley hospital , had to make a tough decision . `` Due to my increased exposure due to my job , we decided it 'd be best to wait , '' said Batra . `` I look at other women that are just starting IVF , I ca n't come to imagine the difficulties and stress of being told this and put you on hold indefinitely , '' said Mandy Oliden , another IVF patient . Oliden is also a patient of Dr. Gunnala ; she and her husband were struggling to get pregnant on their own and did their first IVF transfer back in January . `` I 'll be 13 weeks tomorrow , '' said Oliden . Oliden , is also a pediatrician , but is now working from home because she knows how scary it could be if she got the coronavirus while she is pregnant . She also knows that with every pregnancy milestone she hits , each one is a blessing . `` To have that even despite COVID-19 scares , its still a miracle a blessing in and of itself '' said Oliden . For now , the American Society of Reproductive Medicine is putting out updated guidelines for doctors every two weeks . For patients , it 's all a wait and see . `` When this begins to clear up and we feel it is safe we will go ahead . For other women going through IVF I would tell them , stick with it , stay positive . You are stopped for now , but you did this for your baby , it will happen for you , and remember you did it for good reason , '' said Batra .", "url": "https://www.azfamily.com/news/continuing_coverage/coronavirus_coverage/covid-19-stopping-all-fertility-treatments-for-valley-couples/article_c33f8754-792f-11ea-8b45-c77d8a603017.html", "kws": ["fertility^^treatments", "treatments", "IVF", "Southwest^^Fertility^^Center", "treatment", "Reproductive^^Medicine", "doctors", "couples", "Reproductive^^Specialist", "patient^^visits", "Dr.^^Gunnala", "lifes^^highest^^privileges", "Valley", "Dr.^^Vinay^^Gunnala", "American^^Society", "coronavirus", "sanitizing^^everything", "Mandy^^Oliden", "unprecedented^^times", "Shelly^^Batra"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Health": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Health_Other": 1.0000100135803223}}}

She is doing so , by putting on adult content using webcam shows . Adult entertainment workers that have been put out of work because of the COVID-19 health crisis will benefit from Ward 's `` webcam girl '' content . Ward , played Rachel McGuire in ` Boy Meets World ' , a 90 's sitcom and also starred in ' Bold and Beautiful . ' She is now set to put out a weekly performance for fans on CamSoda , a webcam site . The adult entertainer , 42 , will give fans a live show that will go on for an hour every week on Thursdays at 7 pm . Her goal , according to Daily Star is to raise at least $ 1,000 a week -- $ 4,000 a month , which will then be donated to organizations such as Free Speech Coalition 's , an emergency performer 's fund . This past Thursday , on April 2 , 2020 , her live stream resulted in her raising $ 1,014 , which is over 21,000 in tokens . On her decision to do the webcam show , Ward revealed , `` This community has been so open and welcoming to me , and I just want to give back in any way I can by supporting performers from all over , and donating as much money as possible to organizations that support this industry . '' She also said that she subscribed to 150 + OnlyFans accounts to support them `` I went online and asked all performers who wanted their OnlyFans pages advertised that I would purchase and retweet their handles , '' she said . In a recent interview with The Wrap , Ward revealed how the coronavirus lockdown has allowed her to make more content and her existing content has been in higher demand thanks to people seeking out means to entertain themselves while stuck at home . `` Actually , I 've seen upticks in some of my income because people are home and they want entertainment and they want to get away from all the corona stuff , '' Ward said . `` People are hunkered down and so they want to see content , '' Ward explained . `` That 's a remarkable thing -- that we can earn good money in a crisis like this , when a lot of people are hurting . I 'm really grateful for that . '' She is using this surge in demand to cater to the charities as well . She hit fame because of family-oriented roles and cosplay pictures on social media with her posts leading to her gaining an incredible amount of followers , the count grew as Ward shared nude pictures and other adult content for Patreon subscribers . After one of his stars dropped out of Drive , CEO Kayden Kross , content turned the head of Deeper.com decided to work with Ward . Ward said , `` Adult films gave me that power . I said , ` screw it . I 'm going to keep doing my thing ' . And now , I 'm one of the top names on OnlyFans . I have a contract . It 's amazing . I find it so empowering that at my age I can be this sexual being , and they do n't call me a MILF ... I 'm just a sexually empowered woman . I do n't want to label myself as anything .

TRENTON -- Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal and Colonel Patrick J. Callahan , Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police , announced the following recent enforcement actions against violators of Governor Murphy 's Emergency Orders related to COVID-19 : Newark Enforcement . The Newark Police Department 's COVID-19 task force issued 38 summonses for violations of the emergency orders in enforcement actions yesterday , April 6 . Oscar Diaz , 40 , of Elizabeth , was charged last night , April 6 , with second-degree terroristic threats during an emergency , third-degree aggravated assault on an officer , third-degree resisting arrest , fourth-degree throwing bodily fluid at an officer , obstruction -LRB- disorderly persons offense -RRB- and simple assault/domestic violence . Police responded to a domestic violence call reporting a stabbing . Diaz , who had blood on his face and shirt , allegedly kicked , punched and pushed officers in an attempt to keep them from entering the residence , causing officers to use pepper spray . As Diaz was being physically escorted by officers to a patrol car , he allegedly yelled `` COVID ! COVID ! , '' coughed on the officers , and attempted to spit on them . Dasia Syms , 31 , of Camden , was charged on Sunday , April 5 , with fourth-degree causing or risking widespread injury , fourth-degree contempt , disorderly conduct , and failure to disperse -LRB- disorderly persons offense -RRB- . Camden police officers discovered a large group of people outside and exiting a reside.Willow Walk . When police advised the group to disperse and go home because of the state of emergency , Syms allegedly cursed and said `` I do not have to go anywhere , '' creating a scene . She then allegedly stated she had the coronavirus and began to cough.There were more than five people present when she coughed , including officers . Nikolas Whitehill , 39 , of Parsippany , was charged with violating the emergency orders . Police were called about a domestic matter involving Whitehill and his estranged wife . By court order , the wife has sole possession of their house , but Whitehill is permitted to enter the house on alternating dates , when the victim is not home , to feed their fish . The wife provided police with security footage from March 28 of Whitehill alone inside the house , where he was coughing on objects and touching objects , saying he had `` the rona '' and `` Do you want the rona ? '' Thomas J. Wilson , 56 , of Monroe Township , was charged with violating the emergency orders on Sunday , April 5 , for having a gathering of 15 to 20 people in the backyard of his house in Seaside Park . Ryan Coolahan , 24 , of Monmouth Beach , was charged on Saturday , April 4 , with criminal trespass and violation of the emergency orders , both disorderly persons offenses . Sea Bright Police responded to an alarm at the Monmouth Beach municipal pavilion , which had been closed to the public due to the pandemic , with temporary fencing placed around the building . When police arrived , they found Coolhan inside the pavilion smoking and playing music .

Police found Affatoto fishing off of a boat ramp in a park that is closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic . Angel Martinez , 34 , of Camden , was charged on the night of April 4 with two violations of the emergency orders . Police responded to a gathering on North 6th Street in Camden . When Martinez was served with a warning about gatherings , he ripped it up and discarded it , saying he does not care about getting a fine because he has money in the bank . The group dispersed Trenton Enforcement . Police in Trenton issued two summonses for violations of the emergency orders and ordered one non-essential business closed in enforcement actions yesterday , April 6 . `` Our police officers are working bravely and tirelessly every day to protect us during this health crisis . Regrettably , they are being called upon far too often to deal with people violating the emergency orders -- or what is more egregious , people using the virus to spread fear or impede officers in their vital work , '' said Attorney General Grewal . `` Staying home and maintaining social distance is n't just the best advice to stay healthy , it 's the law . Make no mistake , we will do everything in our power to keep our residents and officers safe , and that means we wo n't hesitate to file charges against violators . '' `` Law enforcement and medical professionals are on the frontlines of this battle to protect the citizens of New Jersey from the COVID-19 virus , and we can not stress enough how important it is that each person follow the guidelines set forth in the Executive Order , '' said Colonel Patrick Callahan , Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police . `` Because lives are at stake , enforcement action will be taken without hesitation against those who are blatantly placing the lives of others at risk . '' Violations of the emergency orders constitute a disorderly persons offense carrying a potential sentence of up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $ 1,000 . However , violators can potentially face criminal charges including second , third , and fourth degree indictable offenses . Last week , Attorney General Grewal announced enhanced charges against six individuals who were charged with assaulting law enforcement officers and violating the emergency orders . Specifically , those enhanced charges included making terroristic threats during a state of emergency , which is a second degree offense and carries a sentence of five to 10 years in state prison and a fine of up to $ 150,000 . The defendant Diaz is similarly charged for his conduct against law enforcement officers . Third-degree charges carry a sentence of three to five years in prison and a fine of up to $ 15,000 , while fourth-degree charges carry a sentence of up to 18 months in prison and a fine of up to $ 10,000 . The charges are merely accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty . If you are seeing a lack of compliance with the Governor 's emergency orders in your town , please contact your local police department or report here covid19.nj.gov / violation The Attorney General 's Office and New Jersey State Police will continue to work with law enforcement throughout New Jersey to deter non-complaint behavior .

He neglects to tell Julia that , in addition to standing alone onstage wearing a spotlight and nothing else , he woke up in his dream to find Ellis lying shirtless beside him . That 's a horrible dream , indeed ! Now it 's the invited dress , when all your friends in the industry come to see the last performance before people start paying to see the show ... which is at the `` Lily Hayes Theatre . '' -LRB- According to show runner Joshua Safran , the Lyceum ended up with that new name because Lily Hayes Kaufman was the name of the series ' line producer 's assistant . -RRB- It 's a quite small invited dress -- normally they 're a bit more packed -- which is all for the best since among other blunders Ivy ends up baring all during the JFK scene . That bit of unscheduled nudity prompts a landslide of press and an avalanche of ticket sales , enough so that Eileen and Julia think it works in the show . Will Ivy go for it ? Since Eileen volunteers to speak to her , I imagine she will . At Hit List , Karen and Derek are worried that their roles will be sacrificed in favor of Ana 's The Diva , and they only have a few hours to run through the whole show before Richard Francis from The New York Times attends their stumble through ! Derek has enough time and inspiration to create a new opening , highlighting The Diva . It 's a genuinely thrilling moment , watching a musical come together in rehearsal and exactly the kind of thing that , when Smash got it right , made the show so delectable for theatre fans . Of course , Jimmy and Karen think that the new opening , which has The Diva sing a snippet of `` Broadway Here I Come '' is in reaction to Derek finding out about their relationship . Jimmy yells at Derek , Derek acts hoity-toity and reminds us that he left Broadway for Hit List , and Kyle -- betrays Jimmy and agrees that Derek 's idea is better for the show ! Twist ! Jimmy immediately decides that Kyle agrees with Derek because he 's also jealous of his relationship with Karen . No one cares about you and Karen , Jimmy ! And Karen lets Ana know that she got Karen 's song just because Derek 's pissed at her . These two deserve one another . Over at the Lily Hayes , Ivy is debating getting naked on purpose . But Sam points out that he did Take Me Out -- and can Ivy remember the plot of that show ? She ca n't ! -LRB- It 's about baseball ! -RRB- She still does n't know what she 'll do even during the show , which now includes the ensemble of `` Dig Deep '' crawling through the audience which gives me heebie jeebies . Ivy does get naked -- but not at the same point it happened the night before . Instead of getting naked before a seduction , she gets naked in an effort to keep JFK with her ... which does n't work , making it all the more heartbreaking . But no one is talking about the full frontal nudity in Bombshell once Richard Francis publishes his story comparing Hit List and Bombshell -- and discreetly coming out in favor of Hit List . Tom loses his temper with Julia ; Eileen loses her temper with Richard Francis ; and for once , the team at Hit List do n't lose their tempers !

Keith Rizzo -LRB- 23 -RRB- has been sentenced to 22 yrs in prison for the murder of Neomi Smith in #Brechin in 2019 . Her family said ' We are devastated .

' pic.twitter.com/bo8ljpr47h -- Tayside Police -LRB- @TaysidePolice -RRB- April 6 , 2020 When murder is involved between once-romantic partners , the crime is often brutal and personal . That was the case regarding the murder of 23-year-old Neomi Smith on June 9th , 2019 . That evening , her live-in boyfriend Keith Rizzo had been at a local pub with Smith , when he witnessed her dancing with another patron inside the bar . Cameron Saunders , a former friend of the murderer , was there that evening when Smith 's dancing with another man sent Rizzo into a rage : `` They were bumping bums . They were dancing away for a while when Keith said : ` that 's enough .

She replied : ` Yes ' . She told me that she would lock the door and would keep her key in , so he could not use his to gain access . '' That was the final conversation that Cameron had with Smith before she was murdered . Rizzo made his way back into the loft the two lived in together , kicking in the door . He began to choke Smith , and then stabbed her 32 times using two different knives . The autopsy also uncovered massive amounts of blunt force trauma . Rizzo attempted to cover the murder up claiming that two men had broken in and killed Smith . Investigators debunked that notion relatively quickly as there was simply zero evidence to support the concocted story . Keith Rizzo had tried to claim a mystery pair knifed Neomi in a bid to avoid responsibility for his horrific crime . https://t.co/NRfy8FoXRi -- The Daily Record -LRB- @Daily_Record -RRB- April 6 , 2020 Stephen Alexander , a neighbor of Smith , had called the police after seeing the aftermath of the murder . He described the scenery in grim detail : `` I saw a scene of carnage . There was glass and debris all over the kitchen . It looked as though a battle had taken place . There was bottles of sauce , fruit and vegetables amongst the broken glass . '' When one of the first paramedics , Angela McKenzie , responded to the flat , she described what looked to be something from a horror film . When she checked Smith 's sustained injuries on her neck and face , the numerous punctures became almost too much to keep count of : `` I ca n't even describe it -- it was like Leerdammer cheese . It was full of holes -- the back of her head and her neck . I gave up counting how many holes there were . '' With as brutal as the murder was , 22 years seems hardly enough for the crime . While deemed life sentences in Scotland dictate that the entire prison term must be served , it still seems like far too lenient a sentence .

The very day she reported Gannon missing on January 27th , police believe a murder happened inside his home instead of the alleged roadside kidnapping she reported . According to the affidavit , investigators uncovered evidence found inside the child 's bedroom : `` Evidence recovered from the residence and inside Gannon 's bedroom supports that a violent event occurred in the bedroom which caused bloodshed , including blood spatter on the walls , and enough blood loss to stain his mattress , soak through the carpet , the carpet pad , and stain the concrete below his bed . '' Even with Letecia in custody on March 5th , there was still one thing missing . They could n't locate the young boy 's body . Authorities were certain that Leticia had moved the body somewhere and was involved with his murder . There were too many clues pointing in her direction . Perhaps the most concerning was the alleged text message she sent her own 17-year-old daughter on January 27th . In the alleged text , she 'd asked her daughter to purchase trash bags , baking soda , and carpet powder .

Things simply did n't add up . Another damning link in the investigation of Leticia was her internet search history prior to the boy 's murder . Leticia had reportedly searched the following online : `` police steps for our runaway , '' `` police steps for our missing child , '' `` find me a new husband book , '' `` I feel like I 'm just a nanny not a step mom , '' `` husband uses me to babysit his kids , '' `` I 'm just a glorified babysitter , '' and `` find a guy without kids .

The pair decided to visit the doctor to find out if their baby is healthy . Ahead of their consultation , the two had a conversation about their baby and if she would be average-sized or a dwarf . While Tori did not have a problem with their daughter being either , she admitted that the biggest thing for her was to hear the news about her health . The pair finally reached for their consultation . Once the scan was done , Tori and Zachary were informed that their baby was most likely to be a dwarf . Tori was informed that the head of their child was bigger and the bones were not growing at the rate that they should . However , the doctor revealed that the health of the baby was otherwise good . The couple was happy to know that nothing was wrong but Tori was put in a spot where nervousness took the better of her . Once the two reached their car , Tori confessed that she did not want to do a C-section as she did with their son , Jackson because the healing process had been a lot for her . However , she worried if her vagina will tear if she decided to opt for a natural delivery with her daughter . She feared that the baby 's head might pose to be a problem since it was larger in size . Tori joked that she was happy with how her vagina looked and wondered if she wanted two of her body parts to be damaged . Apart from this , Tori also worried that being a dwarf and a girl , there might be times when she may not be able to answer the questions that their daughter is looking for . Zachary admitted that Jackson will always have him to look up to but for their daughter , things would be different as she would not have the same life as Tori . Tori admitted that girls are more emotional in nature and there is a lot of problems that girls face right now . She wondered how things would be for their daughter as being a dwarf would take their problems up a notch . Zachary tried to explain that being a parent means handling their children and their problems . He assured her that their daughter would always have someone beside her while adding that Jackson will always be there for her .

' But curves might be flattening", "content": "Pennsylvania , New Jersey , and the region reached new highs with their daily reports of coronavirus deaths on Tuesday ; the Garden State closed its parks ; and Philadelphia warned of impending `` painful '' cuts while imploring religious leaders to hold only virtual services during the High Holy Days . Those bleak developments notwithstanding , officials were continuing to see budding , if not quite blooming , signs for optimism that the virus and its insidious siege of anxiety eventually will relent . While the numbers keep climbing on both sides of the river -- up to 240 virus-related deaths in Pennsylvania , 1,232 in New Jersey , and 200 in Philadelphia and its neighboring counties -- the case curves have been flattening in both states , which officials attribute to social distancing practices . Gov. Phil Murphy said he had spoken with Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and other governors about preliminary plans for a slow return to business . But he also indicated that the suspension of business as usual will be the routine for a while longer . The Inquirer Coronavirus Newsletter Science-based coverage sent daily to your inbox -- all facts , no panic `` We must not just flatten this curve , '' he said . `` We must crush this curve . '' He said the state was n't out of the woods yet , and that is why he closed them . He ordered all state forests and state and county parks shut indefinitely . `` We are seeing far too many instances of people gathering in groups in our parks erroneously thinking that since they 're outside , social distancing does n't matter , '' he said . `` Nothing could be further from the truth . '' New Jersey also announced it was postponing its primary , scheduled for June 2 , to July 7 . And Murphy stopped just short of saying that families can forget about graduation ceremonies . `` In my shoes , you would n't be dealing with the facts if I were to say publicly right now you should feel OK about a late May , early June graduation celebration , '' he said . New Jersey on Tuesday reported 232 new coronavirus deaths , the highest in any of its daily reports , although it was unclear when the deaths had occurred . Pennsylvania reported 78 , and the Philadelphia region , 47 , both the highest for daily updates . New Jersey 's case count rose above 44,000 , and Pennsylvania 's approached 15,000 . However , they have not been doubling every one to two days as they were last week . One disturbing trend has been `` significant increases '' in the number of Pennsylvania nursing homes and long-term care centers that have reported at least one positive case of the coronavirus , state officials said . But Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine said she did n't have detailed data . In Philadelphia , more than 45 firefighters and paramedics have tested positive for the virus , according to department sources , and about 140 firefighters and paramedics are still awaiting test results . The Fire Department has 2,700 firefighters and medics . SEPTA , which has lost three employees to the coronavirus , is dramatically slashing service and as of Thursday will institute a `` lifeline service schedule . '' It will be closing subway stations , limiting bus and trolley service , and suspending some Regional Rail lines . `` If you do n't need to be out on the system , I 'm begging you , please stay off the system , '' said Fran Kelly , SEPTA assistant general manager for public and government affairs . Realistically , people simply do n't have many places to go with so many businesses and institutions shut down because of the pandemic . And the fallout has hit the city 's tax coffers profoundly . Mayor Jim Kenney said Tuesday that the city stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars , forcing severe budget cuts and service reductions . He said the losses would force the city to make decisions `` the likes of which have never been needed . `` To what degree , we do n't yet know , '' he said at a news conference . `` But it will affect things that people care about and expect from their city government . I know full well that any reductions in city services will be painful . '' Kenney will scrap the $ 5.2 billion spending plan that he proposed to City Council in March for the coming fiscal year , and will present a new budget plan to Council on May 1 . An analysis by the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority -LRB- PICA -RRB- found that the city could lose up to $ 400 million in revenue in the current quarter , which ends June 30 . Not surprisingly , Americans ' outlook on health and the economy has taken a steep downturn in recent weeks . The survey of 1,200 people found just under 40 % losing work or income because of the coronavirus . Anxiety of affording health care increased , along with mental-health problems . That said , the poll found a sharp increase in the number of people who are taking recommended precautions to protect against contracting the virus . More than 90 % of respondents said they are taking measures such as canceling travel plans , skipping group events , and staying home from work . That has been quite evident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike , where traffic has dropped 76.5 % since residents were told to stay home and commercial vehicle traffic has decreased by 27.5 % , state police said , adding that Pennsylvanians are `` getting the message '' on social distancing . `` The mitigation strategies we believe are beginning to work , '' Lt. Col. Scott Price told reporters on a phone call . And Pennsylvania anglers received some good news Tuesday with the announcement that trout season had begun , almost two weeks earlier than scheduled . The state said it moved up the date to discourage a concentration of people gathering on its traditional opening day , to minimize travel , and to reduce the threat of illegal poaching in waters that have already been stocked . The state suggests wearing face masks , keeping at least six feet away from other anglers , and not sharing fishing gear . And the coronavirus has not deterred the Easter Bunny , a.k.a. Aaron Talasnik , 42 , who wears a bunny costume while walking his dog Charlie in Center City . `` I think a lot of people right now are struggling , '' he said . `` I ca n't afford to help financially , and I am not a doctor or nurse . I see this as a way to brighten people 's day .

At Magic Tree in Boardman , owner John Rudy and his staff are trying to work magic of their own - weathering the storm the Coronavirus pandemic has wrought . `` New problems come up every day and we just adapt and adjust , '' Rudy says . Governor DeWine 's order announced Tuesday - allowing carry-out beer , wine and liquor - looks to soften the blow . As long as the establishment has a liquor license , it can sell and deliver drinks in a closed container - no more than two per meal . `` It 's definitely going to help , '' says Rudy . `` We have the product here and the product has just been sitting . '' There are other rules - so many places are taking the time to figure out how they 'll make the most of this opportunity . `` We 're going to comply with everything we can and then we 're going to make some recipes and see what we can do with our inventory and our mixes , '' says Rudy . Steel City Bar and Grill is breathing a small sigh of relief too . Manager Tom Tulipano says he 's already working to meet demand for his patrons ' favorite drinks . `` Something 's better than nothing right now , '' Tulipano said . `` I 've already ordered in special cups keep it traditional size , normal drinks are a nine ounce cup , so our nine ounce carry out glasses with the lid and they 've got to be sealed so I ordered stickers to put over top of the thing , so it 's completely sealed and wo n't be open . '' So while the drinks wo n't be open , this new order from Columbus means watering holes and restaurants across the Buckeye State will still be . `` Maybe even bring back an employee or two because of the extra revenue , '' says Rudy . Details of the complete order from Governor DeWine are as follows : `` The Ohio Liquor Control Commission passed an emergency rule to allow establishments with an existing on-premises liquor permit to sell and deliver alcohol , including high-proof liquor in limited quantity , for off-premises consumption . Breweries can also now sell beer and wine that are not their own without food purchase , but food purchase is required for the sale of high-proof liquor . Under the rule , patrons can purchase no more than two drinks per meal . All drinks must be closed and remain closed during transport as per the open container law cited in ORC 4301.01 -LRB- B -RRB- -LRB- 6 -RRB- . Drinks can not contain more than two ounces of spirituous liquor per container . This rule will remain in effect for up to 120 days unless rescinded by the Liquor Control Commission , whichever occurs first . Similar emergency rulings have been enacted recently in other states , such as New York and Texas , to provide some financial relief to restaurants and bars that have had to close their dining rooms to contain the spread of COVID-19 . As always , patrons are encouraged to drink responsibly and obey all applicable laws .

Nevada Gold Mines has requested that the Nevada Department of Transportation install a flashing pedestrian crossing at Mountain City Highway and Terminal Way . The company is headquartered near the intersection . The Elko City Council on Tuesday deliberated the possibility of becoming an NDOT permittee in order to move the project forward . `` I think it 's important to have that , '' said Mayor Reece Keener . `` We all travel up and down Mountain City Highway and we can see the pedestrian traffic there -LSB- is busy -RSB- particularly on business days and since they have the Hampton Inn across the street . '' `` Since the Hampton hotel has been put in , there have been many pedestrians walking across the road with suitcases going to the airport , '' said Elko City Councilman Robert Schmidtlein . He said on rainy mornings it is a very blind area . In an earlier discussion , which included NDOT , City of Elko and Nevada Gold Mines representatives , it was suggested that if NDOT would commit to the financial cost of design and construction the City of Elko would agree to accept maintenance going forward . `` I think it would be poor practice for the City of Elko to start looking at a third party agreement for maintenance of this type of infrastructure , '' said Scott Wilkinson , assistant city manager . `` I will add that if the City of Elko is not interested in being the permittee that we probably would not see that project move forward .

Judge James Bredar noted in his ruling that the U.S. Supreme Court has consistently maintained that physical differences between men and women provide a constitutionally sound basis for laws that treat men and women differently . Bredar also determined that protecting the public sensibilities from the public display of areas of the body traditionally viewed as erogenous zones , including female , but not male , breasts , is an important government objective . `` Whether or not society should differentiate between male and female breasts is a separate inquiry from whether it is constitutional to do so , '' wrote Bredar , adding that Ocean City 's ban on female toplessness is substantially related to protecting the public sensibilities . Five women sued Ocean City officials in 2018 , arguing that they had the right to appear topless in public like men . The lawsuit was filed after city officials passed an emergency ordinance in 2017 prohibiting the nude display of a person 's specified anatomical areas . Those areas included the male and female genital regions and the female breast . Local officials passed the ordinance after one of the plaintiffs sent letters to local authorities stating her intention to go topless , touching off a community debate . -LRB- \u00a9 Copyright 2020 The Associated Press .

A new `` smart toilet '' has been created to help people find early signs of health problems in their poop and urine . The technology was designed to find disease markers of cancer , irritable bowel syndrome and kidney failure , among other conditions . Researchers said the toilet may be helpful particularly to people who are genetically predisposed to certain conditions . `` Our concept dates back well over 15 years , '' Sanjiv Gambhir , a professor and chair of radiology at Stanford Medicine , said in a statement . `` When I 'd bring it up , people would sort of laugh because it seemed like an interesting idea , but also a bit odd . '' The smart toilet finds signs of diseases through a set of gadgets inside the bowl . The technology uses motion sensing to start testing the user 's urine and poop . A built-in camera first records the deposits and uses algorithms to analyze stool consistencies and normal `` urodynamics , '' like flow rate , stream time and total volume . The toilet also releases urinalysis strips to directly measure molecular features of samples . The smart toilet then sends data to a cloud-based system for safekeeping and further assessment . Gambhir said he hopes the system may soon be integrated into health care provider 's systems for easy access . The researchers tested the smart toilet with 21 participants . The technology appeared capable of detecting 10 different biomarkers and many people expressed that they were very comfortable using it . `` The thing about a smart toilet , though , is that unlike wearables , you ca n't take it off , '' Gambhir said . `` Everyone uses the bathroom -- there 's really no avoiding it -- and that enhances its value as a disease-detecting device . '' Smart Toilet : Your Anus Is Your Fingerprint Gambhir hopes that the smart toilet would become part of the average home bathroom . He also designed an add-on tool that can be integrated into any old porcelain bowl . Aside from providing a faster way to detect diseases , the smart technology also promises to secure user data . The toilet has a built-in identification system that includes a flush lever that reads fingerprints and a tool that scans the anus for user recognition . Gambhir said each person 's `` anal print is unique . '' But he noted the doctor or health care provider receiving data from the smart toilet will not access the anus images . The researchers plan to enhance the smart toilet with new molecular analysis for stool samples . The team also aims to test the technology with more participants .", "url": "https://www.medicaldaily.com/new-smart-toilet-checks-poop-urine-detect-cancer-kidney-problems-more-451569", "kws": ["Kidney^^Problems", "Smart^^Toilet", "Detecting^^diseases", "stool^^samples", "irritable^^bowel^^syndrome", "disease^^markers", "urinalysis^^strips", "health^^problems", "Cancer", "algorithms", "molecular^^features", "stool^^consistencies", "user^^data", "fingerprints", "health^^care^^provider", "gadgets", "people", "Stanford^^Medicine", "flow^^rate", "laugh"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Health": 0.9954432249069214}, "second_cat": {"Health_Other": 0.9954432249069214}}}

A post shared by Ariel Helwani -LRB- @arielhelwani -RRB- on Apr 7 , 2020 at 1:48 pm PDT With travel restrictions across the globe preventing fighters from making it out of their respective homelands , Ultimate Fighting Championship -LRB- UFC -RRB- has had to adjust and shuffle its upcoming slate of fights , beginning with UFC 249 . Indeed , the pay-per-view -LRB- PPV -RRB- event will now feature an interim Lightweight title fight between Justin Gaethje and Tony Ferguson , who will collide on April 18 , 2020 , as a result of Khabib Nurmagomedov being stuck in Russia . And just like Gaethje took advantage of someone else 's unfortunate situation , Dominick Cruz is ready to do the same . `` The Dominator '' says he is ready and willing to face UFC Bantamweight champion , Henry Cejudo , at UFC 250 on May 9 , 2020 , should Jose Aldo be unable to fly out of Brazil . `` Now he -LSB- Cejudo -RSB- is saying that Aldo may not be able to get in , and Yan may not be able to get in . And now the MMA world can know that this fight is a real possibility , '' Cruz said during a recent interview with ESPN 's Ariel Helwani . `` That 's really the situation , since they ca n't come in , it opens up a slot for me to slide in there . And I will always take a fight with the title . That 's what we do this for , you slide in and take the title shot when it 's there . And realistically , with Aldo and Yan out and this opportunity there , why would n't I take it ? That 's what I have been asking for a long time , '' he added , before saying that there is no telling if Cejudo will actually back up his words of giving Cruz the title shot if all else fails . `` However , I also believe that Henry has a habit of saying things just to get the hype to get people talking about it , or to talk about him , '' he concluded . Aldo may not be out of the fight just yet , though , as Dana White recently revealed that he is in the process of acquiring a private island to allow his international stars to fight during the coronavirus pandemic . Should Cruz get the fight , it will be the former champion 's first taste of action since late 2016 , as multiple injuries have forced him to sit on the sidelines for the last 40 months .

It may be that he was the Director for Planned Parenthood California Central Coast or that he just did not actually read Peggy Wilson 's letter . To be very clear , when I read Scott 's commentary I can agree with almost everything he says . Every single parent and community member that I have talked to about this wants our kids to have proper health and sex education . The small group of youth in Planned Parenthood shirts that handed out Planned Parenthood swag to the Board of Directors and Scott McCann seem to be the only people in Support of Teen Talk however . Sex education will not reach the kids unless parents , teachers and students are all involved equally . We do not agree with a curriculum -LRB- Teen Talk -RRB- that encourages children to go around parents and also gives them unsafe and unhealthy choices like participating in anal sex and sex with multiple partners . There is no safe way to have anal sex and the risk for disease is much greater making it something that we should leave for adults to choose . Teen Talk has multiple links to Planned Parenthood for kids to explore their sexuality and Health Connected has staff members with Planned Parenthood connections . I do not think people want a biased political lobby influencing our Curriculum . What if it was the NRA or a Christian organization for example ? Like them or not Planned Parenthood is a controversial political organization that donates exclusively to one party and they are a business that makes money off the sexualization of young people . Why would Santa Barbara Unified School District and Laura Capps , who also was on Planned Parenthoods Board of Directors , even consider to purchase such a controversial curriculum such as Teen Talk ? Did they know Orange Unified School Board turned it down in 2018 because they found it to be against State Law ? Why would they pay for this curriculum knowing that it will be taken to court by concerned parents ? We have provided the district with and alternative and free curriculum called HEART -LRB- Healthy Education and Relationship Training -RRB- that does fit the AB329 guidelines and does not cross the line sexually . It meets all state requirements but does not have a political or ideological objective . It also tries to include parents in the conversation making the chances for success much better . We can do better if we do not assist in over sexualizing our children and having open conversations about the risks of sex . This also can be an opportunity for parents who do not know how to talk to their kids about this to learn as well . If we can teach kids how life changing having an STD or pregnancy can be at a young age maybe we can stop using abortion as a contraceptive . One of the many petitions against Teen Talk and Supporting the HEART curriculum can be viewed at Change.org and it had over 344 supporters prior to the drafting of this letter . We ask that the district be inclusive of all parents in this decision . We can reverse the STD trends and the amount of teen pregnancies with active parents and teachers educating our youth together as a team .", "url": "https://www.citizensjournal.us/scott-mccann-and-planned-parenthood-do-not-understand-or-choose-to-misrepresent-the-opposition-to-teen-talk-sex-ed/", "kws": ["Planned^^Parenthood", "Teen^^Talk", "abortion", "sex^^education", "Planned^^Parenthood^^connections", "Planned^^Parenthood^^shirts", "Scott^^McCann", "concerned^^parents", "teen^^pregnancies", "Teen", "Planned^^Parenthoods^^Board", "anal^^sex", "NRA", "teachers", "kids", "open^^conversations", "choices", "Peggy^^Wilson", "State^^Law", "Laura^^Capps"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Society": 0.9989479184150696}, "second_cat": {"Society_Other": 0.9989479184150696}}}

Stitt said he is cautiously optimistic that growth of coronavirus in Oklahoma is flattening , pointing toward a decrease in hospitalizations due to COVID-19 this week compared to last . But , the governor said the fiscal outlook for the state is not looking better . A drop in oil prices and the economic shut down brought on by COVID-19 have been a double whammy for the state . On Monday , the state Legislature passed three bills shifting money around to fund state agencies for the rest of the year . However , the governor indicated he might not sign them and that cuts are likely for the final months of this year 's budget and next year 's . `` Asking the state government also to cut expenses by 1 or 2 percent is reasonable in the current situation that we 're in . So we 're talking about agency cuts , '' Stitt said . State legislative leaders from both sides of the aisle quickly rebuffed Stitt 's comments . House Speaker Charles McCall -LRB- R-Atoka -RRB- said the legislature wo n't be changing its mind . `` The state 's reserves , which exist for emergencies just like this , are sufficient for services to continue uninterrupted , '' McCall said . `` The legislative branch controls the power of the purse , and we have made our position clear . '' Senate President Pro Tempore Greg Treat -LRB- R-Oklahoma City -RRB- said the legislature 's goal in passing the three bills was to prevent budget cuts to public schools , health care , first responders and other core state services . `` The legislature is a co-equal branch of government vested with the authority to write the budget . We take that role seriously , '' Treat said . `` I am hopeful that the governor signs all the legislation that was sent to his desk this week . '' Senate Minority Leader Kay Floyd -LRB- D-Oklahoma City -RRB- said state Senate Democrats are disappointed in the governor 's proposal . `` Every day dedicated and hard-working state employees are on the frontlines of Oklahoma 's efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19 , '' Floyd said . `` Now is not the time to be reducing much needed resources for state agencies . '' In a Twitter thread , House Minority Leader Emily Virgin -LRB- D-Norman -RRB- urged Stitt to sign the bills . `` This is not the time to be cutting core services , '' Virgin said . `` More people than ever are depending on these services , and we have a moral responsibility to provide them .

Players would compete at local ballparks then be sequestered at hotels . This would require players to go without being with their families and friends for up to 4\u00a01/2 months . This is a wonderful plan , and it can only get better as more details emerge . For example : Unicorns . A plan this solid must include unicorns . And what about magic ? Could each player be coated with fairy dust to keep him healthy ? And what about doubleheaders ? Would baseball be played before or after the Quidditch matches ? Let 's hope baseball was just spitballing , and that this was more of a discussion point than a plan . Otherwise , baseball will need a new commissioner . COVID-19 is n't just a disease . It 's an intelligence test . If baseball tries this , its entire management team will get a failing grade . Baseball might not resume at all this year , and if it does resume , it wo n't be in May . The NBA is n't going to even hold discussions about resumption until May , which is logical . We 'll know much more about the spread of the virus in the United States by then . The best guess based on current information is that neither the NHL nor NBA will finish its season . Everyone in sports should take the hint that the Masters is dropping . The ol' boys in Augusta are unique in the sports world , in that they do n't need to make a profit on their tournament . Originally scheduled for this week , the Masters has been postponed until mid-November . Given that Augusta National has no scheduling conflicts , and the Masters could have rescheduled for any date it so chose , this is a strong indication of the probable arc of the sports calendar this year . Mid-November is the latest the Masters could be scheduled this year , without fear of colder temperatures that could affect the greens and the quality of play , and mid-November is the date the Masters chose . Those desperate for sports and hopeful that baseball will return in May are ignoring a major factor in leadership : Accountability . Imagine that you 're Commissioner Rob Manfred . You resume play in Phoenix in May . You are the only sport putting its players at risk . A player becomes infected and spreads the virus to his teammates . Someone , maybe even a player , dies . The tainted blood would be on Manfred 's hands . He would bear that blame and burden for the rest of his life . His career will be ruined . All for a chance to play baseball without fans in minor league ballparks . Momentarily considering this plan is fine . Adopting it is unconscionable . There is a new phrase that is ruling sport at the moment , and it is this : We are n't in charge . The virus is in charge . Sport will resume when the virus allows .

Scientists using data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite have noticed a strong reduction of ozone concentrations over the Arctic . Unusual atmospheric conditions , including freezing temperatures in the stratosphere , have led ozone levels to plummet - causing a ` mini-hole ' in the ozone layer . The ozone layer is a natural , protective layer of gas in the stratosphere that shields life from the Sun 's harmful ultraviolet radiation - which is associated with skin cancer and cataracts , as well as other environmental issues . The ` ozone hole ' most commonly referenced is the hole over Antarctica , forming each year during autumn . In the past weeks , scientists from the German Aerospace Center -LRB- DLR -RRB- have noticed the unusually strong depletion of ozone over the northern polar regions . Using data from the Tropomi instrument on the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite , they were able to monitor this Arctic ozone hole form in the atmosphere . In the past , mini ozone holes have occasionally been spotted over the North Pole , but the depletion over the Arctic this year is much larger compared to previous years . Diego Loyola , from the German Aerospace Center , comments , `` The ozone hole we observe over the Arctic this year has a maximum extension of less than 1 million sq km . This is small compared to the Antarctic hole , which can reach a size of around 20 to 25 million sq km with a normal duration of around 3 to 4 months . '' Even though both poles endure ozone losses during winter , the Arctic 's ozone depletion tends to be significantly less than Antarctica . The ozone hole is driven by extremely cold temperatures -LRB- below -80 \u00b0C -RRB- , sunlight , wind fields and substances such as chlorofluorocarbons -LRB- CFCs -RRB- . Arctic temperatures do not usually plummet as low as in Antarctica . However , this year , powerful winds flowing around the North Pole trapped cold air within what is known as the ` polar vortex ' - a circling whirlpool of stratospheric winds . By the end of the polar winter , the first sunlight over the North Pole initiated this unusually strong ozone depletion - causing the hole to form . However , its size is still small compared to what can usually be observed in the southern hemisphere . Diego says , `` Since 14 March , the ozone columns over the Arctic have decreased to what is normally considered ` ozone hole levels , ' which are less than 220 Dobson Units . We expect the hole to close again during mid-April 2020 . '' Claus Zehner , ESA 's Copernicus Sentinel-5P mission manager , adds , `` The Tropomi total ozone measurements are extending Europe 's capability of the continuous global ozone monitoring from space since 1995 . In this time , we have not witnessed an ozone hole formation of this size over the Arctic . '' In the 2018 Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion , data shows that the ozone layer in parts of the stratosphere has recovered at a rate of 1-3 % per decade since 2000 . At these projected rates , the Northern Hemisphere and mid-latitude ozone is predicted to recover by around 2030 , followed by the Southern Hemisphere around 2050 , and polar regions by 2060 . The Tropomi instrument on the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite measures a number of trace gases , including aerosol and cloud properties with a global coverage on a daily basis . Given the importance of monitoring air quality and global ozone distribution , the upcoming Copernicus Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5 missions will monitor key air quality trace gases , stratospheric ozone , and aerosols . As part of the EU 's Copernicus programme , the missions will provide information on air quality , solar radiation and climate monitoring .

In fact , he turned down being in an opening at the Academy Awards because of how they wanted to make a joke about it . In a recent interview with Another Man , Gyllenhaal stated that Ledger refused to present at the Academy Awards in 2007 because of the joke . `` I mean , I remember they wanted to do an opening for the Academy Awards that year that was sort of joking about it , '' he said . `` And Heath refused .

These releases would protect other individuals who sexually abused them , according to a letter from the Attorney General . She made it clear that that her support of a compensation fund `` would allow victims to avoid the publicity and trauma of a trial and provide them , promptly , with a measure of justice and closure . '' Back in January , the Attorney General filed a lawsuit against Epstein 's estate and six other related companies based in the Virgin Islands . The lawsuit claimed the two islands Epstein owned were a haven for the sex trafficking of young women . Court documents alleged he trafficked young women to his islands as recently as 2018 and brought girls as young as 11 years old . One of Epstein 's victims , according to the suit filed in the U.S. Virgin Islands , tried to swim to escape his island . In a letter obtained by CBS12 News Tuesday night , the Attorney General says the current Victim Compensation Fund is a `` substantial improvement '' from the original fund proposed by attorneys for Epstein 's estate . The new victim compensation fund now includes the following : Involvement of victim advocate Marci Hamilton , CEO of Child USA and the country 's preeminent expert and advocate on child sexual abuse issues . This will help ensure that the decisions of the fund administrator are fully informed by and sensitive to the unique experiences and needs of survivors of trafficking and sexual abuse . Dedicated funding to ensure that victims who have not yet come forward or who are not satisfied with the claims process or award can opt-out without sacrificing the chance of a judgment or recovery Protections to ensure that information shared by victims in the claims process is not provided to the estate and potentially used against the claimant or other victims Access to counseling and referral services through the FBI Victim Services program and Child USA Approval of the program 's administrative budget by the Probate Court and monthly reporting to the Attorney General 's Office and the Probate Court on the number and value of claim awards . The Attorney General is asking that the Probate Court `` determine whether to approve the required release of independently culpable third parties . '' The Attorney General acknowledges the tremendous bravery and strength of the women who have come forward to work with the Attorney General 's Office on this process and is hopeful that the fund will be able to proceed fairly and successfully .

She watches me like a hawk to be sure I wash my hands after getting the mail , monitors how much news I watch -LRB- so I do n't get depressed -RRB- , and urges me to get enough exercise . I 'm on a pretty short leash . Actually , when it comes to exercise , I need to be on a very long leash because when we go for our daily brisk walk , Mary Ellen walks faster than I do . Much faster . I had n't thought much about this before the current crisis , but I 've always known she was a fast walker . Come to think of it , if I had n't broken into a full gallop down the aisle the day we got married , she 'd have beaten me to the altar by several noses . There 's a somewhat demeaning aspect in this shared workout . When we take a walk around the block , I sometimes ask Mary Ellen to loop back and around me so she does n't get too far ahead . A grown man should not be yelling to his wife , `` Wait up ! '' an expression I have n't used since junior high school . Sometimes when she gets way in front , I hide behind a shrub to see if she 'll turn around to see where I am . This is not a good idea . In a neighborhood with small children , lurking behind foliage is frowned upon . What makes this so humiliating is that I have always been a good athlete . I played center field on my high school baseball team and also ran track . I prided myself on my speed . One thing was sure : I never had anything to do with girls who were fast . Hmmm ... I probably should rewrite that sentence . My wife is not an athlete and never claimed to be . When Mary Ellen runs , she does n't even bend her legs at the knees . She looks a recruit in the Third Reich . So I ca n't figure out how she walks faster . Let 's see ... her legs are longer than mine . And wait , she moves them back and forth faster than I do . Okay , I just figured it out . But it does n't make me feel any better . The great irony in this is that one of the reasons I was attracted to my wife 41 years ago was her long , slender legs . This is exactly how men get themselves in trouble . When I saw those lovely limbs , my mind turned to romance , but I should have realized she 'd be walking ahead of me for the next several decades . I knew I was marrying a woman who was smarter . But faster ? That was n't the plan . This past week , we decided to split up so I would n't slow her down . Now we go in opposite directions around our block . It 's great . No matter how leisurely I walk , we pass each other at exactly the same time . I know that was an incredibly stupid thing to say . But do n't try to explain it to me . It should be obvious how slow I am . Dick Wolfsie has been a reporter for WISH-TV in Indianapolis the past 30 years .

A myriad of U.S. based brands released high-powered , stylish machines , most of which demonstrated poor handling characteristics through curves , but were unbeatable in a straight line . Throughout automobile history , the big three American car manufacturers , General Motors , Ford , and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles -LRB- FCA -RRB- have introduced special editions of their muscle car offerings . These models offered more power and performance than the so-called standard muscle cars , and they were often produced in limited numbers . Modern muscle cars produce 500 to 700 horsepower plus , and are far superior to their '60s and '70s ancestors that typically generated 300 to 350 hp . However , the iconic muscle cars , rolling pieces of Americana , are still held in high regard and sought after by collectors . Furthermore , the vintage special edition models are even more desirable and fetch higher prices . Here are twenty of the sickest special edition muscle cars of all time . 20 2018 Corvette Z06 With Z07 Option The `` Big Nasty '' Corvette Z06 boasted an LT4 supercharged 6.2-liter V8 power plant producing 650 horsepower , the most powerful engine ever installed in a production `` Vette . '' The Z07 high-performance package included adjustable front and rear aerodynamic components for exceptional downforce , Brembo carbon ceramic-matrix brake rotors , and Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires for enhanced grip . Performance improvements gave the sports car an acceleration from 0 to 60 mph in a mere 2.95 seconds . 19 2017 Cadillac CTS-V With Hennessey Performance Through the years , Cadillac has built a reputation as American 's premier luxury car brand , but the CTS-V is the muscle car version . The supercharged 6.2-liter V8 engine generates a whopping 640 hp , with a 0-60 mph time of 3.7 seconds . Add the Hennessey Performance package , and the output is boosted to mind-boggling 1,000 hp and the 0-60 mph time dropped to 2.9 seconds . The quarter-mile time is a mere 10.5 seconds , and the top speed exceeds 220 mph . 18 1971 Ford Torino GT Convertible When Ford introduced the Torino GT in 1968 , several engine options were offered : 289 , 302 , and 390 cubic inch models . In 1971 , a special edition with the 429 Cobra Jet and Ram-Air option producing 375 horsepower replaced the 390 . Over the course of four years , only 13,234 Ford Torino GT convertibles were made . Low production numbers and severe rust issues that plagued the Torino have made the GT Convertible a rare sight on the roads today . 17\u00a01967-1970 Dodge Coronet R/T Convertible HEMI The special edition Coronet R/T was introduced in 1967 and produced until 1970 . Dodge offered two engine options , the standard 440 cu in Magnum V8 and the 426 cu in HEMI . The Magnum produced 375 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque while the HEMI generated 425 hp and 490 lb.-ft . of torque . Dodge manufactured 29,957 Coronet R/Ts during the four-year run , but the Convertible/Hemi combo was so rare only 24 were produced . 16 1971 Baldwin-Motion Phase III GT Corvette A collaboration between Motion Performance and Long Island car dealer , Baldwin Chevrolet , the ultra-elite GT Corvettes with 454 LS6 big-block engines producing 500 hp , were only made from 1969 to 1971 before the U.S. Justice Department ended the operation . The government threatened fines as high as $ 10,000 to $ 50,000 per car for the removal of anti-smog devices . Motion Performance negotiated an agreement to pay a $ 500 fine and to `` cease and desist '' producing new Baldwin-Motion high-performance cars . 15 1973 AMC Javelin Highway Patrol Car Any car equipped for use as a police vehicle , by default , is a special edition . The Javelin was the first-ever muscle car put into service by the American highway patrol and other law enforcement agencies . Offered in several variations from the factory , the AMC was also victorious at the \u201971 and \u201972 Trans-Am race series . 14 2018 Camaro ZL1 1LE The 1LE is distinguished from the already high-performance Camaro ZL1 muscle car by the addition of several features : a unique racing-based suspension includes DSSV shocks , a carbon-fiber wing fitted to the rear , and extra-wide Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar 3R treads . The weight is reduced by 60 pounds with lighter wheels and dampers , thinner glass in the rear , and a fixed-back rear seat . The 1LE is the quickest Camaro ever to lap the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife . 13 1970 Buick Skylark GSX Stage 1 Buick built the special edition Skylark GSX with a focus on the track . An upgrade of the more than competent GS 455 , Motor Trend described the muscle car as `` the quickest American production we had ever tested . '' Only 687 Stage 1 Skylark GSXs were produced . The special edition boasted upgraded components under the hood , as well as several aerodynamic tweaks that reduced the drag coefficient . 12 1970 Plymouth Hemi Superbird The 1970 Plymouth Hemi Superbird had a horn that imitated the `` beep beep '' sound produced by the Looney Tunes ' Roadrunner cartoon character . However , the horn was not the only feature that made the Superbird unique . Modeled after the Dodge Charger Daytona , the Plymouth was equipped with 426 cubic inch HEMI and high-performance components . Only 135 of the muscle cars were produced in 1970 , but it became well-known for its high mounted spoiler that looked like a wing . 11 2017 Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 And GT350R The Shelby has always been a special edition Mustang and its history goes back as far as 1965 . For 2017 , two versions were offered , the GT350 and the track-focused GT350R . Both are fitted with a 5.2 L flat-plane crank V8 engine producing 526 hp and 429 lb-ft of torque , mated to a 6-speed TREMEC manual transmission . The GT350R reaches 60 mph in 3.9 seconds and uses Brembo brakes to slow back down to zero mph . 10 2017 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat The special edition Charger SRT Hellcat is a beast producing 707 horsepower from its supercharged 6.2-liter HEMI V8 . However , for those hardcore HEMI fanatics not satisfied with the base-model horsepower , the Hennessey Performance package offers an HPE1000 Supercharged Upgrade . Power output is increased to 1,012 hp , allowing the Hellcat to accelerate from 0-60 mph in a mere 2.8 seconds and reach the quarter-mile in a blistering 9.9 seconds . 9 1969 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 The ZL1 was equipped with a unique -LRB- at the time -RRB- L88 aluminum engine that weighed only 500 pounds and produced a factory-rated 430 horsepower . Only 69 of the special edition Camaro ZL-1s were manufactured in 1969 . The low numbers were attributed to the car 's high price tag of $ 7,200 . The first twenty cars were sold to professional drag racing teams , and the remainder offered to the public . However , 12 of the vehicles were sent back to the factory to be fitted with smaller engines , making them more affordable . 8 2017 Ford Mustang RTR Ford designed the Mustang RTR with the younger generation of muscle car enthusiasts in mind with LED grille lighting and lowering springs , offering the muscle car in three trim levels . Spec 1 GTs deliver 435 hp while Spec 2 trims add sway bars , adjustable shocks and struts , and a back axle performance calibrated exhaust . The Spec 3 RTR features a Ford Performance supercharger and intercooler cranking out a whopping 670 hp . 7 1964 Ford Galaxie 427 SOHC The Galaxie was the flagship model in Ford 's lineup for 1964 and considered by most to be a family car . However , one special edition equipped with a 427 SOHC 7.0 L V8 engine , also known as a `` Cammer , '' was one of the most powerful muscle cars of the ` 60s and ` 70s golden age . Producing 657 horsepower , NASCAR banned it from the competitions . 6 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon The Challenger SRT Demon is an exceptional special edition muscle car in its own right , but add the optional Demon Crate kit , and the power bumps up to 840 hp . The result is a quarter-mile time of just 9.65 seconds and the world 's fastest -LRB- according to Dodge -RRB- 0-60 mph time of 2.3 seconds . 5 2017 Ford Mustang Roush P-51 The price of a Mustang Roush P-51 is $ 42,500 more than the Mustang GT , but the additional power is worth the extra bucks . Roush Performance company claimed the P-51 was `` the most powerful American pre-titled car ever built '' -LRB- before the release of the Dodge Demon -RRB- . The Roush Eaton TVS supercharged Coyote 5.0-liter V8 generates 727 hp , with the aid of an active exhaust system . The P-51 is also fitted with Amaretto Tuscany leather , which has no impact on performance but makes the driver and passengers feel comfortable . 4 1969-1970 Mercury Cougar Eliminator Poor sales of the stock Cougar in its third year of production inspired Mercury to build a special edition like no other . The Eliminator was offered with several engine options , but the 390 with a 4-barrel carburetor was the most powerful delivering 320 horsepower . Mercury sold a total of 2,250 Eliminators in 1969 and 2,267 cars in 1970 equipped with a new 300-hp 351 cu in Cleveland V8 . 3 1971 Pontiac Firebird Formula 400 The Firebird Formula 400 was a sleeper in 1971 , primarily for two reasons . First , it had fierce competition from its closest sibling , the Trans AM . Second , the Ram Air IV engine option was not well promoted by Pontiac . The powerful upgrade was only advertised in a GTO brochure . The Ram Air III L74 HO version of the 400 cu in L78 V8 produced 335 hp . 2 1971 Plymouth Hemi Cuda Convertible The HEMI Cuda is arguably one of the best muscle cars ever produced . Five different engine options were offered with the Plymouth , the rarest being the 426 cubic inch HEMI . The Cudas were the only Plymouths available with HEMI engines from 1970 to 1971 . Just twenty-one Convertibles were produced , most likely because the engine upgrade cost $ 871 . 1 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 454 LS6 The old adage , `` there 's no replacement for displacement , '' originated with ` 60s muscle cars and was still valid in the ` 70s . Chevrolet believed in the axiom , equipping the 1970 Chevelle SS with the most powerful engine available , the 560 horsepower 440 cubic inch LS6 . The Chevelle was offered with a four-speed or automatic . The LS6 mated to either transmission in the Chevelle is a rare find today .

He was , as one of his songs put it , the bard of `` broken hearts and dirty windows . '' A onetime Army mechanic and mail carrier who wrote songs rooted in the experiences of lower-middle-class life , Mr. Prine rose to prominence almost by accident . He was at a Chicago folk club called the Fifth Peg one night in 1969 , complaining about the performers , when someone challenged him to get onstage , saying , `` You get up and try . '' Emboldened by a few beers , he picked up his guitar and sang three of his original songs . Within a year , he released his first album and was hailed as one of the foremost lyricists of his time , an heir to Bob Dylan . He would end up recording more than 20 albums , win three Grammy Awards , and help define a genre of music that came to be called Americana . He was a significant influence on a younger generation of singer-songwriters , including Kacey Musgraves , Jason Isbell , and the Black Keys ' Dan Auerbach , who called him `` the closest thing I could imagine to ever being around Mark Twain . '' Mr. Prine , 73 , has died after being hospitalized in Nashville of complications from the novel coronavirus , the media relations family Sacks & Co. said on behalf of his family . He overcame throat cancer in the 1990s and lung cancer in 2013 . The three tunes Mr. Prine sang at his debut performance in Chicago were written during his breaks while delivering mail . All became classics in the singer-songwriter tradition : `` Sam Stone , '' about a Vietnam vet returning home with a drug habit ; `` Hello in There , '' about the emotional loneliness of older people ; and `` Paradise , '' an autobiographical lament about his family 's Kentucky hometown , plowed under to make way for strip mines . Not long after he received a glowing review from Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert , Mr. Prine quit his job with the Postal Service . His supervisor told him , `` You 'll be back . '' His songs about blue-collar woes and hard-luck lives soon attracted a devoted following , which included Dylan , who described Mr. Prine 's work as `` pure Proustian existentialism . Midwestern mindtrips to the nth degree . And he writes beautiful songs . '' When Mr. Prine was a 24-year-old mail carrier , he received a career boost from his friend Steve Goodman , a Chicago musician who wrote `` The City of New Orleans . '' Goodman persuaded singer , songwriter , and actor Kris Kristofferson to listen to Mr. Prine after hours at a Chicago club . After listening to about seven songs , Kristofferson asked Mr. Prine to play them all again . `` He was unlike anybody I 'd ever seen -- such a young kid , and yet he 's writing songs like ` Hello in There , ' `` Kristofferson told The Washington Post in 2005 . `` John was singing some of the best songs I 've ever heard , and they still are the best songs I 've ever heard . '' In `` Hello in There , '' an old man reflects on his life and its litany of sorrows : `` We lost Davy in the Korean War , and I still do n't know what for , it do n't matter anymore . '' In the song 's chorus , he sings , `` Old people just grow lonesome / Waiting for someone to say , ` Hello in there , hello . '' ' From the beginning , he combined pathos and humor , the lyrical and the satirical . One of his more high-spirited tunes , `` Illegal Smile , '' was interpreted as a nod to marijuana . Another was a spoof of the letters to advice columnist Abigail Van Buren : `` Dear Abby , Dear Abby ... My fountain pen leaks , My wife hollers at me and my kids are all freaks . Every side I get up on is the wrong side of bed , If it were n't so expensive , I 'd wish I were dead . Signed , Unhappy . '' `` He is a truly original writer , unequaled , and a genuine poet of the American people , '' Ted Kooser , the 2005 poet laureate of the United States , said . `` He did a better job of holding up the mirror of art to the ` 60s and ` 70s than any of our official literary poets . And none of our poets wrote anything better about Vietnam than Prine 's ` Sam Stone . ' `` `` Sam Stone '' is a chilling ballad about a wounded veteran with the gravity of a three-act play . Mr. Prine describes the vet coming home `` with a Purple Heart and a monkey on his back '' and how `` the morphine eased the pain '' of his physical and psychic wounds . A recurring chorus suggests the poignant view of a child growing up too soon : `` There 's a hole in Daddy 's arm where all the money goes . Jesus Christ died for nothin , ' I suppose . '' Some listeners were offended by the invocation of Jesus in a song about drug addiction , but Mr. Prine said he was `` just trying to think of something as hopeless '' as a Vietnam vet succumbing to his private demons . `` You write a song about something that you think might be taboo , '' he told Rolling Stone , `` you sing it for other people and they immediately recognize themselves in it . '' His 1971 debut album , titled simply `` John Prine , '' received strong reviews -- `` he squeezes poetry out of the anguished longing of empty lives , '' a Time magazine critic wrote -- but modest sales . Other performers recognized his talent , however , and Bette Midler and Joan Baez both recorded `` Hello in There . '' The Everly Brothers did a version of `` Paradise , '' and Johnny Cash sang `` Sam Stone '' -LRB- omitting the line about Jesus -RRB- . Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty did background vocals for Mr. Prine 's 1992 album `` The Missing Years , '' and Bonnie Raitt and Susan Tedeschi had memorable interpretations of `` Angel From Montgomery , '' which Mr. Prine wrote from the perspective of a woman regretting the missed opportunities in life . His unadorned melodies were effective vehicles for introspective lyrics drawn from everyday sources . A haunting line from `` Sam Stone '' -- `` Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios '' -- was inspired by an Army buddy whose radio was held together with electrical tape . When he wrote `` Ai n't it funny how an old broken bottle looks just like a diamond ring ? '' for the 1971 song `` Far From Me , '' Mr. Prine said he recalled an image from childhood of broken glass sparkling in the city dump near his house . `` I do n't know of a better thing to follow as a writer than what your gut instinct tells you , '' he said . `` That 's where everything springs from . '' Mr. Prine 's first two marriages , to Ann Carole Menaloscino and musician Rachel Peer , ended in divorce . -LRB- `` Divorces have a way of turning into memorable songs for me , '' he said . -RRB- In 1993 , he married Fiona Whelan , who became his manager . They had two sons , and he adopted her son . Fiona Prine said she also contracted the coronavirus . A complete list of survivors was not immediately available . In 2018 , Mr. Prine released his first album of new music in 13 years . The 10 songs on `` The Tree of Forgiveness '' -LRB- some written with collaborators -RRB- showed the same blend of humor , sorrow , and outrage . The album reached No. 2 on the Billboard country chart and No. 5 on the pop chart , giving the 72-year-old Prine the biggest hit record of his career .", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/obituaries/2020/04/07/john-prine-grammy-winning-bard-broken-hearts-and-dirty-windows-dies-coronavirus/quT0V5FC30E2TFI5cDQyON/story.html", "kws": ["John^^Prine", "Mr.^^Prine", "Fiona^^Prine", "memorable^^songs", "beautiful^^songs", "introspective^^lyrics", "songwriter", "Sweet^^songs", "poetry", "classics", "soul", "music", "humor", "Americana", "Bruce^^Springsteen", "memorable^^interpretations", "singer-songwriters", "Bob^^Dylan", "Mark^^Twain", "Joan^^Baez"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Music": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Music_Other": 1.0000100135803223}}}

' But curves might be flattening .", "content": "Pennsylvania , New Jersey , and the region reached new highs with their daily reports of coronavirus deaths on Tuesday ; the Garden State closed its parks ; and Philadelphia warned of impending `` painful '' cuts while imploring religious leaders to hold only virtual services during the coming holy days . Those bleak developments notwithstanding , officials were continuing to see budding , if not quite blooming , signs for optimism that the virus and its insidious siege of anxiety eventually will relent . While the numbers keep climbing on both sides of the river -- up to 240 virus-related deaths in Pennsylvania and 1,232 in New Jersey , including 191 in Philadelphia and its neighboring counties -- the case curves have been flattening in both states , which officials attribute to social distancing practices . Nine have died in New Castle County . Gov. Phil Murphy said he had spoken with Pennsylvania 's Tom Wolf and other governors about preliminary plans for a slow return to business . But he also indicated that the suspension of business as usual will be the routine for a while longer . The Inquirer Coronavirus Newsletter Science-based coverage sent daily to your inbox -- all facts , no panic `` We must not just flatten this curve , '' he said . `` We must crush this curve . '' He said his state was n't out of the woods yet , and that is why he closed them : He ordered all state forests and state and county parks shut indefinitely . `` We are seeing far too many instances of people gathering in groups in our parks erroneously thinking that since they 're outside , social distancing does n't matter , '' he said . `` Nothing could be further from the truth . '' New Jersey also announced it was postponing its primary election , scheduled for June 2 , to July 7 . And Murphy stopped just short of saying that families can forget about graduation ceremonies . `` In my shoes , you would n't be dealing with the facts if I were to say publicly right now you should feel OK about a late May , early June graduation celebration , '' he said . New Jersey on Tuesday reported 232 new coronavirus deaths , the highest of any of its daily reports , although it was unclear when the deaths had occurred . Pennsylvania reported 78 , also the highest total in a daily update . The states ' numbers include 47 in the eight-county Philadelphia region , another daily high . New Jersey 's case count rose above 44,000 , and Pennsylvania 's approached 15,000 . However , they have not been doubling every one to two days , as they were last week . While the numbers of cases might drop off , said Thomas W. Farley , Philadelphia 's health commissioner , `` the number of deaths will probably continue to rise over the next few days to a couple of weeks . '' One disturbing trend has been `` significant increases '' in the number of Pennsylvania nursing homes and long-term care centers that have reported at least one positive case of the coronavirus , state officials said . But Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine said she did n't have detailed data . In Philadelphia , more than 45 firefighters and paramedics have tested positive for the virus , according to department sources , and about 140 firefighters and paramedics are still awaiting test results . The Fire Department has 2,700 firefighters and medics . SEPTA , which has lost three employees to the coronavirus , is dramatically slashing service and as of Thursday will institute a `` lifeline service schedule . '' It will be closing subway stations , limiting bus and trolley service , and suspending some Regional Rail lines . `` If you do n't need to be out on the system , I 'm begging you , please stay off the system , '' said Fran Kelly , SEPTA assistant general manager for public and government affairs . Realistically , people simply do n't have many places to go with so many businesses and institutions shut down because of the pandemic . And the fallout has hit the city 's tax coffers profoundly . Mayor Jim Kenney said Tuesday that the city stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars , forcing severe budget cuts and service reductions . He said the losses would force the city to make decisions `` the likes of which have never been needed . `` To what degree , we do n't yet know , '' he said at a news conference . `` But it will affect things that people care about and expect from their city government . I know full well that any reductions in city services will be painful . '' Kenney will scrap the $ 5.2 billion spending plan that he proposed to City Council in March for the coming fiscal year , and will present a new budget plan to Council on May 1 . An analysis by the Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority -LRB- PICA -RRB- found that the city could lose up to $ 400 million in revenue in the current quarter , which ends June 30 . Not surprisingly , Americans ' outlook on health and the economy has taken a steep downturn in recent weeks . The survey of 1 , people found just under 40 % losing work or income because of the coronavirus . Anxiety of affording health care increased , along with mental-health problems . That said , the poll found a sharp increase in the number of people who are taking recommended precautions to protect against contracting the virus . More than 90 % of respondents said they are taking measures such as canceling travel plans , skipping group events , and staying home from work . That has been quite evident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike , where traffic has dropped 76.5 % since residents were told to stay home and commercial vehicle traffic has decreased by 27.5 % , state police said , adding that Pennsylvanians are `` getting the message '' on social distancing . '' ASK US : Do you have a question about the coronavirus and how it affects your health , work and life ? Ask our reporters . `` The mitigation strategies we believe are beginning to work , '' Lt. Col. Scott Price told reporters on a phone call . And Pennsylvania anglers received some good news Tuesday with the announcement that trout season had begun , almost two weeks earlier than scheduled . The state said it moved up the date to discourage a concentration of people gathering on its traditional opening day , to minimize travel , and to reduce the threat of illegal poaching in waters that have already been stocked . The state suggests wearing face masks , keeping at least six feet away from other anglers , and not sharing fishing gear . The coronavirus has not deterred the Easter Bunny , a.k.a. Aaron Talasnik , 42 , who wears a bunny costume while walking dog Charlie in Center City . `` I think a lot of people right now are struggling , '' he said . `` I ca n't afford to help financially , and I am not a doctor or nurse . I see this as a way to brighten people 's day .

In a post about the update , the platform says this move has been in the works for a while , and is `` a team effort with months of work . '' It does indicate , however , that it 's rolling out the changes at this precise moment because of the major uptick in traffic it -LRB- along with other social sites like YouTube , Facebook , and Instagram -RRB- has experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic . `` We felt it was important to share this now , as many new faces are joining Twitch , so that all creators have the information they need to create their content , '' Twitch writes . In the past , Twitch has banned numerous streamers for wearing `` suggestive '' attire or appearing on streams nude -LRB- in some cases accidentally , creators claim -RRB- . Prior to today 's changes , Twitch 's longstanding Nudity and Attire policy was two vague paragraphs . It told streamers to wear clothes that are `` appropriate public attire , '' and blanket barred nudity , `` attire intended to be sexually suggestive , '' along with `` undergarments , intimate apparel , or exposing/focusing on male or female genitals , buttocks , or nipples . '' Its new policy moves away from specifying appropriate attire . The rules are now `` based on a standard level of coverage . '' Creators -LRB- of any sex or gender -RRB- still may not broadcast nude or partially nude , and all streamers `` must cover the area extending from your hips to the bottom of your pelvis and buttocks , '' Twitch says . Women , however , do have a few guidelines specific to them . Twitch asks that they cover their nipples , and bans `` exposed underbust . '' It also -- for the first time -- officially rules that `` cleavage is unrestricted as long as these coverage requirements are met . '' Creators previously punished for Nudity/Attire violations wo n't have their cases reevaluated -- at least for now As for situational exceptions , Twitch says creators wo n't face penalties in a few special scenarios . Those include beach trips -LRB- streamers can wear your average swimsuit , they just ca n't show genitals and women must cover their nipples -RRB- , body art like painting or tattooing -LRB- coverage is still required , but showing more skin is allowed -RRB- , and breastfeeding -LRB- streamers do not have to meet the chest coverage requirements if they 're actively feeding a kiddo -RRB- . Twitch also wo n't ban creators if they 're streaming at a public event like a music festival and happen to catch footage of a passerby who 's nude -- so long as they `` take immediate action , remove the content , and take precautionary steps so it wo n't happen again . '' If streamers do n't take action and/or remove the content , they 'll be punished as if they were the one violating the rules , Twitch adds . This policy is effective immediately , with no grace period for creators ' new content . Old content that might violate new guidelines should be removed by May 1 . And if you 're wondering about creators who were previously suspended or banned for doing something that 's now allowed -LRB- such as showing cleavage -RRB- , they 're out of luck . In an FAQ about the update , Twitch says those streamers ' content may not violate the new rules , but it violated the old ones when they were in place , and `` at this time , '' punishments for that will not be reevaluated .

0.0	{"docid": "0Ogjoadi", "title": "Why Brazil will likely not `` emerge , '' but may still offer select investment opportunities", "content": "Oh , Brazil ! What ails thee ? We have not been convinced of any scenario in which Brazil emerges as a growth economy . We believe it simply has too many self-inflicted impediments to support material structural growth . There are always cyclical swings and in Brazil -- as an example of what we call the Latin American funk -- these swings are volatile , brief and brutal . Nevertheless , we believe there is a very strong investment case for investing in a handful of structurally advantaged companies in Brazil . In a market characterized by extreme excesses , prices on offer today represent terrific value . I . The Case for Investing in Brazil amid this crisis Brazil was truly the poster child of the `` emerging market century . '' The widely touted view - -- amplified for a few years after the 2007-2008 global financial crisis -- was that the developing world would be the dominant global growth engine , with larger emerging market -LRB- EM -RRB- economies converging toward G-7 income and productivity levels . While we are critical of this view as heuristically na\u00efve , as we explain in greater depth in `` False narratives : The myth of ` superior ' emerging market growth , `` we have explained at length why superior economic growth is not a necessary premise for unearthing compelling investment opportunities in and around the developing economies . Figure 1 : Brazil market capitalization , in billions of US dollars In our view , Brazil is clearly one of those economies that offers what we consider to be inferior structural macroeconomic growth , but it still has some potentially spectacular investment opportunities . Despite Brazil 's being the third-largest EM economy , its growth in the past decade was meager . On a compound annual growth rate -LRB- CAGR -RRB- basis , it retreated by close to 2 % . As for its capital market , the Brazilian stock exchange 's total market capitalization has yet to rebound to the historical peak of the US$ 1.5 trillion it achieved in 20101 . Beset by the coronavirus outbreak , returns of Brazilian equities have contracted by 54 % since the beginning of the year , compared with the 25 % retreat of the broad MSCI EM Index during the same period .2 In the past decade , while emerging markets saw a narrow 7 % rise in returns , Brazil 's equities took the hardest hit by sinking more than 50 % . The trick in Brazil is timing -- and timing is all about appropriate prices . Figures 2-3 : Brazil historically has consistently underperformed broader EM equity markets II . Self-inflicted ailments What ails Brazil ? The list is lengthy , but fundamentally we believe these are the most notable self-inflicted inhibitors to more sustainable and higher levels of growth in Brazil . Figure 4 : Brazil 's growth lagged all major EM peers over the past decade 1 . Private Investment/Productivity . Investments accounted for only 15 % of Brazil 's GDP in 2019 , around the same level of the past four years . Foremost , growth suffers the most from unreasonably low levels of private investment . Brazil 's private investment has remained , for decades , at levels unable to beat back economic asset depreciation and support sustainable growth . In all developing economies , private investment is the lubricant to income growth , both directly and through productivity improvements . Figure 5 : Investment rates in Brazil remained uninspiring in the past decade . 2 . Fiscal Challenge . Brazil struggles with an outsized state , and one that spends in what we believe are all the wrong places . Brazil 's clumsy state and prohibitive cost of capital have been crowding out private investment for years . At 38 % of GDP ,3 Brazil 's fiscal expenditures topped all major EM countries in 2019 , while its private capital investment has been steadily falling in the past decade , hovering around 15 % of GDP4 in 2018 . Figure 6-7 : Brazil has one of the highest fiscal expenditures among the emerging markets Ever since President Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration 's passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Law in 2000 , Brazil has been preoccupied with taming fiscal expenditures . After recklessness during the Dilma Rousseff administration , there have been notable legislative efforts to return Brazil to fiscal sustainability . Markets cheered both the impeachment of President Rousseff in 2017 and the hard-won passage of social security reform in 2019 . Social security reform which , alongside caps on real budgetary growth over the next 15 years , was estimated to help Brazil onto a path to debt sustainability . However , the cyclical budgetary requirements of the coronavirus and the political inability to enact more material cuts in civil servant wages -LRB- which account for 13 % of total fiscal spending5 -RRB- mean that the outsized fiscal deficit will continue to crowd out private sector investment . 3 . Despite a big state presence , Brazil has been spending in the wrong places . Brazil has only about 42 % of its GDP in government capital stock , well below China 's level -LRB- 165 % -RRB- and that of most of its other EM peers . -LRB- Figure 8 -RRB- Brazil also has one of the lowest levels of infrastructure investment , which is crucial for eliminating production bottlenecks and expanding access to social services . Specifically , Brazil has invested less than 2 % of its GDP over the past two decades in infrastructure , while the rest of Latin America spent 5 % , on average , and the other EM countries devoted more than 6 % of their GDP . A recent survey6 found the Brazilian population to be the most dissatisfied with their infrastructure services among all of the 28 major economies covered in the study . Figure 8 : Brazil 's government capital stock to GDP ratio has lagged most EM peers 4 . Rent seeking and state directed capital allocation . Big government extends beyond the budget in Brazil . The influence of the leviathan is nearly everywhere , creating distortions in capital allocation . Brazil maintains direct ownership of many of the pillars of industry -LRB- Petrobras , Eletrobras , etc. -RRB- and much of the banking industry , including control of giants Banco do Brasil , Caixa , and the Brazilian Development Bank -LRB- BNDS -RRB- . Although there has been a retreat post-impeachment of President Rousseff , public sector credit still represents 47 % of total bank credit .6 And the state 's power to influence capital allocation runs far deeper than its direct intermediation . Private-sector banks -LRB- including foreign-owned banks -RRB- , which currently contribute to about 53 % of national loans , must comply with directed -LRB- `` earmarked '' -RRB- lending requirements , which represent nearly 30 % of total private-sector bank lending .7 Figure 9 : Brazil 's loan market breakdown 5 . Brazil is also notorious for its unusual level of administrative complexity , including one the most challenging tax systems of any significant economy in the world , featuring more than 80 different taxes at the federal , state and municipal levels . All of these forces amplify the problem for the private sector and result in corporate incentives focused as much on rent-seeking concessions as on market-driven competitiveness . It is a testament to the leviathan power that Brazil has such limited competition in product markets and thereby structurally low levels of productivity and innovation . 6 . The dual economy/inequality nexus . Just like India -- as we noted previously in `` India is not the next China '' -- Brazil has a pronounced dual economy , perpetuated by extremely unequal income distribution . The state 's hefty tax revenues amount to as much as a third of its GDP ,8 a level similar to that of European welfare states . But unlike in Europe , where taxes and wealth transfers greatly reduce inequality , Brazil 's distorted social spending exacerbates the dual-economy circumstance . The imbalance is epitomized by the country 's problematic distribution of healthcare and education resources . Specifically , Brazil 's total expenses associated with healthcare added up to 8 % of its national expenditures ,9 or 12 % of GDP in 2016,10 above the global average of 10 % . However , its private sector health care , which stands as the second largest in the world after the US ,11 and accounts for 2/3 of Brazil 's total health expenditures ,12 is available to only 20 % of the Brazilian population . In turn , the remaining population is left to suffer because of insufficient public sector disbursement . Education is the other widely recognized structural problem in Brazil , and it is also a derivative of the country 's dual-economy structure . A typical Brazilian student spends less than 8 years at school , compared to the 8.5-year average across Latin America .13 Brazil 's education expense is overwhelmingly skewed towards tertiary education with strong `` meritocratic '' public universities , which are free and are populated by the upper middle class and the wealthy . On the other hand , the poor are relegated to private universities with not only lower quality but also expensive tuitions . Figure 10 : Social security and payrolls accounted for over 70 % of Brazil 's national expenses in 2018 7 . Brazil 's socioeconomic inequality has also decimated its growth momentum . While income inequality across Latin America fell partly as a result of labor market shifts , inequality in Brazil has been rising since 2014 , with Gini coefficient/index hitting 0.54 as of 2018 . Although by some definition more than half of Brazil 's population is considered middle class ,14 the richest 10 % of Brazilians control about 55 % of national wealth , and the top 1 % own 28 % .15 In recent years , inequalities are further aggravated by President Jair Bolsonaro 's slashing of its landmark poverty reduction program Bolsa Familia , which has never cost the government more than 0.5 % of GDP since its creation in 2003 and helped alleviate poverty for 13.5 million families through conditional cash transferring .16 Figure 11 : Gini index across emerging markets 8 . The closed continental economy . A final noteworthy problem in Brazil is its deliberate insularity from global competition . Brazil has been designed -- since the military dictatorship in the 1960s -- as an import substitution economy . After decades of this experiment , the population has been left with protected industries -LRB- capital equipment , automobiles , white goods -RRB- that amplify inequality and comparatively high price , low-quality products . There is an enormous opportunity for this continental sized economy to open up and receive much needed foreign direct investment . Figure 12 : Brazil is one of the most closed economies in the world III . The Opportunities for Brazil As a result of all this , we believe that Brazil will likely continue to suffer from self-inflicted obstacles to growth and progress . Nevertheless , there remains hope . The President 's cabinet -- and in particular the very capable Minister of Finance , Paulo Guedes -- has a very ambitious program of structural reforms intended to address many of the most pressing obstacles outlined above , including deepening fiscal responsibility -LRB- with durable cuts to public sector wage expansion -RRB- , tax reform , privatization of non-core state assets , and ultimately opening up Brazil 's hermetically sealed economy to greater foreign competition and investment . We believe it is unlikely that the most ambitious parts of this program will get enacted , given the current focus on battling the coronavirus , as well as the lingering political opposition to such deep-seated reform because vested interests are particularly against wholesale tax and administrative reforms . But , as noted , we still believe there remains some hope . It is a powerful observation that the only time real structural change happens is when there is a moment of crisis , when the alternatives are limited and the pressure most intense . Brazil is one of these periods , coming after a long and extremely painful recession over the past half-decade . We expect more to come . Still , we do not invest in hope , but rather from the result of reasoned analysis . Even in the absence of further reform , Brazilian equities are remarkably cheap , in our view . While Brazil will not be able to escape the `` gap '' year in growth and corporate earnings that this dreaded virus has thrust upon all global equities , there will eventually be a recovery . And the survivors -- those with ample balance sheet capacity to invest in brands , channels , capacity and innovation -- will win even more materially as competitors exit or fade into greater obscurity . In addition to Brazil 's having attractive equity valuations , its currency is near rock bottom , in our view . The Brazilian real has fallen sharply this year -LRB- -30 % YTD17 -RRB- , compounding the close to 70 % decline in the past five years . Against the favorable environment of structurally lower interest rates in Brazil , stocks look broadly attractive . Figure 13 : Brazilian Real vs other EM currencies -LRB- by commodity exporters vs. manufacturing countries -RRB- Ultimately , we are investors in what we consider to be great companies and not really countries . Opportunities in Brazil include companies like Lojas Americanas , the omnichannel discretionary retail giant , and B3 , the vertically integrated futures and cash exchange monopoly . We believe both have significant real options , embedded in their already powerful businesses , that are unappreciated , particularly at these valuations . We believe that sustainably advantaged Brazilian leaders in food retail -LRB- Atacadao -RRB- and iron ore -LRB- Vale -RRB- also present opportunities . We believe that valuations are a key component of returns and this crisis has afforded investors an opportunity to find attractively valued companies , including : Itau , the largest private sector bank ; PagSeguro Digital , a leading fintech company ; and AmBev , the Pan-American beer behemoth . While Brazil may likely continue to disappoint the optimists , we do not think its equities will disappoint the cautious .

Gillum , the state 's first black nominee for governor , lost by fewer than 35,000 votes . Despite his loss , Gillum 's political capital was rising on the national stage . Rumors of a vice presidential nomination spread . In March 2020 , on Friday the 13th , Gillum , now 40 , was found in a heavily intoxicated state at the Mondrian hotel in Miami . Also present was an unconscious Travis Dyson , 30 , a registered nurse who allegedly also worked as an escort . A third man , Aldo Mejias , 56 , who rented the room , called the police after finding Andrew Gillum vomiting and Dyson struggling to stay conscious . Police found methamphetamine baggies in the room . Dyson was taken to Mount Sinai Medical Center , and both he and Gillum have since recovered . No arrests were made . The coronavirus pandemic has overtaken the initial public interest in the Gillum story , but the scandal 's far-reaching impact is just beginning to unfold . Andrew Gillum , a former mayor of Tallahassee , husband , and father of three , may have effectively squandered his political future . Though more details are sure to come , this unfortunate story already smells like familial heartbreak and political sabotage -- self-inflicted or otherwise . Considering the implications of the reports , I 'd be remiss not to acknowledge the challenges that are frequently and sometimes uniquely attached to black masculinity . Andrew Gillum , born in Miami and raised in Gainesville , Florida , is a true son of the Sunshine State . A child of blue-collar workers , Andrew had a humble , middle-class upbringing . Gillum was a star pupil throughout high school and college . He would go on to serve as president of student government while majoring in Political Science at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University -LRB- FAMU -RRB- , a historically black university . His early success foreshadowed his political career : Mr. America , Mr. Black America . At age 23 , before graduating college , he would be elected to the Tallahassee City Commission . In many ways , Andrew Gillum has displayed black excellence throughout his life . In 2009 , Gillum would marry his longtime girlfriend , R. Jai Howard -LRB- pronounced Ar-Jay -RRB- . The couple met at FAMU and like her husband , R. Jai also served in student body leadership . As political careers go , Andrew Gillum 's record was relatively clean . Until recently , 2018 's Hamilton-gate was perhaps the biggest scandal of his career . The Hamilton ticket controversy gained wider attention during his 2018 gubernatorial campaign . Hamilton-gate involved Gillum 's alleged acceptance of tickets from lobbyists in 2016 to see Hamilton on Broadway in New York City . Gillum denied the allegations but received a $ 5,000 from the Florida Commission on Ethics on charges of failing to report lobbyist gifts . Hamilton-gate , by comparison to Gillum 's current scandal , is quite tame . To the public , Andrew Gillum was still a political star , though there were grumblings about his sexuality . His relationship with his former mayoral campaign treasurer -LRB- 2014 -RRB- and longtime friend Adam Corey had historically drawn some whispered scrutiny . However , these rumors mainly lived on lesser-known corners of the internet . Interestingly , Adam Corey was friends with the lobbyist -- actually an undercover FBI agent -- who gave the Hamilton tickets to Gillum . Corey 's friendship with Gillum , which began in college , waned as the two cut ties around Hamilton-gate . Fast-forward to March 2020 : conservative commentator Candace Owens somehow obtains the Gillum police report containing each party 's contact information -LRB- Gillum , Dyson , Mejias -RRB- and releases it on Twitter . Democrat Andrew Gillum was involved in a crystal meth overdose incident last night in a Miami hotel . Orgy suspected , but unconfirmed . The obvious suspicion is that at the very least , Andrew Gillum participates in same-gender sexual relationships . Pictures of Gillum 's naked body quickly surfaced online . In the leaked photos , an individual with bare-feet can be seen standing over Gillum 's nude , unconscious body . According to reports , Gillum was too inebriated to communicate with police upon their arrival . Mejias , the third man in the hotel room , claims Dyson opened the door for him and then collapsed , as Gillum threw up in the bathroom . From Mejias 's account , his own involvement with Andrew Gillum and Travis Dyson remains unclear , though he -LRB- Mejias -RRB- paid for the hotel room . Andrew Gillum issued a statement shortly after the incident , citing struggles with alcoholism . `` I was in Miami last night for a wedding celebration when first responders were called to assist one of my friends . I want to be clear that I have never used methamphetamines . I apologize to the people of Florida for the distraction this has caused our movement . Since my race for governor ended , I fell into a depression that has led to alcohol abuse . I witnessed my father suffer from alcoholism and I know the damaging effects it can have when untreated . I had too much to drink . I know that alcoholism is often a symptom of deeper struggles , '' Gillum stated . Some reports confirm Gillum was indeed supposed to officiate a Miami wedding , but according to wedding attendees , he was a no-show . So far , details of this story lead to obvious pain and disappointment for the Gillum family , his supporters , and associates , but also to more questions . Who took the photos of Andrew Gillum 's nude and unconscious body ? Why were there no leaked photos of Dyson ? Who is Mejias , and what was his involvement with Gillum and Dyson ? Why did Mejias pay for the hotel room ? Who leaked the police report ? Sex seems to be the Achilles heel for many politicians , for more reasons than primal urge alone . Moreover , the combination of gay party life with meth is becoming an unfortunate regularity . For many queer men and queer black men , in particular , a successful career as a same-gender-loving individual had never been a practical option -- there were no models of that . Sex parties and hard drugs are the de facto mecca for many men struggling to live out another narrative . If Andrew Gillum is queer -LRB- bisexual or gay in this case -RRB- , it also juxtaposes the rigidity of black male sexuality to white male sexuality . Today , there are openly gay white politicians -LRB- Pete Buttigieg -RRB- . Would Gillum have had the same support as an openly queer black man in politics ? In 2020 , despite the growing media acceptance , when it comes to queerness in day-to-day life , America still leans conservative -- even more so in black communities . For Andrew Gillum , this likely meant that whatever same-sex feelings he may have experienced had to be buried under his accomplishments , his heterosexual marriage , his looks , and overall image : Mr. Black America , respectable HBCU grad . Today , Travis Dyson 's nursing license in Florida is under a `` voluntary withdrawal '' status . Much of Aldo Mejias 's background and current whereabouts remain unknown . Andrew Gillum has withdrawn from political life . Gillum 's political future is indefinitely dormant , but his future as a public figure may be bright . In time , perhaps this scandal could be an opportunity for Gillum to reemerge as a champion for the expansion and redefinition of black masculinity .

The order means people should stay home unless they 're working , visiting family , recreating outdoors or they 're out getting necessary goods or services . The order also limits the number of people that can be in stores based on square footage . All retail businesses still operating are ordered to limit customer activity by only allowing five customers per 1000 square feet or 20 % of their posted capacity in a store , whichever is less , according to the governor 's mandate . McMaster said a violation of his order is a misdemeanor and carries 30 days in jail and/or $ 100 fine for each day of violation . But most law enforcement across the Grand Strand and Pee Dee say they 'll only impose criminal penalties as a last resort . Glen Kirby , Chief Deputy for the Florence County Sheriff 's Office , said they 'll mostly be relying on citizens to report anyone disobeying orders . `` We 're not going to be pulling people on the roadways , checking them . If somebody calls and complains about a certain location , we 'll probably go there , '' Kirby said . He just hopes everyone will comply , because he said orders like this are difficult to enforce , especially when the FCSO still has to do its normal duties . `` It 's real difficult because we have a spike in domestic violence calls . We 're trying to patrol neighborhoods where we know kids are home alone and where their parents are working . We 're trying to stay there . We do n't really have time to be doing all this checking on people . We are hoping they 'll take this seriously , and that it can affect them and their family members , and they 'll just abide by what the governor said . But , we will respond if called , '' Kirby said . Georgetown County Sheriff Carter Weaver said his department , too , is seeing steady crime during this pandemic . `` We were hoping it would be a Hurricane Hugo type of event where we actually saw the crimes decrease and calls for service decrease for about six months after , but that 's not occurring at all , '' Weaver said . Weaver said his officers will continue to patrol the county as they normally do . `` This is n't a martial law situation and we 're not going to turn it into one . So , we 're asking for compliance because there 's a good reason behind it , and that 's just so we can get out of this thing quicker and get back to our normal lives , '' Weaver said . He said they 're hoping citizens comply , but it 'll soon become difficult for people to stay inside . `` We do n't know how long this is going to last , but we do know that as the weather starts to get better and warmer and people have been cooped up in their homes , it 's going to be a harder battle . It 's going to be an uphill battle , '' Weaver said . Horry County police say they are also relying heavily on voluntary compliance with this executive order . They are also pulling officers from special units to help patrol the streets . Conway Police Chief Dale Long said his unit 's plan is uniform with the county 's plans for enforcement . `` It 's going to be a very gentle process for us because the people who are affected by this are our neighbors and friends , '' Long said . `` We still have our normal crime response calls for service that we 're having to be mindful of . We would never have the manpower to ever stop doing our main mission . '' Myrtle Beach Police Department 's regulatory unit and patrol officers will be keeping an eye out and investigating complaints . A city spokesperson said the regulatory unit has even conducted some spot checks to make sure businesses , in particular , are complying with the governor 's orders . Georgetown County Sheriff Carter Weaver said his officers will begin on-site inspections at local businesses starting Tuesday evening . `` We are going to be holding businesses accountable to the social distancing rules that are coming out . That seems to be the governor 's intent after he spoke yesterday with his new order . The only way for him to be successful with that is for us to enforce it , '' Weaver said .", "url": "https://wpde.com/news/coronavirus/this-isnt-martial-law-how-stay-home-order-will-be-enforced-in-grand-strand-pee-dee", "kws": ["Pee^^Dee", "Grand^^Strand", "Florence", "law^^enforcement", "County^^Sheriff", "Georgetown^^County", "square^^feet", "Horry^^County^^police", "home", "criminal", "patrol^^officers", "Glen^^Kirby", "on-site^^inspections", "criminal^^penalties", "resort", "Governor^^Henry^^McMaster", "jail", "voluntary^^compliance", "S.C.", "square^^footage"], "text_category": {}}

'' The Guadalajara , Mexico-based evangelical Christian church was founded by his grandfather and claims 5 million followers worldwide . It was not clear when he would be released . The attorney general 's office said it was reviewing the court 's ruling . Garcia 's attorney did not immediately have a comment . The appeals court ruling states that the Los Angeles County Superior Court must dismiss the 29 counts of felony charges that include human trafficking , production of child pornography and forcible rape of a minor . The appeals court ruled that because Garcia 's preliminary hearing was not held in a timely manner and he did not waive his right to one , the complaint filed against him must be dismissed . The appeal only mentioned the dismissal of Garcia 's case and not those of his co-defendants , Susana Medina Oaxaca and Alondra Ocampo . A fourth defendant , Azalea Rangel Melendez , remains at large . It was not immediately clear whether the co-defendants ' cases would also be tossed . In February , a Southern California woman filed a federal lawsuit against the church and Garcia . In it , she said Garcia and his father sexually abused her for 18 years starting when she was 12 , manipulating Bible passages to convince her that the mistreatment actually was a gift from God .

Jet streams shooting from black holes are thought to be made of excited gas or plasma . The one in this image is thought to have been moving at almost the speed of light . This scene , featuring a black hole at the top of the image , was actually in the background of the original target . It was captured as the scientists studied an area in space known 3C 279 . 3C 279 is a region that experts refer to as a quasar . A quasar is a very bright centre of a galaxy that emits a large amount of energy . Some people suspect they are powered by supermassive black holes and may even represent an evolutionary stage in the formation of galaxies . The black hole in the image above is located in a quasar 5.5 billion light-years away from Earth . The scientists observed it when they studied the region to learn more about the behaviour of space around black holes . They actually did this back in April 2017 with the help of the Event Horizon Telescope . This newly revealed black hole image surprised the team because they thought a jet coming from a black hole would be straight but this one seems to bend at the base . It also has some features that can be seen perpendicular to the jet . Jae-Young Kim , leader of the analysis , said : `` We knew that every time you open a new window to the Universe you can find something new . `` Here , where we expected to find the region where the jet forms by going to the sharpest image possible , we find a kind of perpendicular structure . `` This is like finding a very different shape by opening the smallest Matryoshka -LSB- Russian nesting -RSB- doll . This research has been published in Astronomy & Astrophysics . What is a black hole ? The key facts Here 's what you need to know ... What is a black hole ? A black hole is a region of space where absolutely nothing can escape That 's because they have extremely strong gravitational effects , which means once something goes into a black hole , it ca n't come back out They get their name because even light ca n't escape once it 's been sucked in -- which is why a black hole is completely dark What is an event horizon ? There has to be a point at which you 're so close to a black hole you ca n't escape Otherwise literally everything in the universe would have been sucked into one The point at which you can no longer escape from a black hole 's gravitational pull is called the event horizon The event horizon varies between different black holes , depending on their mass and size What is a singularity ? How are black holes created ? TOP STORIES IN SCIENCE In other space news , a huge 2-mile asteroid will be visible from Earth this month . Nasa has revealed some of its plans for colonising the Moon .

The 17-year-old student began to speak with 36-year-old Denny Dean Holt about her personal life in November 2016 . The two then exchanged numbers and met outside the school for the first time the following month . The accused picked the teen up from home and the two then went for a ride . When the two were `` talking about anything and everything , '' he asked her about her sexual experiences with her boyfriend . A while later , he offered her money to see her breasts . The teen was initially reluctant but eventually agreed . The two then had sex in the car . The two had sex almost 15 times in the next six months . The encounters came to an end when she graduated from school in June 2017 . The incident came to light when police searched the teen 's phone regarding a separate case . During the testimony , the victim said there were times she initiated the encounters . She added that the two did have a discussion about the legality of them having sex during which the accused told her he could trust her to not tell anyone about it . She also said the accused had topless photos of her . Following an internal investigation , Grand Blanc Community Schools fired the accused in February 2018 and the man also had to lose his teaching degree . He was sentenced to imprisonment Thursday on one count of second-degree criminal sexual conduct . Last month , a Pennsylvania teacher was arrested for having sex with a 16-year-old high school student .

One side of the vicious dispute say they wo n't be clashing with the Mayfield gang any time soon after the call-out videos the groups uploaded got so much public attention . This morning a man from the Knocknaheeny gang sent a message to the others saying his group are `` prisoners in their own site all because of ye '' . He said : `` This is all over the world , everything , the media the lot of it . Another said : `` We 're sick of your Facebook war . You 'll be watching it and you 'll be getting it . It 's as simple as that . `` There 's no way the gangs can meet up now because the place is to hot for guards . `` But when you 're caught you 'll know what 's happening . You know that '' . Gardai were put on high alert last night after the two balaclava-clad groups vowed to go to war in clips taken in two areas on the northside of the city . The shocking videos showed the mouthy mobs goading the other side to come out and fight them . Reacting to the threats officers deployed to both Ballybovane and Mayfield to ensure no violence erupted . A garda spokesman said no arrests were been made in direct relation to the threats . The two families had previously waged war on eachother in January but a peace deal was later brokered with the help of the McDonaghs from Kilmallock . The gangs had vowed to move on but tensions rose over the last few weeks and it 's now coming to the brink again . It 's believed one of the gangs was connected to a shooting in the Mayfield area on March 15 . Two men were arrested after a group stormed an estate and open-fired on a house . A few days later a man was arrested in Knocknaheeny after gardai seized a handgun and petrol can from a car . Officers were alerted after locals became suspicious of the car in their area . Gardai rushed in to check it out and later found the gun and jerry can which they believe may have been intended for a hit attempt .", "url": "https://www.corkbeo.ie/news/local-news/cork-gang-put-coming-blows-18060866", "kws": ["Gardai", "call-out^^videos", "Cork", "blows", "guards", "man", "videos", "Facebook", "clips", "prisoners", "war", "tensions", "Kilmallock", "message", "eachother", "Mayfield", "time", "Knocknaheeny"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety_Other": 1.0000100135803223}}}

Video from around 12:30 in the morning on Tuesday shows the woman in hurriedly move toward the door , wrapped in a towel . Medford Police say the incident occurred on E. Main Street near N. Berkeley Way . The woman , wrapped in nothing but a towel , begins knocking desperately , heaving big breaths of air and crying . After knocking , she steps away from the door and looks away from the house -- as if to see if someone else is nearby or if she was being followed before she begins to hurriedly knock on the door again . `` Open up . Please , '' the woman says , as she bangs on the door desperately a third time . She again steps away from the door , clutching the towel around herself as she looks out and away from the home again .

Maybe a side dish for dinner -LRB- if ya nasty ! -RRB- . Pop cultural icon Nicole Richie , however , sees leafy-green foliage and organic produce not only as a segue into a new career as a trap goddess , but a vessel to get the world twerking at the club in the name of sustainable eating , crystals , preserving the bee population , and spiritual healing through environmental consciousness . How Richie honed that perspective serves as the basis for her new , whip-smart Quibi series Nikki Fre $ h , which she created and executive-produced as a satirical jab at the global commodification of wellness culture through hilarious vignettes that see the 38-year-old and her adorable , gender-bending assistant Jared -LRB- Jared Goldstein -RRB- navigating a mix of both scripted and improvised bits -LRB- one sees them trolling grocery store shoppers with samples of crystal-infused granola , another enlists Bill Nye -LRB- yeah , THE science guy -RRB- to twerk in the name of an `` Air Bee & Bee '' home for winged insects -RRB- and seemingly bougie-budgeted music videos that cap every episode . Still , the sentiment her rapper alter ego -LRB- inspired by , of all things , Oprah 's Instagram and her own desire to spread a message about the positive global impact of growing your own food -RRB- spews over bass-heavy bangers like `` U.G.L.Y. '' -LRB- an anti-food waste anthem -RRB- and `` Bees Tea '' -LRB- a truth-to-power bop about protecting bugs -RRB- is dead serious -- enough so that Richie , daughter of music legend Lionel Richie , enlisted music-industry heavy-hitters like songwriter Sarah Hudson -LRB- Katy Perry , Dua Lipa -RRB- , producer Andrew Goldstein -LRB- Demi Lovato , Britney Spears -RRB- , and her husband , Good Charlotte 's Joel Madden , to ensure that her first foray into recorded music sounded as expensive and serious as the show 's premise is silly . `` I thought about my younger self being in clubs and knowing the words to every single lyric of these dumbass songs ! You could play them now and I could probably tell you every single word . I probably knew them because I was moving and dancing . That 's how information really sinks in , '' Richie tells EW . `` I want to create music that 'll be played and busted out in clubs and people will be moving , swaying , and hopefully singing along to . They 'll go to bed wasted and wake up a little dehydrated , but also a little more educated ! '' New episodes of Nikki Fre $ h premiere daily on Quibi . Check out EW 's exclusive clip from Thursday 's episode above , and read on for our full interview with Richie , in which she discusses working with Hudson and Madden on her debut album , acclimating to life in the studio , whether or not The Simple Life will return , and finally anointing Nye as her hype girl -LRB- with major sex appeal and seductive dance moves -RRB- . ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY : This show is amazing . I never would 've thought trap songs about saving bees and food waste would get stuck in my head . Where did you get the idea to do this ? NICOLE RICHIE : I started working on an edible garden about seven years ago and hashtagging my harvests on Instagram , because that 's what Oprah did . So , obviously I needed to , also . I developed what I like to call a cult following because I was hashtagging #NikkiFre $ h , so that became my gardening stage name . I listen to music in my garden all the time , and I was out there one day and I said to myself that I wanted to share with the world how amazing , spiritual , and wonderful growing your own food is . I -LSB- thought -RSB- I 'm going to go with trap music . Obviously after thinking about it , I could n't do trap music and disrespect the genre . So , I created my own genre , which is parent trap . It 's music with a message : loving the environment , growing your own food , and being one with the universe . In the first episode , Nikki talks about the importance of singing to your garden -- did you sing these songs back to your garden at home ? I wish I could say I did . I recorded these songs in the studio , but I came up with a lot of the inspiration out there in my garden , yes . On my first studio session , I said , ` Ok guys , what time should I be there ? ' and the reply was ` How is 8 ? ' I said ` 8 is great ! I 'll take a pilates class , I 'll go to Earthbar , and I 'll be there at 8 a.m. ' And they said , ` 8 p.m. ' Right , I 'm a rapper now , which means I have to shift my clock a little bit . 8 p.m. is normally 30 minutes before my bedtime , so I 'll work on that . I know it 's the new thematic genre of parent trap , but the sound is something reminiscent of what you 'd hear in the club . Why does trap work well paired with social consciousness ? I thought about my younger self being in clubs and knowing the words to every single lyric of these dumbass songs ! You could play them now and I could probably tell you every single word . I probably knew them because I was moving and dancing . That 's how information really sinks in . I want to create music that 'll be played and busted out in clubs and people will be moving , swaying , and hopefully singing along to . They 'll go to bed wasted and wake up a little dehydrated , but also a little more educated ! Instead of leaning into superficiality like you did on The Simple Life , the way L.A. culture is presented on Nikki Fre $ h is now a satirical target for you . Why did you decide on presenting the series like that ? I do n't know if I knew that it was the right way , but it just lived inside of me . I 'm from L.A. , so , I can appreciate all of the stereotypes and jokes and things that go around with being from L.A. I 've heard it all . I 've been around it all . Some of it is very funny . I have a sense of humor ! I wanted to play into all of the stereotypes . Is it important to distinguish that you 're not making fun of the things Nikki raps about , because at their core , they 're serious issues ? These things really are important to me . I really do care about food . `` U.G.L.Y. '' is all about how much food gets thrown in landfills because it does n't aesthetically meet the need of grocery stores , and how our demand for perfect-looking food has become so big . You 'd be horrified if you knew how much food was thrown in landfills . Compared to how many people are starving in the world , that does n't add up . Did you work with any songwriters or producers for these songs that might surprise people ? Joel -LSB- Madden -RSB- and I wrote some of the songs together , and Sarah Hudson is a friend , she writes for Katy Perry and Dua Lipa . She 's got the best sense of humor ... . I was definitely nervous to call her because I think Dua Lipa had -LSB- just released `` Do n't Start Now '' -RSB- at that moment , and , via Instagram , Sarah felt very busy to me , but I was aiming high ! Can you walk me through a typical songwriting session ? I built the outline for the show first , so we had the episode breakdown before I even went into the studio . As far as what each song was going to be about , I already knew . Then , Sarah put me with this amazing producer , Andrew Goldstein , whom Joel has worked with as well . It was the four of us in these nighttime studio sessions , and we had a pretty tight deadline because of the timeline of the show and the fact that we had to shoot the music videos . On some of these songs I was shooting the show all day and going into the studio at night to write the songs . I love that whole `` I 'm in the studio '' -LSB- vibe -RSB- . I took so many selfies with headphones on and sent them to everyone I know . Were you concepting all of your own music videos too ? Chris Cottam , the director , did , but I came up with some of them . The `` Drip Drip '' music video is a love story between me and water . Jared Goldstein plays water , and it 's about how everyone deserves clean water and how we should all make a commitment to having clean water . The song has a very horny , high school type of sound , so I wanted to go back to those videos where LL Cool J was licking his lips , you know ? That vibe ! There 's a wedding ceremony , and it 's a love story . I came up with that concept by myself . What does your dad think of the songs ? I have n't played him the songs ! I know he saw the trailer and he texted me , but I do n't know if he 's heard the music yet . I was going to go big and have a listening party in the studio , like , a full-blown 1999 Mariah Carey moment . But , the world changed overnight and that party never happened . I think you should do it on Instagram Live now . I would love to , but I do n't even know how to do that . I have to find a millennial to help me ! Being a millennial , I was raised on Bill Nye , so I have to thank you for bringing him on episode 2 and not only getting him to talk about the importance of protecting the bees , but also acknowledging him as a sex symbol . He is ! Yes ! What is it ? Is it his knowledge ? The outfits are gold . His energy is just amazing . He 's smart and very handsome . What 's the problem !? Did it take some convincing to get him to dance to trap with you in the AirBee & Bee scene ? No ! I asked him . He 's very passionate about bees , and that was my first time meeting him . There are people who share the same love of bees , chickens , and gardens , so I called people who were into that type of thing . Like any bee lover , we 're all eager to talk about colony collapse and the danger of bees because we ca n't be here long without them . I think Bill was like , `` I have a responsibility to the bees to be on this show . '' I 'm making that up ... -LSB- Laughs -RSB- . It does speak to the seriousness of what you 're doing that Bill Nye said yes ! What did you think of his dance moves ? He was like Elvis . They really shook me ! Let 's say you do become a trap icon . Are there dream collaborations you have ? I would love to work with Big Freedia , and I would like for Wendell Berry to read something on my next album ! Quickly , I wanted to ask if you saw that whole thing last summer where someone used the @TheSimpleLife Twitter account and teased that it was coming back with Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan ? No , I did n't . Tell me ! I do n't know anything on the internet ! Someone logged onto the account and tweeted a photo of Lindsay and Paris and people went crazy . Wait , is there an official Simple Life Twitter account ? That 's really funny . It was n't legit , but the handle was @TheSimpleLife , so everyone thought it was real , and news sites picked up the story like it was happening ! I 'd be more shocked that there was an active Simple Life account , because who would be running it ? That show is like 20 years old . I want to meet the goddess who 's running that account in 2020 . The show is still so popular ! It 's on Amazon and I watch it all the time . You do !? That makes me so happy . Paris spoke about it recently that you guys are still friends . Would you ever do another Simple Life ? That show was what it was , and it was so much fun , but that concept would n't even work in this moment because , remember , we 'd leave our lives for a month and we did n't have any phones . No phones in this day and age just does n't work ! Also , we 're almost 40 years old , and I ca n't imagine leaving my kids . We 've got real jobs now . We were 20 or 21 when we did it . It was like backpacking through Europe : something you do in your twenties . If I could say something to my younger self , I 'd be like , `` Do it , because when else are you going to be able to go and do that ? '' That 's what your twenties are for .", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/nicole-richie-nikki-fresh-interview/", "kws": ["Nicole^^Richie", "trap^^songs", "Lionel^^Richie", "trap^^music", "hilarious^^vignettes", "seductive^^dance^^moves", "Britney^^Spears", "trap^^work", "Instagram^^Live", "songwriter^^Sarah^^Hudson", "Demi^^Lovato", "friends", "humor", "rapper", "Instagram", "winged^^insects", "parent^^trap", "Elvis", "Bees^^Tea", "Nikki^^Fre"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 0.9935544729232788}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Music": 0.9935544729232788}, "third_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Music_Other": 0.9935544729232788}}}

'' -- Tom Brady to Howard Stern on leaving Patriots -- Jimmy Traina -LRB- @JimmyTraina -RRB- April 8 , 2020 When asked about some of his most gruesome injuries , Brady told Stern about an injury to his groin area that was particularly detailed and disgusting . After Sports Hernia in 2006 , Brady 's Testicle Swelled Up ` Like An Orange ' Discussing a sports hernia he suffered in the middle of the 2006 NFL season , Brady got candid and descriptive about the injury . WARNING : the following story details a gruesome injury and contains some NSFW language . `` I thought when I got hit , something happened , '' Brady said about how the injury initially happened . `` It ended up being a hernia in the game , where the abdomen wall split open . I do n't know all the details . But other than that , -LRB- my -RRB- testicles -- literally , like , one side was like an orange and then the other side was normal . I was like , ` Something 's wrong here . ' '' Brady then got even more detailed , and told a story of a NSFW nickname he received from one of his teammates as a result of the injury . Former Patriots Backup QB Matt Cassel Teased Brady Repeatedly Brady noted he did not miss any time due to the injury , but he did have to endure loads of teasing from his former teammates . His former backup quarterback , current Kansas City Chiefs backup Matt Cassel , seemed to take particular delight in ribbing Brady about the injury . `` The guy who was my backup quarterback at the time , Matt Cassel , drew pictures of me with this one huge testicle on one side , and then he would leave them in my locker every day , '' Brady described to Stern . ``` Purple Balls , ' he 'd call me because I got all bruised up . Man , that sh*t hurt ... That was a really tough injury . There were a few of those over the years . '' `` Man , that shit hurt .

Brady also gave Stern a candid recollection of former tight end Rob Gronkowski 's locker rook proclivities . `` Gronk would get naked and literally throw his towel over his shoulder and just walk through the locker room with all the reporters and I would just laugh because Gronk obviously , he did n't give a sh*t .

That was certainly the case for parts of of the province on Tuesday night April 7 . Places including the GTA and London faced quite the Ontario storm last night , which even saw fist-sized hail batter some areas . On Tuesday evening and into the morning hours , heavy rainfall , thunderstorms , and stupidly large hail plummeted down . According to The Weather Network , thunderstorms and significant precipitation drowned many cities in Ontario , especially southwestern areas like Windsor , Essex , Leamington , and Chatham . Thankfully , most people in Ontario are spending their time indoors right now , and that 's probably a good thing , looking at some of this footage . However , although we may not have seen the excitement going on outside , plenty of residents sure heard it . Thanks to social media , pictures and videos were shared of the crazy storm and it looks way too scary . The size of the hail which fell seemed to vary from as small as a nickel to way bigger than a toonie . In fact , some photos show hailstones taking up most of some people 's palms . The areas where larger hail was reported were in north London but it reached all the way to some parts of Toronto in smaller sizes . Those who managed to hear what was happening outside made sure to capture the moment and share it onto their social media pages . And some of the footage was pretty apocalyptic , which did n't escape the notice of many residents , especially considering what 's going on in the world right now . `` It was n't apocalyptic enough right now , so Toronto added some hail to the mix , '' reads one tweet , while sharing images of the tiny particles of hail that managed to leave its mark in the city . This is n't the last bit of extreme storms Toronto and parts of southern Ontario will likely face this month . But this deluge of apocalyptic hail is a not-so-subtle reminder that winter weather is still not over . After all , Ontario was expected to be hit with thunder , snow and even a possible tornado this week .

The deputy met the girls while working as a deputy and then recruited them for his off-duty job , sending the teens into shops to try and buy cigarettes and other tobacco products , the Lake County Sheriff 's Office said . Deputy Jose Manual Rodriquez , 37 , was arrested Tuesday night in Clermont and held on three counts of solicitation to commit sexual performance by a child . Each charge is a second-degree felony . Rodriquez , a patrol deputy for four years , was booked into Lake County Jail and released on $ 60,000 bond , jail records show . `` Rodriguez was suspended during the investigation and termination proceedings are underway , '' according to a news release . According to the Sheriff 's Office , Rodriquez worked off duty as a compliance inspector for the ISN Corp. , a company that contracts with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to check for underage sales of tobacco . A person must be 21 to buy tobacco and related smoking products . The Sheriff 's Office said Rodriquez met the girls while patrolling the Minneola area and recruited them to work with him on the undercover tobacco purchases in Central Florida . According to an investigation , Rodriquez also asked the three teens to make pornographic videos for money . They were 16 and 17 when the alleged incidents occurred from 2016 to 2019 . An arrest affidavit states that Rodriquez said he knew someone who made underground porn videos , telling the teens they could make $ 500 to $ 800 . In one case , the affidavit says , Rodriquez told one teen he could set up the videos `` and the guy does n't have to know she 's a juvenile . '' Rodriquez met one of the teens when he stopped her for skipping school , another on a traffic stop and the third was a runaway , the affidavit states . None of the girls said they agreed to make the videos .

1.0	{"docid": "0Oh8of4Q", "title": "Quarantine horniness , explained by a sex researcher", "content": "In 2012 , the immortal chanteuse Britney Spears sang about the erotic thrill of the apocalypse . `` I ca n't take it , take it , take no more . Never felt like , felt like this before , '' she sang , voicing a deep , roiling desire to dance with someone she 'd just met . `` C'mon get me , get me on the floor . DJ , what you , what you waitin ' for ? '' Spears suggested her lust was so enthralling that not even global annihilation could get in her way . `` See the sunlight , we ai n't stopping . Keep on dancin ' 'til the world ends , '' Spears continued . `` If you feel it , let it happen . Keep on dancin ' 'til the world ends . '' The reality of our current apocalyptic scenario -- the coronavirus pandemic -- is a lot less sexy than the sweaty , bare-skin-pressing-on-bare-skin circumstances Spears envisioned . Quite the opposite . People living in 42 states -LRB- and counting -RRB- have been told to stay home , following the leads of countries like Italy and Spain that have gone on full lockdowns . Government officials have begged people to not just remain indoors but also to cut off any physical contact with others . The aim of this restrictive measure is to reduce the spread of the virus , not letting it jump from person to person . And sacrificing physical contact for the global good means that interactions with people you do n't share a home with now exist primarily online over texts , Zoom calls , direct messages , and social media . Through social distancing , we 're cut off from most physical contact with our friends and family . We 're also meant to keep away from people we were having sex with or want to have sex with , unless we already live with those people . And all the people who were having or were interested in having sex with us ca n't pursue those aims , either . In Spears-speak , everyone you want to dance with 'til the world ends is now off-limits . But that has neither stopped people from irresponsibly hooking up -LRB- or claiming to be -RRB- , nor kept some from pursuing and being pursued . While there are directives from health officials -- New York City has a widely circulated memo about how its horny residents should refrain from hooking up and send nudes or video chat instead -- I wanted to ask experts about why some people 's sex drives are even more stimulated than normal during a time where we ca n't tap into those desires with other people . I also wanted to know : How risky is it to act on those sexual desires with someone , even if they 're also self-quarantining ? Being hornier than usual right now is perfectly normal . So is not wanting to have sex at all . In the first week of social distancing , I noticed a few more green circles popping up on my Instagram feed than usual . Green circles are the platform 's way of indicating that you 're on someone 's `` Close Friends '' list , seeing a post made for a specific set of eyes decided on by the user . On my Instagram feed , these Close Friends posts usually come from gay men sharing thirst traps , a particularly randy brand of photo or video -- usually shirtless , sometimes featuring underwear -- that 's designed to get attention . The goal is to get the viewer to slide into your DMs , usually sending a reply involving the fire or eyeballs emoji . The question became clear : Was the lockdown on physical intimacy driving up the frequency , and thirstiness , of these private posts ? Instagram told me on March 23 that although there have been upticks in use of the platform 's `` live '' feature since March 16 -LRB- when the first US quarantine measures went into effect -RRB- , it did n't have specific data on whether there has been a dramatic change in frequency of `` Close Friends '' posts on the platform during the past month or so of worldwide quarantine measures . Without a solid answer and nothing more than anecdotal evidence , I asked the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University , which studies human sexuality and relationships , for its take . Kinsey is in the middle of conducting a study on how the pandemic has affected people 's sexual relationships , and its researchers have found that the number of people engaging in sexual behavior online has increased , as well as the number of people who have completely disengaged . `` When you look at the data , you actually see movement at both ends , '' social psychologist Justin Lehmiller , a research fellow at Kinsey and author of Tell Me What You Want : The Science of Sexual Desire , told me . `` You have a higher percentage of people now who are saying -LSB- that -RSB- they 're masturbating and having more sex . But you also have a higher percentage of people saying they 're not engaging in any sexual behavior at all . And the people at the low end and not having any behavior -- that increase is much bigger than the increase at the other end of the spectrum . '' Lehmiller says experiencing a lack of sex drive is tied to the distress of the situation . The death tolls ratchet up constantly , horrific stories come out of hospitals each day , projections talk about hundreds of thousands of deaths , and it seems inevitable that by the end of the pandemic , each one of us will know someone that 's been affected by the disease . Not being in the mood is completely understandable . But that same apocalyptic scenario can trigger arousal too . `` There 's a whole body of research and the theory is called Terror Management Theory , '' or TMT , Lehmiller said . `` The idea behind it is that when we face the prospect of our own mortality , it leads us to cope , or it leads us to change our attitudes and behaviors in a way that it 's designed to cope with that existential threat . '' And for some people , TMT manifests itself in sexual interest and desire , or adopting new ways to express themselves sexually . Those expressions could be sexting , sending nudes , or initiating video chats -- all of which can spin off from a single thirsty Close Friends post . `` Something we 're seeing in our data is that people are incorporating more online sexual activities that maybe they 've never done before into their sex life as a way of getting some sexual fulfillment and also connection with other people , '' Lehmiller told Vox . `` So it definitely does seem to be the case that there is more sexting , for example , going on right now . And more sending of nudes and other things like that . '' Our social etiquette and norms have also changed . Many people may now have much more privacy to send a sext or DM at any time of day . Nights and weekends -- times when Lehmiller says we 're most likely to engage in sex-seeking behavior -- are now almost indistinguishable from afternoons and weekdays , blurring the lines of when it 's appropriate for us to start flirting and thirst-trapping . And there are now a lot of people home during the day to receive and reciprocate these messages . These different factors can really do a number on the way our sex drives respond . I asked Lehmiller why my circle of gay friends and several gay men I spoke to in particular seemed to notice more thirst traps on Instagram and DMs than they did before . The research that Lehmiller is doing at Kinsey , which surveys more than 1,000 participants , found that gender or sexual orientation was n't a determining factor in whether someone was expressing themselves more during the pandemic , he said . `` The people that are most likely to experience that increased in sexual desire are people who already are very comfortable with their bodies and have a positive body image , '' Lehmiller told me . `` If you 're somebody who was embedded in a network of people that had a level of interest in sex to begin with , you 're probably seeing even higher levels of sexual interest coming out right now . '' Why it 's so risky to sleep with someone right now , even if they 're social distancing I spoke to a number of people for this article , and found that , although Lehmiller said gender and sexual orientation was n't really a factor in sexual behavior , the gay men I interviewed seemed to be the most frank , candid , and innovative when it comes to their online sex lives . A 31-year-old New Yorker whom we 'll call Andrew told me about a 32-person Instagram group DM he participates in where nudes are exchanged . `` It started as a , ` Can I send you nudes during these trying times ? ''' he told me , explaining how the massive DM chain began as a poll . `` And a ` yes ' vote was basically consent for receipt and I got a lot of yeses , so I thought , would n't it be fun ? '' The group is so popular , Andrew said , that there 's apparently a waitlist to get into the DM chain . Hunter -LRB- whose name has been changed to protect his privacy -RRB- , a 24-year-old from New York , explained that he too has been sending out more nudes and posting flirty Close Friends Instagram stories because physical intimacy is off the table . `` I started doing it naturally just because of the circumstances , but it 's reinforced by seeing so many of my peers doing the same thing , '' Hunter said . `` I think we 'd all rather spend our time flirting and complimenting each other instead of thinking about sickness and death . '' Hunter and Andrew are actually following the New York City 's public health directive , which encourages `` video dates , sexting or chat rooms '' as opposed to meeting people online . And they , like their fellow New Yorkers , have been asked to socially distance themselves for more than three weeks now . Theoretically speaking , that 's longer than the reported incubation period for the disease . But it 's important to keep in mind that just because people have dutifully followed self-quarantine measures and think they might be okay to go out to see someone once in a while , it does n't mean that they no longer pose a risk to each other . It 's simple : Sleeping with someone who does n't live in your home is still a risk , because at this point , anyone outside of your own home could stand as a health risk to you right now . `` Social distancing reduces your risk greatly , and it reduces the risk that you pose to others greatly , but it 's no guarantee that you did n't get it when you went to the grocery store three days ago , '' Anna Muldoon , a former science policy adviser at the US Department of Health and Human Services and PhD candidate researching infectious disease and social crises at Arizona State University , told me . `` Every time you leave your house , there 's some level of risk . When people say they 've been self-quarantining for two weeks , very few of them actually mean they 've had zero risk of exposure in two weeks . And the other thing is , on your way to that -LSB- sex -RSB- date , you 've got to get there somehow , and that 's another exposure risk . '' Muldoon said perhaps someone living in your neighborhood or even your building could be the least worst choice to sleep with for someone who absolutely ca n't hold off . -LRB- Muldoon does not recommend sleeping with a neighbor , emotionally speaking . -RRB- She said that people who go to the same places that you 're going to are generally exposed to the same level of risk as you . `` Humans are going to do human things , and sex is a very human thing , '' Muldoon said . `` I think that if you 're in a situation where it 's like you 've talked to the person long enough that you really believe that they 're following all the precautions , and you 're in the same neighborhood having to walk the same streets , or go to the same grocery store anyway , your risk is relatively similar . I do n't love the idea , because you are increasing both of your risk , but you 're probably being exposed to the same things . '' The thing to keep in mind if you do decide to have sex during these troubling times , experts say , is that it 's not just your health you 're going to worry about . You 're making yourself responsible for someone 's health and vice versa . It 's a personal call as to whether that 's a decision you want to make .

Somewhere in between is the Kindle short story industry , where hordes of writers hastily produce a few thousand erotic words that ... someone then buys for .99 cents . It 's the Dollar Store for horniness . And sure enough , mere weeks after PornHub provided us with the GoPro variety of coronavirus porn , Amazon 's erotica section has delivered theirs . Some are clearly jokes , like Chuck Tingle of `` pounded in the butt by various billionaire mythological creatures and/or abstract concepts '' fame writing a whole pandemic-based trilogy with Bisexual Vampire Unicorns Teach Me The Importance Of The Vampire Cough , The Physical Manifestation Of Washing My Hands Gets Me Off , and Not Pounded By Anything While I Practice Responsible Social Distancing . Some were obviously unrelated stories the writers just had lying around that they slapped the word `` coronavirus '' on , like Love in the Time of Coronavirus : 20-Book Gender Swap Bundle or Quaranteen : Step-Sibling Love In The Time Of The Coronavirus : A Story Of Taboo Romance . -LRB- As with the plots of most of these stories , that title notably features two colons . -RRB- Others , however , are impressively specific . There 's no way anyone could have predicted the market for COVID-69 or Quarantined With My Hot Roommates a month ago , which raises the question : Why is there a market for these things ? Some have tried to explain it as the typical erotic story , full of `` chance encounters , '' no longer `` ringing true , '' but authenticity has never really been an issue for people writing and reading about 17th-century pirates who know about the G-spot . It seems more likely that what 's going on here is the same thing as fantasizing about nonconsensual situations or other types of victimization -LRB- which , yes , is extremely common -RRB- : By eroticizing a fear , it becomes less scary . Imagining that you could be unwittingly locked up with a one-night stand with nothing to do but test each other 's sexual limits is a lot more appealing than the boring and terrifying reality of choosing between groceries and maybe death . Or they 're all jokes . No one is writing Bored and Fertile -LRB- Coronavirus Quarantine Erotica Book 2 -RRB- without their tongue firmly in cheek when it 's not otherwise occupied , but jokes are just another method of dealing with fear . Whatever the case , as terrible as everything is right now , at least it 's given us a lot of time to think about the psychological power of the human boner .

While most of us probably agree sleeping with someone else is a definite non-no , it appears likes on social media , chatting with your ex and watching porn are grey areas . \u26a0 Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates Website IllicitEncounters.com asked its members about what counts as being unfaithful , and what is acceptable in a relationship . Out of the 2,000 people asked , there were some clear banned behaviours , although men and women had different opinions when it came to certain scenarios . Firmly in the cheating category is sexy video or phonecalls , along with sexting and exchanging nudes or naughty pictures . Using online dating sites was also classed as being two-timing , although interestingly only watching paid porn is frowned upon . And catcalling was also deemed as being unfaithful . Meanwhile behaviours which are seen as fair game are likes on social media , free porn and flirty banter in group chats . Also allowed is reading an erotic novel , thinking sexy thoughts about someone and bizarrely chatting to your ex was n't classed as cheating . But there was a division among the sexes , with 86 per cent of blokes saying free porn , such as Porn Hub versus Porn Hub Premium , did n't count as cheating , compared to 74 per cent of women . While 73 per cent of men thought flirty messages in a group chat was acceptable , only 56 per cent of women agreed . And it turns out 70 per cent of women think chatting to your ex is fine , while only 57 per cent of men shared that opinion . Sex and relationships expert , Jessica Leoni , said : `` It 's about time myths around what is and what is n't cheating were debunked . `` We 're going to reach a virtual cheating spike over the next couple of months as tensions are high at home and spouses are looking for an outlet . `` I 'm ecstatic that catcalling has made the cheating list , it is n't acceptable even when you are single ! `` It 's interesting to see that watching porn can be on both lists depending on whether it 's free or not .

If you make a purchase using the links included , we may earn commission . A mouth of full ` o braces . AC/DC paraphernalia . Hydro Flasks . People throw a lot of money at metal goods . But a metal sex toy ?? Well , I did . And according to sex toy guru and pleasure expert Carly S. , founder of Dildo or Dildo n't , a lot of other orgasm-seekers do , too . Meet : the Njoy Pure Wand . You 're probably familiar with soft silicone toys that buzz , pulse , or suck , so I know what you 're thinking : `` A metal sex toy !? '' Lucky for you , I 've reached the state of self-isolation where I 've had plenty of time to reflect on exactly why I love this toy so much . Scroll to read what it is I love about this hefty babe -- and why I think it should be your #quarantinebae , too . What is the Njoy Pure Wand , exactly ? `` The Njoy Pure Wand is a cult classic , '' says Carly S. `` People LOVE this toy , '' she says . At 7.5 inches long and 1.5 pounds , the Pure Wand is a curved , stainless steel dildo . But do n't worry , this dildo looks nothing like a fleshy penis . With two bulbous beads at either end , it looks like an enormous belly button ring . `` Some educators refer to the Pure Wand as an ` Heirloom Pleasure Product ' because the stainless steam it 's made out of is high-quality enough to outlast us all , '' says Carly S . How to use the Njoy Pure Wand for G-spot stimulation You might be wondering what the point of a non-vibrating bedmate is considering most sex toys you hear about vibrate . -LRB- Or `` do n't '' hear about a la : This Ultra Quiet Vibrator Is About to Become Your New Best Friend While Social Distancing -RRB- The point , well , is more of a spot -- specifically the G-spot . `` People with vaginas have a nerve-dense patch of tissue about two inches inside the vagina along their front vaginal wall , behind the pubic bone , that 's known as a G-spot , '' explains Carly S . In a toy-free world , you can find this spot by inserting one or two fingers into your vagina , and curving them up toward the front of your body . When you 're aroused , this area will feel rough , kinda like the roof of your mouth . -LRB- FYI : The G-spot is just one of four deep vaginal erogenous zones you should check out . -RRB- If you 're someone with a sensitive G-spot -LRB- friendly reminder : everyone has different hot spots ! -RRB- , applying firm , consistent pressure to this zone can cause a rush of feel-good sensation , a G-spot orgasm , or even a squirting orgasm , she says . But depending on how much pressure your G-spot needs , doing this by hand can get tiring ! Now , IDK about you , but nothing cockblocks my climax quite like a cramp in my forearm . That 's where the Njoy Pure Wand comes in . `` The angle , weight , and curvature of the toy allow you to easily find and apply the needed firm pressure to the pleasure zone , without much work on your end , '' says Carly S. And fam , let me tell you , that is tried and true . Like , G-spot-orgasm-in-under-three-minutes true . What Else Can You Do with the NjoyPure Wand ? Pffft -- do n't insult the Pure Wand . She 's no one-hit wonder ! Even if G-spot stimulation is n't your jam , this babe can still feel ahhmazing internally . The bulbs are slightly different sizes -- one is an inch wide , the other is an inch and a half wide . So , if you like feeling full AF , go big-end first . Or , plop this baby in the freezer for an hour . Then , apply a thick layer of GoLove CBD Lube to your bits and use the smaller side to engage in a little solo temperature play . Oh , and you can also put this babe in your butt . `` The curved shape helps anchor the toy outside your body , which means it 's completely safe for anal play , '' says Carly S. `` The wall between the anus and the vagina is so thin that many people are able to experience G-spot orgasms through backdoor stimulation . '' Best part ? Because stainless steel is a non-porous material , in the instance that you do get a lil fecal residue on the toy -LRB- hey , it happens -RRB- , you can rinse it right off with -LRB- fragrance-free -RRB- soap and water and she 's good as new . -LRB- PS : All toys you put in your butt should be non-porous like the Pure Wand , or these other sexpert-recommended anal sex toys . -RRB- Beyond its functionality as a sex tool , `` the toy can also be used as a trigger point massager , '' according to Carly S. Hold onto the end and toss the toy behind your back to muscle out your tension knots . -LRB- Looking for another toy that doubles as a back massager ? Check out the Le Wand -RRB- . Why Now Is the Perfect Time to Try the Njoy Pure Wand For starters , at this moment in time , everyone 's life could use a little more pleasure and a little less stress . And masturbation has literally been found -LRB- by science and also through my personal exploration -RRB- to reduce stress . Most people have a go-to masturbation technique and/or toy -- but with all the time most of us now have on our hands , why not experiment with something new ? `` Exploring new sensations gives us more information about what feels good , and what feels not-so-good , which we can use to enhance our solo , partnered and multi-partnered sex lives , '' says Carly S. Basically , that means that even if you and your boo are n't isolating together , you can use this time to improve your sex life . Experimenting today = more orgasms post-pandemic . Besides , the best-case scenario is you that discover the pleasure-potential of your G-spot ! Or you ejaculate ! Or you learn you love temperature play ! And the worst-case scenario ? Well , you dropped $ 150 dollars -- yes , * sigh , * this babe falls on the pricier side of things -- on a very nice back massager . But the Pure Wand did n't earn its title as `` My Quarantine Bae '' or `` a Cult Classic '' for nothing . So the odds you do n't fall head-over-orgasm for this sex toy too are pretty damn slim .

In acquitting Daniel Adler , the Court of Appeal said it had no choice other than to exclude key evidence against him given the `` blatant disregard '' for his charter rights . `` In doing so , the court acquits a person who is clearly guilty of serious criminal offences , '' Justice Ian Nordheimer wrote . `` This unpalatable result is a direct product of the manner in which the police chose to conduct themselves . '' Adler was at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto in August 2016 when a woman told patrolling officers she had seen him doing an upskirt video using a camera hidden in the head of a stuffed owl . As police approached him , they saw him fumble with the head , place something in his mouth , and then swallow , according to court records . The officers arrested him . They also confiscated several items , including the stuffed owl and digital devices , including a video camera that had no memory card . For several hours , police did not let Adler speak to a lawyer . They did , however , strip search him and set up a `` bedpan vigil . '' They also went inside his apartment that night without a warrant before withdrawing to await a tele-warrant . Officers then searched the apartment , finding parts of stuffed animals and an external computer hard drive . The following day , the prosecution delayed his bail hearing for several days without telling the judge it was to see if he passed the memory card . He did , but the card was unreadable . A search of items police had seized turned up evidence of child pornography . They also found a video of Adler having sexual contact with an unknown woman who appeared to be unconscious , leading to a sexual assault charge , court documents show . Despite misgivings about the searches , Ontario court Judge Malcolm McLeod convicted Adler on July 20 , 2018 , of child pornography and sexual assault based entirely on the evidence found on the seized devices . He sentenced him to 3\u00a01/2 years in prison . In deciding the appeal , the higher court said the tele-warrant for his home should not have been issued because there was simply no urgency to the situation given that Adler was in detention . Nordheimer also found officers were misleading when they applied for their warrants . The judge , he said , had been `` much too quick '' to excuse the police conduct that involved seven separate breaches of Adler 's rights . Those included delaying his right to a lawyer , keeping an unauthorized vigil for him to eliminate the memory card , misleading the courts during bail hearings , and entering his home without a warrant . `` That litany of breaches is remarkable for a single arrest on a single event , '' Nordheimer said . `` It reflects a sweeping ignorance by the police of the appellant 's constitutional rights . '' The overall result was that the police misconduct `` tainted '' all the evidence , leaving no option but to enter an acquittal , the justice said . Adler had been allowed to remain on bail pending the outcome of his appeal due to the COVID-19 crisis . This report by The Canadian Press was first published on April 8 , 2020 .

And while some may appear to make sense , others can leave you confused and often terrified with a jumbled mess of images moulding together . \u26a0 Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates Now , two experts have revealed some of the most common things people are dreaming about - and exactly what they may mean about you and your subconscious fears . From losing control of a car , to disturbing sex dreams with people you 'd never normally imagine yourself in bed with - dream experts Dr Ian Wallace and Jane Teresa Anderson have shared their thoughts with the Sun Online to reveal what they really mean about you . `` Most people are saying to me that their dreams are not only vivid , but they 're movie length dramas ! '' Jane Teresa says . `` Often our dreams are more vivid when they 're more emotional . '' Meanwhile , Dr Wallace explains that many people are remembering their dreams more than usual . `` Quite simply , many people are no longer waking up to their usual alarm - which would usually switch off any dreaming activity and make it fade straight away , '' he explains . `` Waking up more naturally means dreaming , as the fourth stage of any sleeping cycle is right before waking and you remember it more . '' Here , they both unpick some of the most common coronavirus dreams ... Losing control of a car Jane Teresa , 65 , says a particularly common dream she 's heard of in recent weeks from her clients is the feeling of losing control - whether it be in an out-of-control car , or in a work situation . `` What the dream is doing is processing the last one to two days of all your conscious and unconscious experiences to try to make sense of your world -- and what most people are experiencing at the moment is uncertainty , '' she says . `` It 's more highlighted at the moment because people think , ` oh , I had the illusion that I had control over my life , that what I decide to do always works out , or I chose this career because I knew I 'd always be safe and suddenly that 's not true anymore ' . `` Dreams are reflecting people 's fears and feelings of being out of control . That can stretch right from work to your personal life -- even if the actual dream is n't focused on that one thing . '' She says a simple solution can be reimagining the dream while you 're awake , and in the case of the car , imagine a small semblance of control - whether it be slowing down slightly , or changing lanes . Losing your phone or even your teeth While losing your phone is scary enough , some people can even dream of losing much more precious things too - including their teeth . Give now to The Sun 's NHS appeal BRITAIN 's four million NHS staff are on the frontline in the battle against coronavirus . But while they are helping save lives , who is there to help them ? The Sun has launched an appeal to raise # 1MILLION for NHS workers . The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need . We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid-19 Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it . The Sun is donating # 50,000 and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds , to help THEM . No matter how little you can spare , please donate today here www.thesun.co.uk/whocareswinsappeal `` The closer the thing is to your identity , the more likely you 'll dream about losing it , '' Jane Teresa explains . `` For example , we all identify that ` that 's my phone and my phone number , or my handbag , or my credit card ' -- the closer it is to your identity or sense of belonging , then the more likely it is the dream will focus on it . `` You think , if I lose my job , do I lose my identity ? I fear or feel I 'm losing something around my sense of belonging -- I thought I belonged in this job , or this relationship , or the tribe of people that are ultra healthy , or a stable society , whatever it is . You 're questioning where you fit in this world now . '' Feeling trapped There is one dream theme that both experts have come across recently however - the notion of feeling trapped . Dr Wallace , 61 , says : `` There 's a typical dream where you 're trying to get somewhere , but as you progress towards that place , it becomes more and more difficult with more obstacles . `` Or you might be walking down a corridor and it 's getting narrower -- you 're trying to squeeze through a small space . `` I 've heard that dream a lot from people who have had to stop working . They may not be able to do their job from home . `` It may represent you trying to reach an objective , but you 're having to navigate through lots of different obstacles to get there . '' Whatever you dream of , the reason behind it is likely rooted in the recent order to self-isolate . `` At this particular time , people may feel trapped in their house -- particularly if they 're on their own -- or they may feel trapped with their partner that they never intended to spend so long with , '' Jane Teresa explains . A loved one dying Of course , one of the most emotionally draining dreams you can have is a vivid image of a loved one dying . Jane Teresa says : `` We 're all contemplating death more at the moment -- not only whether people we know may die , or we ourselves may die , but also thinking about deeper things like what death actually means . `` It 's quite common at the moment to specifically dream about death because of that . `` But by the same token , death dreams are very common in normal times too and will come up when we feel like there 's change in the air , we feel like there 's going to be a death of the old in preparation for the new -- whether it 's thinking of changing a job or embracing a new attitude . `` Now , it could be that the old world as we knew it will be dead and gone , and new things may be happening . '' Being chased by a faceless terror Most people will have dreamt of being chased by a predator at some point in their life - they can be some of the most unsettling dreams of all . And Dr Wallace says they 're particularly common now . `` It 's that feeling that something is pursuing you . A lot of clients have said recently that the chaser is faceless , they ca n't identify them , '' he says . `` It 's more prominent now because people feel there are threats lurking everywhere , when you go down to the shops you 're worrying about people looking ill or sneezing , it 's everywhere . `` It 's also faceless in our dreams because a lot of these coronavirus cases can be asymptomatic , you do n't always realise you have it . '' Swept away by a tsunami Another terrifying dream both experts say could be very common now is the vision of a tsunami or huge wall of water rising up before you in the sea . Dr Wallace says , very simply , water represents our emotions - so seeing a giant wall of it coming towards you signifies an overwhelming amount of emotions you 're struggling to deal with . `` Some people also describe it as being swept away by water -- it 's about a lack of control , '' he says . `` I had one lady who I worked through this with , and at first it was a tsunami ... We discussed how she could perhaps set some emotional boundaries for herself , and then the dreams have now changed so she 's in a swimming pool -- which is quite a contained set of emotions . `` These emotions can be very overwhelming at the moment , which could trigger these dreams . '' And Jane Teresa agrees , saying you may feel , quite literally , `` flooded '' by emotions . `` It 's total helplessness , '' she explains . `` You need to decide whether to go with the flow , or sit with it for a while to try and find your own solution . '' Caught naked in public While it 's the age-old horror dream many will have had in their lives , finding yourself naked in public could be cropping up in your sleep more recently too . Jane Teresa explains : `` Classically this dream means you 're concerned that everyone will see the real you , not the naked you , but the real you . `` You ca n't put on your image with your corporate suit or whatever . `` But on a simple level now , some people may be worrying that they ca n't have their roots dyed , they ca n't have their hair cut , they ca n't have their Botox . `` We 're having to step away from worrying about our image -- maybe that will be one of the gifts of this ! '' Disturbing sex dreams However , perhaps trumping the naked in public dream is the disturbing sex dream . And with some partners separated , and single people unable to date , Jane Teresa says it 's natural that many people will be dreaming about sex more than usual . And some may imagine it with very inappropriate people . `` It 's both the longing for sex coming out , as well as a more symbolic side . It can literally be about what you want to unite with and bring into your life . `` If you dream about having sex with a certain person , you have to think about what they mean to you . Perhaps they represent keeping a level head . `` It 's important with sex dreams to remember that they are symbolic , because a lot of people may get very worried about some -- for example , having sex with a relative or friend . `` It could be totally inappropriate and may make you feel very concerned , wondering what it means , but a lot of them are symbolic -- that person may just represent something you want . '' Unable to get through to someone For Dr Wallace , one of the main dreams he 's heard his clients report recently is the feeling of helplessness at not being able to get through to someone . `` The classic dream theme is you 're trying to dial a number , you 're trying to phone someone , or someone asks you for your phone number and you ca n't remember it , '' he says . `` In this current situation , this idea of trying to get through to someone is really a result of all the mixed messaging we 've been getting from authorities , from medical advisers , from experts in different countries . `` It 's like , ` go out for an hour , no do n't go out , everything will be fine ' . `` People feel unsure how to pick up messages that they 're being given and how to respond to them , and that comes across in dreams . '' Bugs crawling over you Meanwhile , it 's no secret that being cooped inside with a partner or housemate can lead to one of you snapping more than usual , as irritation levels reach an all time high . And , according to Jane Teresa , the most common way that manifests itself in your dreams is through things like bugs crawling over you - making you feel irritated and angry , with no real solution . She adds : `` There may also be lots of dreams of ex-partners and going back over issues that have cropped up before and are now cropping up again . `` For any dream , you need to look at the metaphor or analogy , where does this apply in my life at the moment ? '' Snakes and spiders It 's not just annoying critters making their way into our dreams . According to Dr Wallace , snakes and spiders are particularly common now . He says : `` Most people are dreaming about a snake at the moment . The word virus is Latin and essentially means ` poison ' -- which we usually associate with snakes . `` The other common one is dreams about spiders . These are usually about your relationships that are n't going too well -- you may feel trapped or entangled in a web . '' Food-related dreams With supermarket shelves lying empty and queues of people outside supermarkets , it 's understandable that food is cropping up in many people 's dreams now too . But it could be about far more than your concerns over your next meal . `` When we dream , it 's not usually in a literal fashion , it 's often imaginary , '' Dr Wallace explains . `` When we dream about food , it 's actually about why food is important to us . It usually symbolises fulfilment or success . `` So now we 've had to stop work for a while and ca n't pursue our appetite for success , we may start having these food dreams . `` They 're usually either about bad food or not getting enough food -- for example , everyone else getting served in a restaurant , but you 're not . '' Both experts suggest taking a deep breath when you wake up , and thinking over what each of your dreams may have meant - unpicking how you feel in real life , before solving the problems as best you can .", "url": "https://www.the-sun.com/lifestyle/656914/what-your-coronavirus-dreams-really-mean/", "kws": ["disturbing^^sex", "snakes", "bizarre", "death^^dreams", "coronavirus", "spiders", "critters", "bed", "emotions", "tsunami", "movie^^length^^dramas", "things", "Bugs", "helplessness", "normal^^times", "irritation^^levels", "single^^people", "dream^^experts", "public^^dream", "cars"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Society": 0.5547271966934204}, "second_cat": {"Society_Other": 0.5547271966934204}}}

Jones was one of six individuals involved in the rape , which was filmed and distributed as the teenage boy was incapacitated .

Kanye was wearing a pair of unreleased boots from his Yeezy Season 8 collection , but when they finally hit the shelves they might be seen as a bit of an acquired taste . The bright yellow footwear feature chunky soles and a wide puffy design that makes the feet look bigger than they are .

Kanye , who regularly dresses wife Kim in his clothing , thinks his brand is the best thing since sliced bread . He told the Wall Street Journal : `` I believe that Yeezy is the McDonald 's and the Apple of apparel . `` In order to make the Apple of apparel the next Gap , it has to be a new invention .

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has eased those restrictions , but it did n't do away with them altogether . Men who have sex with men now only have to wait three instead of twelve months since their last sexual encounter before they can give blood . The FDA made the change last week because of a nationwide blood shortage . Hope & Help 's Adam Troy says he 'd like to replace the wait time with more detailed questions that determine a donor 's risk regardless of their sexual orientation or gender . `` I mean , I think the steps that we need to take is focus on individual risk and just stop making sort of blanket statements that focus on a particular segment of the population . '' Orlando 's LGBT + Center Director George Wallace says as long as this rule is in place , potential donors are being turned away when blood and platelets are needed more than ever . `` I would like to see people no matter what sexual orientation they are to be able to go to the local blood bank and not have to answer those really uncomfortable questions and be able to donate blood and save lives . '' The FDA also reduced the wait time from twelve to three months for women who have sex with gay and bisexual men and people who have gotten tattoos and piercings .

'' It 's a good thing she did n't waver . Especially now , as the nation 's healthcare system is strained due to the COVID-19 pandemic . Cooper is part of a small group of recent Oregon Health & Science University graduates who are set to begin their hospital residencies early to help alleviate the burden put on healthcare workers . And although medical student graduates are entering this field in an uncertain and scary time , many say taking care of those in need is why they chose to be doctors in the first place . Cooper , who studied rural family medicine at OHSU , will begin a residency at Cascades East Family Medicine in Klamath Falls on April 20 , well ahead of her original July 1 start date . There 's no way that anyone could have predicted that Cooper and her fellow graduates would be entering medicine during a global health pandemic , but Cooper says that added element of danger does n't change a thing for her . `` We 're most needed when it 's most dangerous , '' she said . `` I think we 're always at some amount of risk , and we have to understand that being at risk is part of the job . '' Cooper was able to graduate early this year because of OHSU 's competency-based curriculum , which allows students to complete their education based on mastery rather than checking off every item on the traditional four-year program . Over 100 other students also graduated on March 19 , about three months earlier than usual . Dr. George Mejicano , OHSU 's senior associate dean for education , says the timing was serendipitous . `` We were able to grant their degrees on that day , '' Mejicano said . `` And that was independent of COVID-19 . '' But not all recent graduates are able to start their residencies early , like Cooper . Mejicano says only facilities managed by OHSU -- such as Cascades East -- have been able to fast-track residency programs so far . Most medical students in OHSU 's graduating class this year are waiting to head out for residencies that begin this summer at hospitals across the country . Some are going to cities that have been or currently are COVID-19 epicenters , including Seattle , New York City and New Orleans . Zoe Teton , who also graduated early this year from OHSU , is slated to begin a residency at another coronavirus hotspot : The UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles . The virus has hit Los Angeles County particularly hard with over 6,000 confirmed cases and more than 150 deaths , according to county public health officials . The strain on the healthcare system there is especially prominent . Teton says she 's ready to fill in any healthcare gaps at her residency as needed . `` This is what we 're supposed to be doing and what we came here to do , '' she said . `` We 're raring to go . '' Even though Teton will be an intern in the neurosurgery program , she says this current public health emergency only pushes her drive to serve as many people as possible further . `` This is so much bigger than any one person or any one field , '' she said . `` It absolutely heightens that resolve to get out there and help our fellow humans . '' Meanwhile , Cooper has less than two weeks before she starts at Cascades East in Klamath Falls . What 's motivating her now , she said , is the idea that everyone has a role to play during this crisis . `` We 're seeing a lot of people step up and contribute whatever they can -- whether that be making masks , taking care of the older adults or offering discounted food . '' Cooper said . `` My role just happens to be something that 's more direct to patient care and I can draw inspiration from all of those other people .

US and European Doctors Start Testing !", "content": "Doctors from all around the world are trying to see if the gas that gave the world the ` little blue pill ' could actually help treat the novel coronavirus while it spreads and becomes even stronger ! This nitric oxide is known as a colorless gas that actually helps blood vessels dilate , which then in turn leads to an increasing amount of oxygen flowing through and around your body . How the Viagra gas has been used The gas has actually already been known to treat newborns experiencing heart defects and has also led to the development of the popular erectile dysfunction drug we all know as the Viagra ! For quite a number of years , doctors have been using different blends of this nitric oxide/oxygen blends in critical care in order to dilate blood vessels to be able to treat infants with different birth defects . Currently , scientists from three different states in the United States as well as three different European countries are trying out this drug to see if it can actually provide the needed oxygen to the starved blood vessels within the lungs and also spare patients from the need of ventilators . Nitric oxide has actually been more than just Viagra gas and was even found out to be so important that it received the name Molecule of the Year from the journal Science in 1992 . In 1998 , three different United States researchers actually won the Nobel Prize for the Physiology of Medicine `` For their discoveries concerning nitric oxide as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system . '' The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation or ECMO machine Nitric oxide is often times breathed in gas form as a last resort method right before a baby has to be put on an ECMO machine , which then pumps and also oxygenates a patient 's blood right outside the body that in turn allows the heart and lungs to rest . Other known uses of Nitric oxide is it being given to diabetes patients who are experiencing a low supply of this molecule which leads to vascular damage . In addition , the gas actually has a few antiviral properties against a few different types of coronavirus . This nitric oxide was previously tested and proven on patients back in the 2002-2003 pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome otherwise known as SARS , which is considered to be the cousin of this new virus . Will nitric oxide be effective ? According to Dr. Berra who is a critical-care specialist from the Massachusetts General Hospital and also the leader of this new drug trial in a statement to Boston Herald , `` It 's a pretty remarkable drug , '' even continuing with saying that `` It has a risk profile that is minimal . '' A new international clinical trial is actually now being overseen by the Mass General and also taking place at hospitals located in Alabama , Massachusetts , Louisiana , Italy , Austria , and even Sweden ! Coronavirus patients with only mild to moderate cases will start to inhale the nitric oxide through the CPAP machine for about 20 to 30 minutes a day , two times a day , for a whole two weeks .", "url": "https://www.itechpost.com/articles/102156/20200407/viagra-gas-coronavirus-treatment-european-doctors-start-testing.htm", "kws": ["Coronavirus^^patients", "Treatment", "diabetes^^patients", "Doctors", "Coronavirus", "Viagra", "pill", "blood^^vessels", "hospitals", "heart^^defects", "newborns", "Medicine", "erectile^^dysfunction", "birth^^defects", "oxygen", "gas^^form", "drug", "vascular^^damage", "infants", "Gas"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Health": 0.999921441078186}, "second_cat": {"Health_Other": 0.999921441078186}}}

He further suggested that everybody should have 1 % of their assets in bitcoin since it is `` a fantastic hedge . '' Bitcoin 's Price Could Reach $ 1 Million Chamath Palihapitiya , the chairman of Virgin Galactic and founder of investment firm Social Capital , recently discussed bitcoin and how to invest during the current financial crisis . In a podcast interview published last week with Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano , Palihapitiya was asked about his bitcoin investment strategy . Responding to questions about whether he had bought , sold or changed the bitcoin allocation in his portfolio in any way , the venture capitalist revealed : In 2013 , I bought a lot and at one point I think I had almost 5 % of all the bitcoins . My basis is about 80 bucks a coin . I 've never bought more . `` Most of my bitcoin now sits with a company and they use it for trading purposes . They use it to run a bunch of other strategies , '' he added . `` I did that mostly for safety and security and peace of mind . I did n't want to deal with it . I wanted to own equity in the business . That equity can be hedged . That equity can be tax structured advantageously , and then it allows them to run a big business which generates cash , and I can get a cash and dividend stream . '' He proceeded to confirm , `` so I have not bought since I initially basically wrote that article for Bloomberg in 2013 . '' Bitcoin is `` still a speculative instrument and it 's too speculative for it to be reliable , '' Palihapitiya opined . `` So if you are going to make the case that it should replace fiat currency , well one thing you have to look at is the volatility of the U.S. dollar and you ca n't replace it with something that 's nine sigmas more volatile . It does n't work . '' He then shared his prediction of how high he thinks the price of bitcoin could be over the next 10 years . `` It is a 10-year trajectory , '' he began . `` I 've always thought of bitcoin as a very binary investment , whether it goes from 80 to 8,000 to 6,000 to 3,000 to 13,000 , it does n't matter . '' Noting that bitcoin 's price will be `` either zero or it 's millions , '' Palihapitiya asserted : What it will do is it will create a quasi gold standard . It 'll create an index , except instead of having to own gold where gold is owned by central banks , it is an instrument that has value that 's determined in between its participants , and it 's owned by everybody . Palihapitiya has founded six companies and currently serves on the board of nine others , including Syapse Inc. and Remind101 . He also previously worked at Facebook , Mayfield Fund , AOL , and Winmap . Everyone Should Have Bitcoin Palihapitiya also discussed bitcoin investing in an interview with CNBC last month . The Virgin Galactic chairman reiterated that his view on bitcoin remained unchanged since he authored the Bloomberg article on the subject in 2013 , elaborating : Everybody should probably have 1 % of their assets in bitcoin specifically . I still believe that today and I think it -LSB- bitcoin -RSB- is just a fantastic hedge . When asked about his thoughts on what Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said about bitcoin , Palihapitiya emphasized that the billionaire `` is completely wrong and outdated on this point of view . '' Buffett insists that he does not own any bitcoin and never will . Repeatedly saying that it has zero value , he once called the cryptocurrency `` rat poison squared . '' Palihapitiya clarified to CNBC that investing in bitcoin should not be event-driven . `` When you wake up and you see a coronavirus scare and the Dow down 2,000 , you should not be going in and buying bitcoin -- that is an idiotic strategy , '' he opined . `` I think a reasonable strategy is to say 1 % of my net worth should be in something that is completely uncorrelated to the world and how the world works . '' The Virgin Galactic chairman suggested going into bitcoin `` quietly '' and letting the investment accumulate . He concluded , `` Then you just never look at it again and hope that that insurance under the mattress never has to come due , '' adding : But if it does , it will protect you because that thing will be hundreds of thousands or a million dollars a coin .

Recently , she shared a throwback photo of her June 1977 Cosmopolitan magazine cover . Apparently , the photo showed Christie in a controversial bikini . In the photo , Christie is dressed in a purple , silky-looking bathing suit with a very high cut . In the '70s , it was common for bikinis to be very low slung , so this style was fairly new and turned out to be controversial . She remembers feeling uncomfortable and appreciates how things have changed so more body styles are displayed on magazine covers . Christie Brinkley shares throwback photo of controversial bikini cover in 1977 She shares the story of the \u201977 bikini in her caption . She wrote , `` In 1977 this bathing suit caused a stir ! At the time all the bikinis were low slung on the hip . This high leg cut made the hip a new erogenous zone . I could n't figure out how to put it on as just one string holds it all together ! Francesco Scavullo shot all the covers for #cosmopolitan back then . He had a big umbrella with a string that ran from the middle of the umbrella which contained a light to the tip of your nose . You were in perfect light at the end of that string . They did not have retouching back then so they really perfected the makeup and every strand of hair . '' : 65-Year-Old Christie Brinkley Looks Stunning In Swimsuit Beside Her Two Daughters She worried that she looked fat in the photo Christie continued , `` I remember I was worried that I looked fat . I 'm so glad that today our industry appreciates all shapes and sizes so we can just focus on being healthy . Not cookie cutter . Still , there is something in some young girls that often makes them feel they just do n't measure up . I was one of them . I look back at these and think that worry was such a waste of time . If only the perspective we gain with age that alleviates the worries , could be passed on and absorbed by the younger generation ... but I do think shifting the focus to feeling great is a giant step in the right direction . Just thinking out loud as I sift thru a few photos . Wishing everyone a great day -LRB- and decade ! -RRB- # 1977 #kamali #swimsuit #cover #christiebrinkley #cosmo #confidence #bodyimage '' Over the years , Christie has talked about how she encourages her daughters to love their bodies . Her daughter Sailor has opened up about her body image struggles in the past . She praised Sports Illustrated for showing different bodies on their covers . She wrote in a post , `` I 've had issues with my body image since before I can even remember . I grew up not loving how I looked and felt held back because of it ... I do n't need to be a size 0 to believe in myself . My body carries me each and every day , it loves the people I love , it holds what makes me healthy and strong , it bends it shakes it runs and it CHANGES . That is okay and that is beautiful ...

MLB determined the Astros used a camera in center field to steal signs both during the regular and postseason . The league could have gone a variety of different directions with their penalties , but what they ultimately landed on was suspensions for general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager A.J. Hinch , a $ 5 million fine -LRB- the maximum allowed -RRB- , as well as the loss of first - and second-round picks in the 2020 and 2021 MLB Drafts . Astros owner Jim Crane then took his own action by firing Luhnow and Hinch . Notably , however , MLB decided not to strip the Astros of their championship or penalize any of the players that were involved . The organization that lost the most from both the Astros and Boston Red Sox stealing signs was the Los Angeles Dodgers as they fell to both teams in back-to-back trips to the World Series . Former Dodgers player David Freese , who retired at the conclusion of the 2019 season , took to social media to commend MLB 's punishments while also calling on them to strip the Astros of their title : Did n't really expect the punishments to be this harsh . Good for MLB stepping up . Still do n't know what 's more frustrating tho , an ex teammate of the WS title team talking publicly about his team cheating or so many guys being down to use a damn trash can lol . Should take the ring -- David Freese -LRB- @david23freese -RRB- January 13 , 2020 Freese won a World Series with the St. Louis Cardinals in 2011 and was named the MVP , so he certainly knows what it takes to win while doing things the right way . He was not with the Dodgers when they lost to the Astros in 2017 , but he was a part of the 2018 team that was defeated by the Red Sox . It will be interesting to see if these penalties are harsh enough to detract teams for stealing signs in the future , or if this slap on the wrist only creates an even bigger problem moving forward . The Red Sox took action by mutually agreeing to part ways with Cora as manager . Though that is not expected to have an impact on MLB 's ongoing investigation .

The cleanups resumed this week . CBS4 's Jacqueline Quynh talked with those at Samaritan House and its donation warehouse manager to find out how the encampment cleanups are affecting them . `` I struggled with a lot of things you know , cause I could n't carry a lot of things with me , '' Debbie Steins said . Steins is a volunteer and participant at the Samaritan House , a shelter that helps people in transition . `` I got homeless because my friend died and I was n't on the lease , '' she said . Steins explains , because she has a disability , she 's also on a fixed income and it 's simply not enough to afford rent close by in Denver . She was out on the street last September before coming to Samaritan House . `` It 's your feet you know , you 're walking on them constantly . '' In the time she 's had to sleep on sidewalks , she 's learned how important it is to have a good pair of socks . That 's part of the reason she came into the shelter , to stock up on personal goods . `` Just a pair of socks can be the beginning for somebody , '' Jennifer Marnowski , Footprints to Recovery specialist said . This is all part of the reason why , for the third year in a row , Footprints to Recovery , an addiction treatment center in Centennial has organized the `` Socks of Love '' campaign to collect 10,000 pairs for Samaritan House . And there may not be a greater need for more socks , along with other personal dry goods . `` The thing that we need every day is that freshness , '' Robert Bigsby , Catholic Charities Donations Manager said . Bigsby manages apparel and supplies that are given to the shelter . `` Here we 've got socks , different sizes , underwear , '' Bigsby pointed to the sorted donations . The need for goods he explained has always been great , now he 's worried about people being displaced by the urban camping enforcement , and how it may drive more people to his shelters , which means , he 'll need even more donations . `` People do n't just decide to be here , sometimes their circumstances bring them here , '' Bigsby added . Of course , some do n't want the help , but people like Steins are grateful . `` The socks mean the world to me , '' Steins said . It 's not too late to donate to the Socks of Love Campaign or drop off donations to the Catholic Charities Donation Center at 2301 Lawrence Street .

He was handing out flyers inside the Capitol that read : `` We are wasting money and failing to reverse Missouri 's overdose epidemic . '' Presnall had graphics , bullet points and arguments to share that he 'd sharpened as a researcher at Washington University and a clinician at Clayton Behavioral . Unexpectedly , he made it all the way to the House Health and Mental Health Policy Committee that day , where , he said , he went on to testify for 45 minutes about how medication-assisted treatment is effective at saving lives but underused . He testified that the state-funded network of traditional substance abuse treatment centers , which mainly rely on counseling and group therapies , had a `` monopoly '' and little incentive to provide `` effective or cost-effective care , '' such as prescribing buprenorphine or methadone to control painful withdrawal symptoms . That caused fallout . But not long after , Presnall was hired as a consultant to the state on addiction-related matters . He helped develop and teach the medication-first model in Missouri as part of a $ 65 million opioid response grant . That position ended Monday , when Rachel Winograd , the grant director , fired him . Presnall , 43 , of Kirkwood had finally said too much . `` There comes a time when , with really smart advocates like Ned , it needs to be decided where they will be most effective with their advocacy -- inside a system or outside of it , '' said Winograd , of the Missouri Institute of Mental Health at the University of Missouri-St . Louis . `` Right now my team is working inside the system to make changes with a variety of stakeholders . Maintaining those relationships is critical . '' Last weekend , Presnall was quoted in an in-depth Post-Dispatch report that profiled Jordan Valley Community Health Center in Springfield , one of only two clinics in Missouri that treat people addicted to opioids on a walk-in basis with medication and access to wraparound services . ` A different way ' : Walk-in clinic sees success treating opioid addicts with medication Rather than wait for a better state and federal response , Jordan Valley Community Health Center in Springfield , Missouri , came up with its own . And it appears to be working . Including a link to the story , Presnall wrote on Twitter that opioid use disorder funding should be directed to federally qualified health care centers such as Jordan Valley and other primary care settings instead of the state 's network of existing substance use treatment providers . `` The uninsured , '' Presnall said via Twitter , `` are usually relegated to counseling programs with a political lock on -LRB- opioid use disorder -RRB- funding and with perverse financial incentives to offering counseling instead of medicine . '' In Missouri , we need to direct OUD treatment dollars to primary care . The uninsured are usually relegated to counseling programs with a political lock on OUD funding and with perverse financial incentives to offer counseling instead of medicine . https://t.co/VyGqvYsmFf -- Ned Presnall -LRB- @NedPresnall -RRB- January 11 , 2020 Mark Schwartz , a lobbyist who oversees governmental affairs for the Coalition for Community Behavioral Healthcare , briefly weighed in by asking Presnall for specifics . Presnall responded with a 27-point thread about how traditional drug treatment agencies were n't best equipped to respond to the epidemic and essentially costing lives . Studies , including one that Presnall co-authored , have shown that patients stay in treatment longest when they are treated with medication in doctors ' offices , not traditional drug treatment centers . Yet primary care facilities were n't targeted with any of the funding from the $ 65 million grant . `` The system is designed to protect the flow of money even when changing the flow would be in the best interest of patients , '' Presnall wrote . `` There 's never been a time in our country 's history when it 's been more imperative that we change the way -LRB- substance use treatment -RRB- is funded and delivered . '' On Monday , Presnall was on Twitter once again , announcing that he 'd been dismissed from his role with the statewide opioid response team . `` You can say a lot of things on Twitter but do n't analyze the flow of money or call out the established interests that carefully protect it , '' he wrote . 1/6 Yesterday I was dismissed from Missouri 's SOR training and consultation team by Department of Mental Health leadership -LRB- good people / bad system -RRB- for posting this thread : https://t.co/BwP8V0GNYT You can say a lot of things on Twitter but do n't analyze the flow of money -- Ned Presnall -LRB- @NedPresnall -RRB- January 14 , 2020 Later , he told the Post-Dispatch that politics was the tail wagging the dog at the Department of Mental Health , which oversees the opioid response grant and funding for many traditional drug treatment centers . Schwartz forwarded a call for comment to Brent McGinty , president of the coalition , who said he 'd complained this week about Presnall 's Twitter comments to Mark Stringer , director of the Department of Mental Health and other top leaders of the agency . McGinty said the coalition has had concerns `` over the years '' with `` several aspects '' of the state opioid response grant , mainly regarding how the money is spent . `` We feel like we have been national leaders in -LRB- medication-assisted treatment -RRB- , '' McGinty said . `` We certainly agree that we need to be moving more that way , but certainly there is a bit of disagreement about other services needing to be included in part of that treatment array . '' He said providers are already underfunded and trying to treat numerous addictions -- meth , alcohol , opioids . `` We are all in it for the same reasons , '' McGinty said . `` We are doing our best to work in an underfunded system to save lives and promote recovery and serve our communities . '' On Wednesday , Stringer said in an interview that the state network of traditional drug treatment centers needs more funding , not less . `` You know what is sad is that we agree on so many things , Ned and me and my team , '' Stringer said . `` I personally just ca n't tolerate a message that says let 's take money from here and put it over here when this system is starving . '' He said he agreed with Presnall 's point that there are financial incentives in the state system that have n't kept up with the evidence-based practices of medication-assisted treatment . He said he hopes that in the next 10 to 15 years more opioid addicts will be treated in primary care settings . `` But right now , '' he said , `` a lot of those places do n't want to see our folks and a lot of our folks are uninsured . '' There is more at stake than the $ 65 million opioid response grant . Many more addicts are dying and more money is likely coming to address the need . Missouri opioid experts prioritize expenditures in anticipation of Big Pharma settlement money Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt listened to their suggestions at a roundtable in St. Louis . At a listening tour in November about the opioid epidemic , Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt estimated that `` tens of millions of dollars '' could come to Missouri within the next few years from a potential settlement windfall from lawsuits against opioid painkiller companies that allegedly misrepresented the addictive nature of the prescription drugs . Presnall was part of the tour stop in St. Louis . He advocated for the integration of medications into the treatment of opioid use disorder . Stringer , also in attendance , pitched a bigger tent . `` When and if we get the funds , we need to get them out in the most effective way possible , and that will include prevention services , treatment services , recovery services , '' Stringer said then . `` Certainly the use of medications in treating people with opioid use disorders .

Daniel Christopher French , 48 , pleaded guilty to felony sexual abuse of children . He appeared with attorney Buddy Rutzke in Gallatin County District Court before Judge John Brown . Prosecutors will recommend at his sentencing on April 8 that French serve 10 years in the Montana State Prison , with four years suspended , and that he complete sex offender treatment . Prosecutors will also recommend that French have no unsupervised contact with people under 18 and that there be no parole restrictions on his sentence . French is allowed to make his own sentence recommendation . In 2018 , Yahoo Inc. provided multiple tips to a Bozeman detective that a user had uploaded photos of child pornography to Flickr on several occasions , according to charging documents . The detective found that an account connected to French uploaded 106 photos of girls ages 6 to 14 engaged in sexually explicit conduct . In December 2018 , the detective and a Department of Homeland Security Investigations agent found French living in his car in the Walmart parking lot , court documents say . French told the officers he was doing his own investigation into child porn because he was accused of molesting a child in Idaho , court documents say . An officer later called law enforcement in Pocatello and confirmed `` suspicious behavior '' between French and children . Police said in charging documents that French 's cellphone had 1,026 images of girls ages 7 to 17 years old either naked or performing sexual acts .

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , in remarks on the Senate floor , invited the House managers to the Senate at noon on Thursday to exhibit the articles . The trial is set for Tuesday . In his remarks , McConnell said , `` This is a difficult time for our country , but this is precisely the kind of time for which the framers created the Senate . I 'm confident this body can rise above short term-ism and factional fever and serve the long-term interests of our nation . '' On Tuesday , McConnell laid out how the trial will progress . He said the Senate will hear arguments by the parties , conduct a written question period , and then address what he called `` the more contentious issue of witnesses . '' CBS News associate producer Eleanor Watson notes that Republican senators Susan Collins , Mitt Romney , and Lisa Murkowski have indicated they would like a chance to vote on hearing from witnesses after hearing the arguments . They have not committed to voting for witnesses , but would like the option to once they hear the arguments . If these three Republicans join all Democrats in voting to subpoena witnesses , then they 'd only need one more Republican to join them to summon witnesses the House did not hear from . Democrats have asked to hear from four government witnesses , including Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton . McConnell warned Democrats on Tuesday that he `` could n't imagine that only the witnesses that our Democratic colleagues would want to call would be called . '' FROM THE CANDIDATES BERNIE SANDERS & ELIZABETH WARREN Since that awkward rebuffed handshake following Tuesday night 's debate , we have not heard much from Senators Bernie Sanders , Elizabeth Warren or their campaigns , note CBS News campaign reporters Cara Korte and Zak Hudak . Reporters caught Sanders on Capitol Hill this afternoon and asked what was said between he and Warren . Sanders joked , `` The weather . '' The most robust response came from Sanders most trusted advisor , his wife Jane O'Meara Sanders , who spoke to the AP Wednesday afternoon . `` We remain committed to continuing a progressive movement made up of women and men , black and white , gay and straight , '' she said . `` Maybe people sometimes misremember things that happened , '' she added . `` But I know without a doubt that it is not anything Bernie would ever say . It is inconceivable because it 's not what he believes . And there 's proof of that going back many , many years . '' How serious should we take O'Meara Sanders ' certainty ? Her son , Dave Driscoll , weighed in on Twitter : `` I 've heard my Mom say this only a handful of times before ` This discussion is over ' ... we should all listen . '' If Driscoll is right , do n't expect Sanders or his team to bring up this spat anytime soon . But know that Sanders will be back on the trail this weekend in New Hampshire , and with two town halls scheduled , we 'll wait to see if voters ask him about Warren . STATE-BY-STATE NEVADA Tom Steyer , Pete Buttigieg , Joe Biden , Elizabeth Warren , and Tulsi Gabbard were among those to appear Wednesday at the Native American Presidential Forum in Las Vegas , hosted by Four Directions Vote and the Nevada Tribal Nations . The group sought commitments on issues facing Native Americans , from addressing a crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women to revoking the military honors given to American soldiers who participated in the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee . CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin reports Steyer was the only candidate to speak in person at the event , which struggled to book appearances after the Democratic National Committee scheduled a debate in Iowa for the day prior . Others appeared remotely , with some sending surrogates in addition to pre-recording interviews or appearing via a livestream . SOUTH CAROLINA As healthcare continues to surface as one of the top issues on voters ' minds in South Carolina , non-profit organization Medicare for ALL NOW ! has launched five new digital ads promoting M4A . The ads are the first phase of a planned six-figure campaign aimed at pitching South Carolina voters on Medicare for All , while advocating for a single-payer health care system across the country . The Philadelphia-based group has hired 20 South Carolinians to begin mobilizing volunteers on the ground in five counties throughout the state . Kerri Evelyn Harris , Movement Director for the group , tells CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell that the team strategically chose South Carolina to focus on voters of color in large part because it 's one of the states that will choose the Democratic nominee . When asked , Harris added that although former Vice President Joe Biden has remained popular in the state throughout this primary cycle -- and is not a proponent of Medicare for All -- she thinks this message will still resonate with South Carolina voters . `` Obamacare is something that we are to build , it was a starting point and expanding access is not enough . Access does n't allow you to actually pay your bills , '' said Harris . `` It does n't allow you to actually afford to go to the doctor , it just says there 's a doctor available . We have to make sure that people actually receive health care and that 's the next step and that 's what Medicare for All will do . '' South Carolina is one of 14 states that has n't expanded Medicaid . LIFE AFTER THE TRAIL CORY BOOKER Nearly a year after launching his presidential bid , Senator Cory Booker suspended his campaign this week as the Democratic Party faces renewed criticism for the lack of diversity among its presidential candidates . While Booker 's South Carolina operation stayed at around 20 paid staffers throughout his time on the trail , the New Jersey senator had made the first-in-the-South primary state a priority early on and made 16 visits to the state after launching his candidacy -- the most of any candidate . Even before officially announcing his bid , Booker had started to court voters in the Palmetto State . In 2018 , he was the keynote speaker at the Betty Henderson Elected Officials and Candidates Cook-Off , a flagship event for one of the state 's Democratic Party 's chapters . And last year Booker participated in another staple event in the state , `` King Day at the Dome , '' a week ahead of announcing his bid for the presidency . On the heels of the first Democratic debate of the year , which featured no candidates of color , Mitchell reports that South Carolina state Representative Annie McDaniel , a vocal Booker supporter , said that his run was important in part because of the diversity he brought to the race . `` It 's always important when we have elections and when things are occurring in America that involve diversity , that we have diversity , '' said McDaniel . `` It 's a shame that the DNC put so much pressure on candidates to raise money , raise money , raise money , raise money , and we talk about Trump being a billionaire and having no sensitivity , then why is it that we as Democrats are putting so much attention and so much focus on who can raise the money ? '' CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE IN THE HOUSE Connecticut GOP Chair J.R. Romano has asked congressional candidate Robert Hyde to end his campaign . The move came after Hyde 's name and messages were unveiled in some new documents released by the House Intelligence Committee , reports CBS News broadcast associate Aaron Navarro . In the documents , Hyde , a Trump donor , talked to Rudy Giuliani 's former business associate Lev Parnas about tracking down U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch 's locations . `` She 's talked to three people . Her phone is off . Her computer is off , '' Hyde said in one revealed message and said in another that he had relevant Ukraine associates . Hyde was looking to unseat Democrat Representative Jahana Hayes , and was one of four Republicans who had filed to run for the seat . In a Wednesday Twitter post , Romano called Hyde 's bid `` a distraction for the Democrats to raise money and falsely label all Republicans with his antics . In my view he is not helping other Republican candidates or @realDonaldTrump win . '' In a response , Hyde said Romano should `` resign from the @CTGOP ASAP . Never did anything but rig elections including his own and was a staunch advocate against @realDonaldTrump and still is . '' Romano had previously criticized Hyde for his crude , now-deleted tweets about Senator Kamala Harris . Meanwhile , Arizona Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick announced Wednesday that she would be taking a leave from office to seek treatment for an alcohol dependence . In her statement , she said she had a serious fall last week , and wanted to face the `` underlying cause '' of that accident . `` I am finally seeking this help after struggling to do so in the past , and I am ready to admit that I , like countless other Americans , suffer from this disease . Hard work and determination -- which have brought me success in life -- have not been enough to win this battle . Other than being a wife , mother , and grandmother , the most important job in the world to me is representing my fellow Arizonans . I know I must get better in order to do my best in each of these roles , '' Kirkpatrick wrote in a statement . Per the statement , Kirkpatrick 's office will still be `` fully operational '' and that her positions on votes will be submitted to Congressional Record . Kirkpatrick , a Democrat , represents a slightly competitive district in Southeastern Arizona , and won by five points in 2018 after previously serving in another district from 2012 to 2014 . The Cook Political Report rates the race as `` likely Democratic . '' One of her Republican challengers , Shay Stautz , tweeted out his support to Kirkpatrick earlier Wednesday . `` We should all recognize it takes guts to ask for help when you need it , '' Stautz said . Another candidate , Brandon Martin , shared his support on Facebook and said he is `` happy to hear , Mrs. Kirkpatrick , is seeking professional help to combat her illness and is taking the steps necessary to recover . I wish her , and her family the best as she begins her journey to a full recovery .

The BBC discovered the issue and that prompted the tech firm to act . Our investigation found it possible to target users who had shown an interest in keywords including `` transphobic '' , `` white supremacists '' and `` anti-gay '' . Twitter allows ads to be directed at users who have posted about or searched for specific topics . But the firm has now said it is sorry for failing to exclude discriminatory terms . Anti-hate charities had raised concerns that the US tech company 's advertising platform could have been used to spread intolerance . What exactly was the problem ? Like many social media companies , Twitter creates detailed profiles of its users by collecting data on the things they post , like , watch and share . They can also control who sees their message by using keywords . Twitter gives the advertiser an estimate for how many users are likely to qualify as a result . For example , a car website wanting to reach people using the term `` petrolhead '' would be told that the potential audience is between 140,000 and 172,000 people . Twitter 's keywords were supposed to be restricted . But our tests showed that it was possible to advertise to people using the term `` neo-Nazi '' . The ad tool had indicated that in the UK , this would target a potential audience of 67,000 to 81,000 people . Other more offensive terms were also an option . How did the BBC test this ? We created a generic advert from an anonymous Twitter account , saying `` Happy New Year '' . We then targeted three different audiences based on sensitive keywords . Twitter 's website said that ads on its platform would be reviewed prior to being launched , and the BBC 's ad initially went into a `` pending '' state . But soon afterwards , it was approved and ran for a few hours until we stopped it . In that time , 37 users saw the post and two of them clicked on a link attached , which directed them to a news article about memes . Running the ad cost # 3.84 . Targeting an advert using other problematic keywords seemed to be just as easy to do . A campaign using the keywords `` islamophobes '' , `` islamaphobia '' , `` islamophobic '' and ' #islamophobic ' had a potential to reach 92,900 to 114,000 Twitter users , according to Twitter 's tool . We ran the same advert to an audience of 13 to 24-year-olds using the keywords `` anorexic '' , `` bulimic '' , `` anorexia '' and `` bulimia '' . Twitter estimated the target audience amounted to 20,000 people . The post was seen by 255 users , and 14 people clicked on the link before we stopped it . What did campaigners say ? Hope Not Hate , an anti-extremism charity , said it feared that Twitter 's ads could become a propaganda tool for the far-right . `` I can see this being used to promote engagement and deepen the conviction of individuals who have indicated some or partial agreement with intolerant causes or ideas , '' said Patrik Hermansson , its social media researcher . The eating disorder charity Anorexia and Bulimia Care added that it believed the ad tool had already been abused . `` I 've been talking about my eating disorder on social media for a few years now and been targeted many times with adverts based on dietary supplements , weight loss supplements , spinal corrective surgery , '' said Daniel Magson , the organisation 's chairman . `` It 's quite triggering for me , and I 'm campaigning to get it stopped through Parliament . So , it 's great news that Twitter has now acted . '' What did Twitter say ? The social network said it had policies in place to avoid the abuse of keyword targeting , but acknowledged they had not been applied correctly . '' -LSB- Our -RSB- preventative measures include banning certain sensitive or discriminatory terms , which we update on a continuous basis , '' it said in a statement . `` In this instance , some of these terms were permitted for targeting purposes . This was an error . `` We 're very sorry this happened and as soon as we were made aware of the issue , we rectified it . `` We continue to enforce our ads policies , including restricting the promotion of content in a wide range of areas , including inappropriate content targeting minors .

You 'd think that splashing out for the Porsche Taycan Turbo S would deliver some extra range in addition to the improved acceleration -LRB- as you get with rivals like Tesla -RRB- , but that 's apparently not the case . The EPA has rated the top-spec model 's range at just 192 miles -- that 's less than the already modest 201 miles of the regular Turbo . Given that the Turbo S currently starts at $ 188,960 after delivery and handling fees , you 're not getting much longevity for the money . For context , the current Tesla Model S Performance sells for $ 99,990 with slightly faster acceleration -LRB- 0-60MPH in 2.4 seconds versus 2.6 -RRB- and an EPA-estimated 348-mile range . There are still reasons you 'd consider the Taycan over the Model S , and not just for that Porsche badging . The Taycan may not be quite as fast , but it delivers more sustainable performance . You can thrash around the track or drag strip for a long time without losing your edge . Our early testing suggests there 's nimbler handling , too . And while you can get some posh interior options for the Model S , there 's little doubt that the Taycan has a fancier cabin with perks like Apple CarPlay . Still , range is range .

This is , in my opinion , nothing like being on television . There is a little more added pressure because we 're a sales company and we want to sell these horses and do a good job for the consignors who work so hard as well . With TV , I 'm obviously representing the company I work for with TVG , but here , you 're representing the sales company and the consignors so we try to do a really good job . `` I know the type of show that Keeneland puts out . This is the best auction team in the world so that put a lot of added pressure on everything . I want to do my Keeneland family proud but at the same time this is a world-class auction team . I 'm very happy that we got one underneath the belt . '' With the timber of her voice may have been of a softer tone than many auction goers are accustomed to , Gaudet never wavered in her two shifts at the microphone , employing her elocution skills with enviable aplomb . `` It 's a proud day for us because to have the first female to work a major Thoroughbred auction in North America is something Keeneland was very interested in , '' said Keeneland 's vice president of racing and sales Bob Elliston . `` We want to bring opportunities for all people in our workforce and to bring a talent like Gabby , who has already demonstrated what she 's capable of -- it 's a very special day . '' The idea to send the popular analyst to the podium was first suggested following the Keeneland November Breeding Stock sale , when Gaudet said she was approached by veteran Keeneland auction team member Kurt Becker , who also doubles as Keeneland 's resident track announcer . `` Kurt asked if it would be something I would be interested in , '' said Gaudet . `` It was never really something I had thought about or considered . He said , ` We 're familiar with you obviously working the Keeneland simulcast and I think you would fit into the Keeneland auction team ' . One thing led to another and we communicated back and forth and decided that for this sale I would do two different sets of hips on Wednesday . '' With the date and time set for her debut , Gaudet said the pressure was on to make sure she was never out of step with the team that operates the world 's largest Thoroughbred auction house like a well-oiled machine . `` It 's different types of preparation , '' said Gaudet . `` I really want to give a lot of credit to this auction team because they have taken me in and helped me so much the past couple of days . We did a couple of dry rehearsals during the off hours of the sale and everyone gave me pointers . `` The first point in preparation was about being around the auction team and being able to observe and see how they do their job . The second point was that you really want to keep up to date with recent winners , maiden winners , stakes winners , and updates so I did my research there and I tried to connect the dots with the pedigree page . '' The most challenging part said Gaudet , was learning how to keep one 's composure while being bombarded by new information on the stand . `` You have a lot of papers you 're fiddling around with and sometimes there are late outs or late updates and there is a lot of information that you ca n't always prepare for ahead of time , '' said Gaudet . `` That was the most nerve-wracking . It 's an orchestra . We 're dancing dances up there and you have to be quick and concise and have energy . '' `` I would say at its core why I think she 's done so well is that she 's very capable but she 's also passionate about horse racing and breeding , '' said Elliston , who praised Gaudet 's breadth of knowledge about the industry as a whole . `` She knows the subject matter , so I 'm not shocked that she was great . '' `` I 'm aware of prominent national Thoroughbred folks who have been on TV a lot who have tried it and could n't do it . It gives you a shot to be good at it but you have to be as capable as she is when you 're up there and really know the subject matter . She did it and it 's a great day for us here at Keeneland . '' But as the patrons left the pavilion as the final horse left the ring , the flood of support for Gaudet -- both online and inside the auction house -- resounded like the fall of the final hammer . Confident in the knowledge that she had done her job well , Gaudet said the historical enormity of the moment is one that she wo n't soon forget and hopes to repeat in the Spring when Keeneland hosts the April 2-Year-Olds in Training and Horses of Racing Age Sale . `` Obviously I 'm very proud , '' said Gaudet . `` I 'm also very grateful for the people at Keeneland , Bill Thomason and Bob Elliston , who hit the ` Yes ' button and let me have the opportunity to do this once the idea was conceived by Kurt Becker . I 'm incredibly proud . It was a lot of fun .

The Colorado Avalanche do not have a great track record when it comes to their annual Pride Night . Last year 's was barely an event at all , and I hope that the organisation can learn from that and grow . As a member of the LGBTQ community myself , I have a vested interest in seeing Pride Night done well . Hockey is not exactly known for embracing the diverse . The players , coaching staff and management are by and large white , male and heterosexual . Even with the initiative from the NHL to have a month dedicated to inclusivity some teams in the go all in , but others do the bare minimum and sometimes even less than that . I honestly find the whole thing quite baffling . With various events and theme nights throughout the year why is this the one that gets ignored ? If I were to hazard a guess I 'd say that teams do n't want to rock the boat . But , the thing is , change does n't happen unless you do exactly that . Hockey will never be for everyone unless every team in the NHL makes it clear that that 's what they want . There are a few simple things the Avalanche could do to elevate their Pride Night and show their fans that they do actually care and want to welcome and include them . Promote the Event It sounds obvious , but Hockey Is For Everyone month starts in just over two weeks and we still do n't know when the Avalanche are holding their Pride night . It does n't need to be a fanfare from the ramparts kind of announcement but sharing the date gives fans time to plan and purchase their tickets . At this moment in time there 's nothing about it on the team 's events page , just a listing for Date Night on Feb 13th . It 's difficult to demonstrate how popular an event is if no one knows about it . Make Pride Night About Pride Hockey Is For Everyone has a whole month dedicated to it . There is no need for teams to have an all encompassing Hockey Is For Everyone night that they use to blanket cover all minority groups . It does a disservice to everyone if they all have to share the spotlight in order to be awarded a few crumbs . Spread things out over the month and have a few different nights for different groups . Show people that they matter and are n't just being used to fulfill the minimum requirements set out by the NHL . Talk to the LGBTQ Community It 's easy enough for me to sit here in the UK and make suggestions for what the team could do to improve their Pride night , but the people they should be talking to and listening to are the people they claim to want to support . Talk to the local LGBTQ community , ask them what you can do to help them , ask them what you can do to make hockey more inclusive both for players and for spectators . Listening is such an important part of making any event successful , and it 's even more important when you 're representing a minority group . Bring LGBTQ youth to the game , show them that hockey can be a fun and inclusive experience . Use Your Words The biggest way to reduce stigma , as with any initiative , is to talk about it . Get the players to talk about the importance of You Can Play , about the people they 've met while talking to members of the LGBTQ community . Get the players to outright say that homophobia has no place in hockey . I can not stress the importance of that last point enough . Homophobia will continue to be prevalent in hockey as long as people do n't openly speak out against it . Get the players to talk about it in the pregame , intermission and postgame interviews . Show the people watching that this is a cause that matters to them . In short : Be more like Mark Borowiecki View this post on Instagram -- Shoutout to @capitals and caps fans . Saw lots of great support for @pride in the crowd during warmups . Break it down and ice hockey is just a bunch of ugly dudes slapping a piece of rubber around ... but when we use the game as a way to show support for causes we believe in , it can become something more . A post shared by mark borowiecki -LRB- @itsborocoprunning -RRB- on Jan 7 , 2020 at 7:36 pm PST Cover The Spectrum Pride night should be more than just an event for gay and lesbian members of the community . There are other letters under the LGBTQ umbrella and they should be included too . Pride is n't just about who people love , it 's about gender identity as well . Trans people are among the most harassed and vulnerable members of the LGBTQ community . Include them , show them they are valid and welcome . Offer Support Recently the New Jersey Devils held their Pride night and featured a video about a young trans player . They closely monitored the comments and hid anything that was hateful or bigoted . No , this is not ` censorship ' or the denial of free speech , it 's about protecting the members of our community who need words of support not words of hatred . Trans youth have among the highest suicide rates of any minority group and we have a responsibility to show them that this is a safe environment for them . The @NJDevils social media team is working hard to make sure comments full of bigotry and hate are n't featured . Love and support only . @ all other nhl teams : take note , this is how it 's done https://t.co/xVgBOoKVGB pic.twitter.com/cSxpAKRwWD -- Get Latkes Deep Ferda Boys -LRB- @KuzyBeCackling -RRB- January 5 , 2020 Make Pride Tape or Pride Jerseys Mandatory During Warmups This may seem a little extreme , but none of the other theme nights are optional . Every single player wears the themed jersey on Military Appreciation Night , or Hockey Fights Cancer Night . Why is Pride night any different ? Players being given the choice about whether to participate or not it sends the message that supporting the LGBTQ community is n't as important . I 'm sure the argument will be made that players should n't be forced to support something they do n't believe in . Well , here 's a newsflash . Being LGBTQ is n't a ` lifestyle choice ' . It 's just something that you are . Whether someone believes in it or not is irrelevant . Saying you do n't believe in the LGBTQ ` lifestyle ' is like saying you do n't believe in people with red hair . If players have to support the military regardless of their feelings on the matter , they can wear a Pride jersey or use Pride tape for 20 minutes for one game . After last year 's lackluster Pride night I 'm not expecting any miracles this year . Even if the team takes on just some of the suggestions outlined here it will be a huge step in the right direction . I will say that despite the incredibly disappointing Pride night the team did make up for it a little with their attendance at Denver Pride last year . I hope that 's a sign that the organisation is moving forward but only time will tell .", "url": "https://milehighsticking.com/2020/01/15/colorado-avalanche-what-would-make-a-good-pride-night/", "kws": ["Colorado^^Avalanche", "Denver^^Pride", "Pride^^Hockey", "Pride^^Night", "ice^^hockey", "NHL", "Hockey", "Everyone^^night", "Pride^^Jerseys^^Mandatory", "Pride^^tape", "caps^^fans", "Bring^^LGBTQ^^youth", "LGBTQ", "Everyone^^month", "Military^^Appreciation^^Night", "theme^^nights", "warmups", "coaching^^staff", "ugly^^dudes", "Date^^Night"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Society": 0.9588605165481567}, "second_cat": {"Society_Other": 0.9588605165481567}}}

The bill creates a registry to track Massachusetts caregivers who are credibly found to have mentally , emotionally or financially abused people with disabilities . It also includes an appeal process for caregivers accused of abuse with some differences between the House and Senate 's versions . The Senate unanimously passed its version of the bill in October . Now the House and Senate must agree to a consensus bill before it goes to Gov. Charlie Baker 's desk . The bill , sponsored by Sen. Michael Moore , a Millbury Democrat , and Rep. Linda Campbell , a Methuen Democrat , is named Nicky 's Law after Nicky Chan . Nicky Chan was beaten several years ago while at a day program for people with intellectual disabilities , his mother testified last year . His mother , Cheryl Chan , said that she learned about the abuse from the state 's Disabled Persons Protection Commission . The alleged abuser was fired from the program and prosecuted , but he was found not guilty at trial . Under Nicky 's Law , the Disabled Persons Protection Commission would place a caretaker facing a credible allegation of abuse on a registry , which would include the caretaker 's name and date of birth . The registry would be hosted on the commission 's website . Rita Gardner , president of the board of directors at Massachusetts Association of Approved Private Schools , called the bill 's passage in the House a victory for the state . `` Students who attend MAAPS member schools include students who may be non-verbal and medically fragile , '' said Gardner , president and CEO of Melmark New England , a school system that serves students with intellectual disabilities . `` The Massachusetts Legislature has time and time again shown its support for our most vulnerable populations . '' MassLive reported in December that employees of a Guidewire group home in Springfield racked up allegations of misconduct that ranged from running a fight club in 2011 to raping a resident in 2015 . Eight employees were fired following the reports of the fights , according to the state Department of Developmental Services . In 2018 , the employees were given the right to return to work at facilities funded by the department . No criminal charges were filed . Michael Long , a nighttime caregiver accused of raping a resident in 2015 , was arrested on charges related to the incident but worked for another human services provider while his case was pending . He worked for ServiceNet from May 2016 until October 2017 . Long pleaded guilty to two counts of rape and two counts of indecent assault and battery on a person with an intellectual disability . He was sentenced in January 2019 to five to seven and a half years in state prison . Twenty-six states have an abuse registry , according to the National Adult Protective Services Association . Under the bill , state must notify a caregiver facing credible allegations that the person will be named in the registry . The caregiver has the right to appeal the decision to be added to the registry . The Senate version of the bill gave alleged abusers 10 days from the day they 're given notice about the registry to file an appeal . The House version tweaked the language to make sure the caregivers get 10 business days to make sure those who want to fight allegations have enough time to submit an appeal . The House version also states that if a caregiver appeals within 10 business days , the commission must hold off on adding the caregiver 's name until the appeal is reviewed by the Disabled Persons Protection Commission . The commission would be expected to notify the Department of Developmental Services , the caregiver 's employer , the victim and , if applicable , the victim 's guardian , of the results of the appeal . `` There are so many good caretakers out there and it 's a very difficult , exhausting job , both physically and emotionally , '' said Campbell , one of the bill 's sponsors . `` Most of these people are extraordinarily good people who provide a good service to our fellow human beings . We want to make sure that people continue to go into this field because we need more , and we want to take care of the ones that are in the field now . '' House Speaker Robert DeLeo told reporters that lawmakers were able to strike a balance between protecting vulnerable residents and making sure caregivers have due process if they face an allegation . `` The bill , I think , today does provide that protection ... at the same time providing legal protection , the due process , for those who are being accused , '' said DeLeo , a Winthrop Democrat . The registry would only be shared with potential employers , who would be required to check the registry before hiring someone . The Department of Developmental Services and any state-licensed care provider would not be allowed to hire anyone on the registry . Caregivers can also petition to have their names removed from the registry after five years . Only a fraction of caregivers accused of abusing people with disabilities leads to criminal charges . In fiscal 2016 , the state reviewed 9,449 abuse allegations and referred 1,536 to local prosecutors , according to the annual Disabled Persons Protection Commission 's annual report . In fiscal 2017 , the state reviewed 11,395 abuse allegations and referred 1,478 to local prosecutors . About 101 referrals in 2016 and 102 referrals in 2017 led to criminal charges , though the commission said the statistics on criminal charges are fluid and can vary . In fiscal 2018 , the state reviewed 11,900 abuse allegations and referred 1,698 reports to local prosecutors . Those referrals led to roughly 133 criminal charges by the time the 2018 annual report was released . In fiscal 2019 , the state reviewed 13,102 abuse allegations and referred 2,214 to local prosecutors . The commission 's report did not say how many led to criminal charges .

WWE is saddened to learn that WWE Hall of Famer Rocky Johnson has passed away . https://t.co/9uxrICJKxb -- WWE -LRB- @WWE -RRB- January 15 , 2020 Known as Rocky `` Soul Man '' Johnson , the wrestler 's birth name was Wayde Douglas Bowles . Together , he and partner Tony Atlas made up the Soul Patrol , the first African-American World Tag Team Champions in WWE history . According to WWE , he made his debut in the ring in 1983 and retired in 1991 , but stayed involved with the sport as he coached his son . In 2008 , he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame . Over the years , son Dwayne , 47 , shared all kinds of tributes to his old man . In December 2016 , after gifting his dad a car , the Fast and Furious star told the story of his father 's austere adolescence . Revealing that Rocky was kicked out of his mother 's house in 1954 at age 13 , he paid homage to his Amherst , Nova Scotia , Canada upbringing . `` My dad , Rocky Johnson , is a minimalist . Always has been , '' he wrote on Instagram at the time . `` Never asks me for much and , over the years , his needs are always the barest . ...

Also , makes me appreciate the fun times he would beat my ass in the gym so bad when I was 13 and say , ` If you 're gon na throw up , go outside . And if you 're gon na cry , then go home to your mother . ' I hated it then , but I embrace it now . Made a man outta me .

Among those have been some rather strange pairings , but this video from Road Test TV on YouTube shows us something we 've never seen before . No , it 's not the unlikely matchup between a Ford Mustang and a Range Rover Sport SVR . Rather , it 's the outcome of their first race that has our jaws dropped , and if you think you know what 's coming , think again . Save Thousands On A New Ford Mustang The SVR is the prizefighter in Land Rover 's lineup with its supercharged 5.0-liter V8 making 575 horsepower -LRB- 429 kilowatts -RRB- that goes to all four wheels . This particular Mustang wears the fascia of early S550 models from 2015 through 2017 , meaning its stock 5.0-liter V8 produces 435 hp -LRB- 324 kW -RRB- for the rear tires alone . On paper , it would seem the advantage goes to the SVR , but it 's also roughly 1,500 pounds heavier . Such mass certainly levels the playing field , and here 's where things get very interesting . The first pass down the strip proves this equality in dramatic fashion , as both vehicles run identical elapsed times and trap speeds -- 13.05 seconds at 109 mph . Technically speaking , the Mustang was ever-so-slightly faster with a speed of 109.48 versus 109.13 , and it was 3 thousandths quicker down the track . Still , that 's about as dead even a race as you 'll ever see at a drag strip . That 's tough to do with two identical vehicles , never mind two from completely different genres . But wait a second -- the Mustang finished well ahead of the Range Rover and had a huge starting line advantage . Timing systems at drag strips are independent for each lane , and the clock does n't start running until the car actually moves from the starting line . The Mustang left the line over a half-second quicker than the SVR -LRB- identified in the top right photo which shows each driver 's reaction time -RRB- , and though it does n't sound like much , that actually translates to more than a car length right off the bat . The Range Rover could 've sat at the light for several minutes before punching the gas , and the elapsed time would still be the same . The reaction time , however , would be catastrophically bad . That 's not the end of the story , however . These opponents face off for a second race , and this time the launch is nearly equal . Who wins the day ? We 'll leave that for the video , but based on the uncanny first run , you can bet it 's most decidedly one heck of a close race .", "url": "https://www.motor1.com/news/393116/mustang-range-rover-svr-drag-race/", "kws": ["SVR", "Ford^^Mustang", "Land^^Rover", "wheels", "Race", "drag^^strips", "Road^^Test^^TV", "models", "hp", "dramatic^^fashion", "video", "Timing^^systems", "videos", "YouTube", "Motor1.com", "things"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"TransportationVehicles": 0.999964714050293}, "second_cat": {"TransportationVehicles_Vehicles": 0.999964714050293}}}

He spent the 2019 season as a running backs assistant at Appalachian State under Eliah Drinkwitz . His work at Appalachian State was fortuitous , as the Mountaineers went 13-1 and outrushed opponents by over 100 yards per game . They finished the year with the nation 's No. 9 scoring offense , averaging over 38 points per game . Afterwards , Drinkwitz left to become head coach of Missouri , but Garrett was retained .

Netflix 's latest reality series released its first season finale on Wednesday . The Circle saw a rotating cast of strangers sequestered in individual apartments in a building in the U.K. and forced to become friends while only interacting with each other using a social media platform in a kind of online popularity contest . After 12 episodes , 26-year-old Sasso was named the winner of $ 100,000 ... to his obvious shock . `` I firmly had no idea it was happening , '' he tells PEOPLE . `` I 'm down to the final two and my hand is shaking , and my hand does not shake , '' he says , sounding exactly like he does on The Circle . `` I do not get nervous . '' He should n't have worried : The slick-haired New York bartender and self-proclaimed `` proudest mama 's boy you 're ever gon na meet '' pretty quickly charmed the rest of his castmates and -LRB- to take a very unscientific sampling -RRB- a lot of Netflix viewers as well . In a show about who ends up as the most popular , it definitely did n't hurt that he was never really hated by anyone else . Shubham Goel -- also known as `` Shooby '' and Sasso 's best Circle friend -- remembers `` the first day when I imploded and had a breakdown of a large magnitude , Joey was completely backing me up and supporting everything I said , '' he tells PEOPLE . `` Me and Joey were different in every single way , but we were best buds in there , '' says Goel , 24 . Proudly loyal , loudly -LRB- loudly -RRB- endearing and both childlike and competitive , Sasso , like Goel , largely cruised through the season as lesser-liked players got the cut . He had to make a few tough decisions himself , such as eliminating fellow contestant Sean Taylor soon after she revealed her real identity and allowing Miranda Bissonnette to get the boot even though they 'd opened up to one another and traded sexy emoji . `` I love these people , but it 's a game , which was so hard and difficult to do , '' Sasso acknowledges . `` I 've always been able to read people really well . I think that helped me tremendously . '' `` My thing has always been , just do n't judge me even though we 're supposed to be judging each other , '' he says , adding , `` My whole thing was at any point in the show , if I got blocked or go home , I just wanted to make sure I had no regrets and stayed true to myself . '' While he gushes -- really , he gushes -- about his fellow contestants and the time he spent with them , he admits he had to make some difficult choices . It was a game , after all . `` It 's hard for me to say what the best part was , because honestly every day was amazing and the games were great , the challenges were great , interactions were great , '' he says . `` However , the low point for me is so easy to remember , which was when I had to block Sean . '' `` Legitimately , '' he says , he `` struggled , cried and went to sleep just feeling absolutely terrible , '' after one of the season 's most emotional moments . Taylor had just opened up about catfishing the other players as a skinnier version of herself , then uploaded real photos of what she looked like -- and received a lot of love and support from her castmates . And then she got the boot . `` I got ta protect the OGs , '' Sasso explains , referring to the original group of players who all made it to the finale instead of people like Sean , who joined midseason . `` I 'm just a loyal dude , '' Sasso says . And he 's not one to forget a spark -- of friendship or romance . `` You really hold onto these people and you really start caring , '' he says . `` We definitely all stay in touch and touch base and it 's kind of a beautiful thing , '' he says . Multiple Circle players tell PEOPLE they 're planning to reunite soon in Miami , where Sammie Cimarelli lives . And Goel , Sasso says , is `` my boy , I love him ... I legitimately wanted him to win . '' `` Shooby , he 's just such an interesting person and his outlook on life and the way he looks at certain things and the modern world ... I think that 's what makes him a really , really beautiful person , '' Sasso says . Since the show started airing on Jan. 1 , Sasso has been getting a lot of questions about his relationship with Bissonnette since they shared a kiss after she was eliminated , and he vowed to take her on a date after all was said and done . They had a spark , so would they ever get together ? So far , they 're both just saying how great the other is , but that will likely change . Sasso noted on Instagram that he would `` finally dive into this and everything in our lives '' in the days following the finale 's release . What 's true , to hear the cast tell it , is how close they all got . `` Everyone 's like , ` Dude we 're a family , we did this , '`` Sasso says . `` It 's a shared experience that nobody can ever understand . We know that , and we try to hold that bond and keep it together . '' Part of that shared experience was being alone in his apartment -LRB- with only some company from the producers -RRB- . And that did make him go a little stir-crazy , `` but not in a bad way . '' `` The most surprising thing for me was how much gameplay there was , '' he says . `` Truly you wake up and it 's on , you 're rolling . '' On the finale , Sasso said he had just moved into a new apartment . He 's still bartending , he tells PEOPLE , and also going on acting auditions . He also co-wrote and starred in the independent film The Young Lion of the West , which took years and years to put together and , now that it 's done , he 's hoping to take on the festival circuit . Sasso describes it as a little Mean Streets , a little Saturday Night Fever ; he plays a club promoter in Rochester grappling with ambition , greed and family turmoil . But he could almost be talking about The Circle . `` It 's a magical thing that happened where all these amazing , amazing people got picked to do this thing , '' he says , `` and it also taught me that , yes , I 've been hurt and let down by friends in my life but I also never want that to make me feel jaded and change my trust in people .

That 's the first instruction from Mike Petersen , a retired soil scientist and agronomist . Petersen was a presenter at Wednesday 's South Platte River Salinity Workshop presented by the Centennial , Morgan and Sedgwick County Conservation Districts . Petersen manages the Orthman Research Farm near Lexington , Neb. , and consults with growers regarding strip-till system technology , fertilizer , crop development , root development , and water management . The agronomist addressed misconceptions about salinity in the South Platte Valley during Wednesday 's program . Chief among those misconceptions is that a good rainfall or snowmelt , along with cover crops and no-till practices will solve the problem . That ai n't so , Petersen said . `` It ai n't ever going to be like the good old days , '' he said . `` Change is mandatory . '' That 's a radical departure from the attitudes expressed in May 2019 when salinity in the South Platte first came to the public 's attention . In an article by Shay Castle of Fresh Water News the message was that it 's too soon to tell whether salinity is a problem in the South Platte . That 's when Colorado Corn announced it was sponsoring a study of the issue . That study was completed in October and is due to be released later this month . According to preliminary information in the report , the lower reaches of the river have become pretty salty . Phil Brink of Colorado Cattleman 's Ag Water Network led off with an overview of the issue , which he said has been followed in the Colorado River basin for several years . Brink said salinity levels below Hoover Dam are about 723 milligrams per liter , or about what is in the South Platte just below Denver . By the time the river gets to Sterling , however , that salinity has skyrocketed to 1,275 mg/l , almost twice as salty as the Denver reaches . While much of the problem stems from treated wastewater discharged by municipalities and industries upstream , agriculture is compounding the problem . The re-use of return flow water from upstream irrigation is concentrating salts from cropland and leaching it into the river , where it 's diverted or pumped onto crops and the cycle starts over . There are things that can be done to mitigate the damage , however . Petersen said no-till cultivation and leaving residue on the soil surface is the first step farmers need to take . Better water management , crop rotations and alternative crops are other methods producers can use to minimize salinity in the soil and , thus , in return flow to the river . `` That 's the good news , but it 's going to cost everyone something , '' Petersen said . `` And there 's just no option . Change is mandatory .

' I read with pleasure Quentin Young 's balanced and compassionate editorial on lifting the camping ban in Boulder . I am fully aware that if we do , the homeless will congregate along parts of the bike path , or in small parks in downtown Boulder , underpasses , etc. , and among them will be a few alcoholics and drug users . I am also aware that there will be some degree of littering . So we have a very painful choice to make : Do we retain the draconian , cruel and inhumane camping ban , to keep our city neat and tidy as we drive by in our shiny SUVs , or walk by a homeless man talking on our thousand-dollar cell phones , or do we choose the humane and compassionate path ? The majority of homeless are helpless and/or mentally ill and incapable of working . Jesus said he dwells in them : `` For I was hungry and you did not give me to eat ; I was naked and you did not clothe me ; I was sick and in prison and you did not come to see me -- believe me , when you refused these things to the least of your brethren , you refused them to me . '' Let us not scoff at the least of our brethren . Do not make them feel invisible . Stop and say hello . You will be amazed to find how decent , kind , intelligent and good most of them are . Ask yourself : `` What if I were homeless ? '' Remember : `` There , but for the Grace of God , go I. '' Sarah Heger Boulder Alexander Brown : Editorial appeared politically motivated I just read the Denver Post editorial in the Camera : `` Hick 's Budget Trick . '' I am an independent . A social liberal and a fiscal conservative . And it should be noted that I was actively supporting Alice Madden for Senate before she dropped out , and would have voted for her over John Hickenlooper in the primary . I want a semblance of unbiased news and opinion . I do n't mind opinion from either perspective if it is fair and honest . This editorial is neither . It suggests that former Gov. Hickenlooper was being unethical in his use of a source of federal funds as governor in 2012 when he spent $ 6 million of those funds in 2012 during the recession . It mentions in passing that former -LRB- Republican -RRB- Gov. Bill Owens spent $ 130 million of the same fund in two years , but did not look into what that was used for . It is worth noting that during Owens ' reign , the economy was booming , so if using the funds for the state was somehow unethical for Hickenlooper during the recession , what does that say about Owens ' use of more than 20 times the amount of the same funds ? Could the editorial concern possibly be because Hickenlooper is running against Sen. Cory Gardner for Senate and the polls show him with a dramatic lead ? Fair opinion is fine , but creating a false narrative is not . Six versus 130 ? That difference is dramatic . You are starting to look like a Giuliani/Putin conspiracy theorist . Cut it out , or you will lose me as a subscriber . Alexander Brown Boulder Pat Wright : Modernize Chautauqua 's bylaws These are the facts : Chautauqua is a treasure . There has been an ongoing issue regarding its bylaws , prior to my serving on the board , while serving on the board in the 1990s and presently . We need to modernize the bylaws , which have only been Band-Aided since their inception in 1901 . This is a treasure like no other in our country and it needs to be preserved . As a member of Chautauqua , I urge you to get out the vote and vote yes to save our cherished site . Pat Wright Boulder Carrie Kass : Nothing from Trump on disaster relief for a U.S. territory What about Puerto Rico ? Recently , a judge ruled that President Trump can use $ 175 million previously designated for military use to build his wall . The wall that he assured us four years ago would be fully funded by Mexico . The wall that he assured us we need to protect us from the hordes of terrorists supposedly coming across the U.S.-Mexico border . This week , details have been released describing the millions of dollars of damage suffered by Puerto Rico following not one but two large earthquakes . Puerto Rico , a U.S. territory . Yet I have not seen anything from Trump about disaster relief and assistance being provided to that country . Puerto Rico , a U.S. territory . Am I the only one who finds this state of affairs sadly discrepant ? I suspect not . Carrie Kass Longmont Dave Walden : Do n't turn Colorado into a bastion of socialism California has never lost a congressional seat . They are projected to do so following the 2020 census . Apparently , it is now better to be `` red '' than dead -- at least in those bastions of increasing socialism that destructively characterize blue-state political sensibilities . Increasing numbers of Americans are fleeing them . Message to blue-state strategists : Send us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to be free-er . Message to blue-state immigrants : When you arrive , please remember that whether you be Democrat , Republican , independent , or `` undocumented , '' you must help us assure that the same destructive policies from which you fled are not further instituted here .

We shall trust in your continued common sense to see that we are all in this fight to preserve our way of life , together .

The BBC discovered the issue and that prompted the tech firm to act . Our investigation found it possible to target users who had shown an interest in keywords including `` transphobic '' , `` white supremacists '' and `` anti-gay '' . Twitter allows ads to be directed at users who have posted about or searched for specific topics . But the firm has now said it is sorry for failing to exclude discriminatory terms . Anti-hate charities had raised concerns that the US tech company 's advertising platform could have been used to spread intolerance . What exactly was the problem ? Like many social media companies , Twitter creates detailed profiles of its users by collecting data on the things they post , like , watch and share . They can also control who sees their message by using keywords . Twitter gives the advertiser an estimate for how many users are likely to qualify as a result . For example , a car website wanting to reach people using the term `` petrolhead '' would be told that the potential audience is between 140,000 and 172,000 people . Twitter 's keywords were supposed to be restricted . But our tests showed that it was possible to advertise to people using the term `` neo-Nazi '' . The ad tool had indicated that in the UK , this would target a potential audience of 67,000 to 81,000 people . Other more offensive terms were also an option . How did the BBC test this ? We created a generic advert from an anonymous Twitter account , saying `` Happy New Year '' . We then targeted three different audiences based on sensitive keywords . Twitter 's website said that ads on its platform would be reviewed prior to being launched , and the BBC 's ad initially went into a `` pending '' state . But soon afterwards , it was approved and ran for a few hours until we stopped it . In that time , 37 users saw the post and two of them clicked on a link attached , which directed them to a news article about memes . Running the ad cost # 3.84 . Targeting an advert using other problematic keywords seemed to be just as easy to do . A campaign using the keywords `` islamophobes '' , `` islamaphobia '' , `` islamophobic '' and ' #islamophobic ' had a potential to reach 92,900 to 114,000 Twitter users , according to Twitter 's tool . We ran the same advert to an audience of 13 to 24-year-olds using the keywords `` anorexic '' , `` bulimic '' , `` anorexia '' and `` bulimia '' . Twitter estimated the target audience amounted to 20,000 people . The post was seen by 255 users , and 14 people clicked on the link before we stopped it . What did campaigners say ? Hope Not Hate , an anti-extremism charity , said it feared that Twitter 's ads could become a propaganda tool for the far-right . `` I can see this being used to promote engagement and deepen the conviction of individuals who have indicated some or partial agreement with intolerant causes or ideas , '' said Patrik Hermansson , its social media researcher . The eating disorder charity Anorexia and Bulimia Care added that it believed the ad tool had already been abused . `` I 've been talking about my eating disorder on social media for a few years now and been targeted many times with adverts based on dietary supplements , weight loss supplements , spinal corrective surgery , '' said Daniel Magson , the organisation 's chairman . `` It 's quite triggering for me , and I 'm campaigning to get it stopped through Parliament . So , it 's great news that Twitter has now acted . '' What did Twitter say ? The social network said it had policies in place to avoid the abuse of keyword targeting , but acknowledged they had not been applied correctly . '' -LSB- Our -RSB- preventative measures include banning certain sensitive or discriminatory terms , which we update on a continuous basis , '' it said in a statement . `` In this instance , some of these terms were permitted for targeting purposes . This was an error . `` We 're very sorry this happened and as soon as we were made aware of the issue , we rectified it . `` We continue to enforce our ads policies , including restricting the promotion of content in a wide range of areas , including inappropriate content targeting minors .

At issue was a Lightfoot-sponsored measure calling for the city to conduct a yearlong study into whether LGBTQ-run companies face discrimination when vying for city work . President Donald Trump picked a lead attorney to defend him in the impeachment trial and it 's none other than White House counsel Pat Cipollone , a University of Chicago Law School grad who made waves with Congress and some of his classmates last fall . The trial is expected to get underway next week , and Lightfoot -- who like most Democratic leaders is a regular critic of Trump -- will be in Washington , D.C. , where she 'll play a high-profile role in the U.S. Conference of Mayors ' winter meeting . Now that 's timing . During a ceremony to sign a new China trade deal today , President Donald Trump called out a list of top-tier business executives whom The New York Times describes as Wall Street executives who will benefit . But in the process he mentioned by name Illinois ' richest man -- Citadel hedge fund founder Ken Griffin , a self-described Ronald Reagan Republican who has given Trump mixed reviews .

Trump 's pick for top attorney in impeachment trial -- a U. of C. Law School grad who ticked off his onetime classmates last year The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives today voted to officially send articles of impeachment against President Trump to the U.S. Senate , triggering the start of a trial that 's expected to begin next week and could end -- though it 's unlikely -- with Trump getting the boot from office . The case centers on allegations that Trump withheld aid to Ukraine until officials in that country publicly announced they 'd investigate his political rival , former Vice President Joe Biden . Now we know that Trump has tapped University of Chicago Law School alum Pat Cipollone , the White House counsel who during the U.S. House impeachment inquiry hearings ignored House Democrats ' requests for White House witnesses and documents . Associated Press reporter Aamer Madhani explains : `` Cipollone ... forcefully defended Trump 's right to executive privilege and argued that congressional investigators have no right to question White House advisers about conversations with the president on withholding military aid from Ukraine '' as Democrats have alleged . While Cipollone 's fans lauded that approach , 21 classmates from his 1991 graduating class at the University of Chicago took issue with him blocking impeachment witnesses . As Madhani notes , they `` responded with an open letter accusing him of flouting the ` traditions of intellectual honesty or rigor ' taught at their alma mater . '' Read more about Cipollone here .

Max H. Rookstool , the 17-year-old student accused of engaging in human trafficking and child pornography , appeared in court by video from Hall County Jail . Rookstool is accused of 17 offenses , 16 of which are felonies . He is charged with two counts of human trafficking , two counts of human trafficking of a minor , one count of first-degree sexual assault , 11 counts of visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct and one count of unlawful distribution of images or videos of another person 's intimate area . The alleged crimes took place between Aug. 1 , 2018 , and Oct. 4 , 2019 . Corey enumerated the charges against Rookstool and asked if he understood them . One of the offenses , labor or sex trafficking of a minor , carries a sentence of 20 years to life . It is a Class 1B felony . At this point , Rookstool said , he plans to hire an attorney rather than have one appointed for him . Hall County Attorney Marty Klein said the state has very serious concerns about the safety of the public . Klein asked Corey to set a significant cash bond because of the seriousness of the alleged crimes and the number of people affected . In outlining probable cause , he said the defendant in essence used blackmail to commit the crimes . Corey set bond for Rookstool at $ 750,000 . To be released from jail , the defendant must pay 10 % of that amount . The judge also specified that he have no contact with the alleged victims and scheduled his preliminary hearing for 10 a.m. Feb. 20 . Later , Brian Mohr appeared in Corey 's courtroom . Until his arrest this week , Mohr was a teacher at Northwest High School . Mohr , 37 , is charged with 11 counts of possession of child pornography , each of which is a Class 2A felony . According to the complaint , those crimes all took place on July 1 , 2019 . Corey set Mohr 's bond at $ 400,000 . His preliminary hearing will be at 11:30 a.m. Feb. 12 . In Wednesday 's police media report , Grand Island police said Mohr was found to be in possession of 34 images of child pornography . `` The identities and ages of these victims have been verified , and are confirmed to be under the age of 19 years old . Brian admitted to investigators that he knew he was in possession of child pornography , '' the report says . The media report also states that the juvenile male -LRB- Rookstool -RRB- `` sent multiple nude images of children who have been identified , and confirmed to be under the age of 19 years old without their consent . The juvenile male used threat and or coercion to have a minor engage in sexually explicit performances and for the production of child pornography . The juvenile male also used these same unlawful means to have an adult engage in unwanted sexual activity and for the production of pornography . '' Police Capt. Jim Duering said the adult mentioned in the media report was a student who has become an adult . Duering does not believe that Mohr `` was involved in any of the trafficking or sexual assault activities . '' He said the people depicted in the photos did not consent to the sharing of the images . In this case , police believe Rookstool used a ruse to obtain the explicit photos , and then shared them without consent , Duering said . After Wednesday 's court appearance by Rookstool , Klein was asked if the victims are female or male . He declined to answer the question because he 's doing his best to avoid identifying the victims , he said . Klein said his argument for probable cause `` involved the defendant having coerced through threats of redistribution of people 's intimate photographs , '' in part by requesting that they have sex or commit sexual acts with him , in addition to distributing numerous photographs of minors ' sexually explicit conduct . Rookstool and Mohr were arrested by Grand Island police in conjunction with Homeland Security Investigations -LRB- HSI -RRB- . The case started with the Grand Island Police Department but HSI was pulled in because of the trafficking aspect , Duering said . The federal agency , which is part of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , `` came through with some great resources , '' he said .", "url": "https://www.theindependent.com/news/crimes/northwest-student-teacher-make-first-court-appearances/article_c4a53724-37f3-11ea-9e6d-43c5dbafc995.html", "kws": ["court", "Hall^^County^^Jail", "first-degree^^sexual^^assault", "County^^Jail", "sexual^^assault", "felonies", "child^^pornography", "minors", "Grand^^Island^^police", "commit^^sexual^^acts", "sex^^trafficking", "investigators", "Brian^^Mohr", "Max^^H.^^Rookstool", "unlawful^^distribution", "human^^trafficking", "Marty^^Klein", "unwanted^^sexual^^activity", "numerous^^photographs", "consent"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety": 1.0000097751617432}, "second_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety_Other": 1.0000097751617432}}}

The council 's decision to strip 512 of its business license followed a complaint for disciplinary action against owner RTB , Inc. and an hour-long public hearing Wednesday . The complaint issued by the city detailed incidents dating to July 2017 including reports by patrons that they were roughed up by club security . Metropolitan Police Department Sgt. Beth Schmidt , one of three officers who testified during the hearing , said that club security 's penchant for pursuing clubgoers outside the business boundaries was unacceptable . Officers showed surveillance video illustrating violent interactions between security and patrons including one guard knocking a man unconscious and no employees coming to the man 's aid as he laid motionless on the sidewalk . The most serious incident within the complaint described a shooting by suspects involved in a fight at the club , formerly known as Red , on Dec. 23 , 2017 . The suspects were kicked out of the club by security and returned , shooting at the guard of nearby pizza restaurant , Evel Pie . The guard was struck four times , according to the complaint . Attorney Clyde DeWitt , hired to represent the club , said Wednesday that ownership had fired bad-acting security guards . He also said he believed as recently as Tuesday that 512 would be sold , which he presumed would resolve the current trouble with the city . DeWitt also spoke about a `` dramatic change in the business '' that occurred in May , after the club was shut down for two weeks following two fights involving security within days . He said ownership added metal detectors and patron scanners , changed the club name and music format , and initiated a new concept for a split establishment with a separate club and restaurant . There had been no major issues at the club since those changes were implemented and the city has no present issues with the most recent security plan , according to DeWitt , as he sought to delay any council decision . There were 42 calls for police service at the club since May , with half self-initiated by officers , authorities said . Councilwoman Olivia Diaz , who represents the district where the club is located , was unconvinced . `` How many more victims are out there that have n't come before law enforcement to tell them that they 've been mistreated ? '' Diaz asked aloud . She said the city had been patient with 512 until now , but that it was time to act . The club was first licensed to operate by city officials in August 2016 .

He saw one of his friends run one way , shot in the foot . Then he saw his cousin , Juan Javier Cruz , turn to him with blood down the side of his face . Pausing to wipe away tears in court Wednesday afternoon , he said , through the help of a Spanish interpreter , he watched the 22-year-old fall to the ground that night . Seconds before , Pedro Cruz said the alleged gunman , Nelson Hernandez Mena , told the group of friends that in his country they killed gay men such as them like they were rats . Before his cousin , Juan , was fatally shot , he told Mena that 's not how it was in this country . The first-degree murder trial of Mena began Wednesday with opening statements and testimony from several witnesses before Circuit Judge Caroline Shepherd . Mena 's attorneys say the shooting was self-defense , but prosecutors and witnesses said the attack was deliberate . Mena is accused of killing Juan Cruz , who was in a group with several men including his cousin , Pedro Cruz , and Quevin Armando Jimenez Tepeque , outside of Restaurante y Pupuseria Las Flores near the intersection of Lake Avenue and Dixie Highway in 2017 . Tepeque , 25 , said they were all at the bar having a good time dancing , drinking and talking . He said he noticed one man watching him and he eventually got his phone number as they spoke closely over the loud music . That man was sitting in a group with Mena and several others . As they left the bar late that night , Tepeque said he heard one man say something along the lines of wanting to `` repeat the massacre in Orlando , '' referencing the mass shooting at the Pulse Nightclub in 2016 . He said he , the cousins and others continued in their way to their car but then were `` startled '' by the loud voice of Mena . `` He paralyzed all of us with his strong voice when he said in my country we kill the gays like rats , '' Tepeque said through a Spanish interpreter . He said the gun went off , striking him in the foot and he fled believing if he did n't he would be killed . He said as he ran , he bled and eventually lost strength but two men near a bus stop were able to help him . During opening statements , Assistant Public Defender Harris Printz told the jury of seven men and seven women , his client was outnumbered and he was defending himself when he fired his weapon . `` This is not a case about homosexuality . His own friend was gay , and you can see it with your own eyes in the videos , '' he said , referencing surveillance videos from the restaurant showing one of the men sitting with Mena that night had given his phone number to Tepeque . `` Despite the tragic results , this is a case of self-defense . '' Assistant State Attorney Danielle Kushel told the jury the videos will show Mena getting angry as the group of men including Tepeque and Cruz enjoying their night , but minding their own business . She said video shows him `` getting his firearm into a ready position before anyone in either party even gets up to leave . '' Printz argued in his to the jury Mena was merely fixing the gun that had slid out of his waistband because he did n't have it holstered . Kushel disagreed . `` The evidence will show Mena , who perhaps thought it was acceptable in his country , growing exasperated with disgust with these men and their homosexuality , knew exactly what he was going to do from inside Las Flores , '' she said . hwinston@pbpost.com @hannahwinston", "url": "https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20200115/trial-begins-in-2017-lake-worth-beach-fatal-shooting", "kws": ["shooting", "Lake^^Worth^^Beach", "Lake^^Avenue", "Lake", "WEST^^PALM^^BEACH", "testimony", "Dixie^^Highway", "court", "Las^^Flores", "Orlando", "Nelson^^Hernandez^^Mena", "Juan^^Javier^^Cruz", "Juan^^Cruz", "Pulse^^Nightclub", "fall", "Pedro^^Cruz", "Harris^^Printz", "surveillance^^videos", "gay^^men", "rats"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety": 1.0000098943710327}, "second_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety_Other": 1.0000098943710327}}}

Jenelle Butler , along with her husband Crezdon Butler , on Wednesday sued Stage 29 Productions claiming she suffered `` horrendous injuries '' because producers were negligent in choosing the doctor who performed her surgery . Butler says she had built a successful personal fitness business , including a trademarked clothing line and corporate partnerships , and a loyal following of thousands on social media , according to the complaint . In 2010 , she made `` a young , dumb decision '' to get butt implants and it was the `` sole regret '' she had about her body when she made the decision to have them removed to set a good example for her followers . She shared her desire to have corrective surgery publicly , and a Stage 29 producer contacted her about appearing on The Doctors . She flew to L.A. and was surprised on air by the announcement that Miami-based plastic surgeon Constantino Mendieta had offered to do the silicone-removal surgery for free . Butler says she told a Stage 29 producer that she 'd rather use a doctor with whom she 'd previously had a consultation . `` She was uneasy about using a surgeon she had never heard of , and whose website did not show any `` before/after '' photographs of his gluteal-silicone-removal procedures , '' writes attorney Christopher Ridout in the complaint . `` The Stage 29 producer responded that the procedure would only be free of charge if Jenelle Butler went with Dr. Mendieta . In reliance on the reputation of ` The Doctors , ' Jenelle Butler reluctantly agreed to place herself in the care of a surgeon whom she had never met in-person . '' In January 2018 , Mendieta performed the surgery and it was filmed by a local crew , but Butler says she 's never seen the footage . The doctor she had originally wanted to perform the surgery , Alberto Gallerani , has testified that Mendieta made several critical errors including failing to view MRI films before the surgery , failing to determine where to make incisions prior to the surgery and cutting too many of Butler 's blood vessels . As a result , Butler `` experienced tremendous tissue necrosis -LRB- death -RRB- in her gluteal region '' and she lost excessive amounts of blood . `` If Dr. Mendieta had performed the surgery over the course of several sessions , with an appropriately conservative approach to the incisions , Jenelle Butler would not have had to receive blood transfusions , suffered the extensive tissue-death , experienced the agony of dealing with those deep and open wounds for months , or been left with such horrendous scarring and disfigurement , '' writes Ridout , adding that her inability to function after the surgery made her `` depressed to the point that she even contemplated suicide . '' Butler says Stage 29 knew , or should have known , about a series of malpractice complaints against Mendieta including a gluteal-implant-removal surgery that resulted in infection , amputation and ultimately the patient 's death ; a patient who sued him for leaving part of a medical instrument inside her breast and another who alleged he inserted a facial implant without their permission . She 's suing for negligent selection , negligent breach of voluntary undertaking and loss of consortium .

You 've most likely heard about it , but may not know the details . The keto diet , also known as the ketogenic diet , is a low-carb , often high-fat diet meant to kickstart weight loss . It 's very trendy right now , but that does n't mean it 's a quick and easy fix . Anyone on a keto diet will have a diet that is mostly fat , with small amounts of protein , and little to no carbs .

But let me give it a try . The harshness of the Astros ' sentence , when compounded with the vigorous response by the team 's owner , is only starting to sink into the public consciousness . Forget the $ 5 million fine and the forfeited draft picks . The scandal has taken down the two chief architects of one of baseball 's most successful teams , and also cut down the manager of the Boston Red Sox , the alleged instigator of the cheating scheme . But some observers ca n't understand why MLB came down so hard on the Astros . All they did was steal the other team 's signs , something baseball players have been trying to do for over a century . Sign stealing is n't only accepted -- it is celebrated . The only accomplishment of my undistinguished high school playing career is that , thanks to a sloppy catcher and a system that did n't require an Enigma machine to crack , in a key series , I decoded the other team 's signs and tipped off our batters to what was coming . How was what the Astros did any different than what I did ? All they did , the critics argue , is invest more resources and exercise unusual ingenuity in the sign-stealing enterprise . In principle , sign stealing is sign stealing -- it is irrational and unfair to treat the Astros so harshly . Here 's where Scruton can help us . One of the persistent themes of his numerous learned works was making the argument that a healthy politics can not be founded on adherence to abstract theory . Any attempt to force human beings to conform to an ideological paradigm will only lead to destructive conflict and policy failure . What a decent politics can accomplish is to preserve a particular community 's way of life . The key , Scruton explained , to saving what is truly dear to us is the preservation of tradition -- holding on to cherished institutions and practices , even if they appear incoherent or out of step with progressive opinion . Our way of life is most threatened by the committed rationalist , who , often claiming the authority of science , wants to transform society in accordance with the reformer 's vision of abstract justice . The ideologue looks at the question of sign stealing and says you have to make a decision -- either it 's cheating or not . The wise person relies more on tradition than ruthless logic . Classic sign stealing , carried out by a sharp-eyed runner using the naked eye , is more than legal -- it is part of what we love about the sport . Employing surveillance technology and a team of analysts to gather intelligence is a perversion of the game . MLB got this one right . As important as baseball may be , the conservative persuasion has more important work to do . It counsels pro-life activists , for example , that it is reasonable to require physicians to offer an ultrasound to pregnant women considering abortion , but forcing them to perform one violates our traditions . Conversely , pro-choice activists go awry when they oppose laws forbidding the killing of a child that has survived an attempted abortion . Some may not see the rationality of this law , but our moral sense is a far better guide to action than logic . Andrew Spiropoulos is the Robert S. Kerr , Sr. .

Good choices ; you probably needed them . But you also probably need some financial resolutions for 2020 , and your list should include these : 1 -RRB- Reduce your debt . This is probably the easiest fiscal resolution you can make , and the most important one . It 's actually not that hard . You simply spend less than you take in . Unless you 're , say , a single parent supporting a large family on a lean income , you can probably do it . Most of us spend money on things we really do n't need , from Starbucks to eating out . If your closet and drawers have enough clothes in them -- and they probably do , including things you do n't wear -- do n't buy any more stuff . If you have debt , and most of us do , you must try to pay it down as quickly as possible . That process can be helped by the advice in the preceding sentences , the ones about not buying things you do n't need . The only way to get out of debt is to pay it down . Start this year , and try to be debt-free by 2021 . Then stay that way . 2 -RRB- Review your car insurance . If you have the Texas minimums on your auto insurance , they 're not enough . They provide only $ 30,000 per injured person and $ 25,000 for property damage , with other paltry limits in other categories . That 's not enough today . Doctor or hospital bills for someone you injure can easily exceed 30 grand . Average-priced cars cost more than $ 25K . If you cause expenses beyond these limits , you could be sued . Increase your coverage for basically pennies on the dollar . It 's very cost-effective . 3 -RRB- Review your life insurance . Some people seem to think they 'll live forever or that their dependents will magically get by if they do somehow pass away . Get real . If you have a spouse or children who depend on your income , you must have life insurance to take care of them when you 're gone . If you 're young , life insurance is usually quite affordable . Even if you 're older , your heirs ca n't afford to be without it . Get at least $ 100,000 , but if you think that 's a lot of money , it is n't . Your dependents could go through that in a few years -LRB- or less -RRB- even if they 're frugal . Try for at least $ 200,000 , but again , that number is not as large as it seems . One key goal is to leave enough money to pay off the house for your dependents and still leave them some money to work with . 4 -RRB- Develop a budget . If you just spend your money without a plan , you 're probably spending too much . You do n't realize how much your frittering away on fast food or drinks after work . Those `` small '' expenditures add up . They can be the difference between you saving some money -LRB- next item -RRB- or limping along from paycheck to paycheck . Debt guru Dave Ramsey recommends the EveryDollar budgeting app , which can be downloaded for free , and there are other free budget plans online . Download one and make sure you are spending your money where you need to be spending it . 5 -RRB- Again , most of us fail this basic standard . Start with developing an emergency fund of at least a thousand dollars , and preferably more . This is not a bank account you dip into . It is only for emergencies , which will happen . When they do , you pay for them from this fund -- and then replenish it . That way , you do n't have to increase your debt . -LRB- See the first item on this list . -RRB- Then , build for the long haul , your retirement . If your company has a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- match , max out on that . They 're giving you free money . It is one of the best ways to build wealth . Once you set aside some money for a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- or another savings plan , you can adjust to it and just get used to working with the money you have left . If you save prudently during your working years , you can retire when you want , and with dignity . That 's huge , and you can make it happen with discipline . 6 -RRB- Get a better job . Please disregard this item if you have one you like . Congrats . But some of us are stuck in jobs or careers we do n't like . Now is the time to make your move . The national unemployment rate is only 3.5 % , the lowest in decades , and far below the rate we will usually see . Take advantage of this now by striking out , even if you have to move to another state . This is not easy , as most of us are leery of change . But going to the same dead-end job every day will drain the joy from your life . Suck it up , take the plunge , and you will be better for it . Top 10 causes of debt 1 -RRB- Less income with same expenses 2 -RRB- Divorce 3 -RRB- Poor money management skills 4 -RRB- Medical expenses 5 -RRB- Gambling and addictions 6 -RRB- Underemployment/not earning enough 7 -RRB- Spending before you get paid 8 -RRB- Not saving enough 9 -RRB- Inflation 10 -RRB- Lack of financial literacy Source : Credit Law Center ... There may be other things you need to do to get your financial house in order , but these are the basics . They are not complicated ; in fact , they are quite simple . They are based on the old saying , `` If your outgo exceeds your income , your upkeep will be your downfall .

Blair says his relationship with them hit the rocks when he came out as gay at the age of 14 but it `` completely broke down '' when he was at university . The 21-year-old says the stress of trying to support himself led to him dropping out of his course last year . There are now calls for estranged students to be entitled to the same support as those who have experienced the care system . Blair , from Kilsyth in North Lanarkshire , told BBC Scotland 's The Nine : `` I 'm from a religious family and when I came out as gay I was told that was n't an option . `` I was told that my parents would not have a gay son so I would either be straight or not be their son . '' He says he `` remained closeted '' for the next four years while he was in school . `` I had to live a horrible double life , '' he says . When he went to study law at Glasgow University he wanted to sever all ties with his family but discovered their income was taken into account when assessing his student loan , leaving him with about # 3,000 less than an independent student . He says : `` It is very difficult because the whole system is based on the assumption that your parents will help out . '' Blair says he was working in two part-time jobs but could not make ends meet . `` I was in rent arrears , I was stealing food from work , I could not afford to live really and the stress of all that combined with all of the stress of being at university meant I had to drop out in January 2019 . '' Blair was entitled to extra funding from SAAS - the Scottish Government agency which provides students with financial support but he says he found it difficult to prove he was estranged . He says the online form would not let him claim `` estrangement '' status and he had to phone up SAAS , who he says were `` completely insensitive '' . After he had dropped out , SAAS eventually recognised Blair as being estranged and he got extra funding to resume his studies . What is estrangement ? Students who are under 25 can apply for `` estrangement '' status if there is a permanent breakdown in their relationship with their parents or guardian . This means they will be exempt from their parents ' income being taken into account when working out how much funding , such as student loans , they are allowed . SAAS says all cases are assessed individually but it would expect there to have been no contact for at least 12 months . The `` estrangement '' needs to be `` endorsed by a professional person who knows your circumstances '' such as social worker , college/university adviser or a teacher . People over 25 are classed as `` independent '' students . ` Corporate parent ' Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin , who was a college lecturer for 13 years , says her own experience tells her that many people are `` falling through the cracks '' . `` I reflect back on my experience as a lecturer and students would drop out and you would never know why , '' she says . `` I wonder how many of my students were in that situation where they did not have that support . '' The SNP MSP is backing a campaign by the charity Stand Alone that calls on the Scottish government to give estranged students the same rights as young people who have been in care . This would mean more access to funding and support . ` Cliff-edge moments ' Ms Martin says estranged students need a bursary to give them an opportunity to have accommodation that is not just term-time . `` They are not able to go home during the recess period and they are not able to go back to mum and dad when they graduate . These can be real cliff edge moments for estranged students , '' she says . Ms Martin also says there is an issue with who will be the `` guarantor '' for tenancies on flats rented by estranged students . She wants the same `` corporate parent '' arrangements as for care-experienced students which mean the university acts as the guarantor . The Scottish government said they were committed to supporting estranged students and were `` actively considering '' the call to extend the care-experienced bursary to estranged students . They said SAAS were also making `` enhancements '' to the online application process that Blair found so difficult to navigate . Blair says : `` If there was treatment on a par with care-experienced students then more estranged students could go to university and graduate and have successful and healthier lives .

It revolved around an aborted handshake , charges of sexism and a dispute over who said what at a dinner in 2018 between the two New England senators now fighting to be the field 's progressive standard-bearer , Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders . Ms. Warren contends that , during a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate in late 2018 , Mr. Sanders told her he did not believe that a woman could win the presidency . Mr. Sanders has dismissed the charge as `` ludicrous '' and initially accused some on the Warren campaign staff of lying about it . When asked about the comment by the debate moderators , Mr. Sanders doubled down on his denial . `` Anybody knows me knows that it 's incomprehensible that I would think that a woman can not be president of the United States . '' Now , one could point out that believing a woman can be president of the United States is not the same as questioning whether a woman can get elected president . Ms. Warren did not waste time on such semantic quibbles nor on a round of he said-she said . She went right at the underlying issue . `` Bernie is my friend , and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie , '' she said . `` But look , this question about whether or not a woman can be president has been raised and it 's time for us to attack it head-on . '' From there , she went on to note that the collective win-loss record of the women on the stage -- she and Senator Amy Klobuchar -- topped that of the men -LRB- Mr. Sanders , former Mayor Pete Buttigieg , former Vice President Joe Biden and the businessman Tom Steyer -RRB- . At debate 's end , as the candidates were indulging in phony chitchat for the cameras , Ms. Warren ignored -- maybe even rejected ! -- Mr. Sanders 's proffered handshake , and the two had what looked like a tense exchange . Social media promptly went berserk , and the brewing feud became the story of the evening . But this is not about Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren . Not really . And Ms. Warren was right to try to shift the focus to the bigger picture -- even if some critics will sneer that she 's playing `` the gender card . '' Sure , this controversy has resurfaced some of Mr. Sanders 's past women troubles . His 2016 campaign faced multiple accusations of sexual harassment , pay inequities and other gender-based mistreatment . Asked early last year if he knew about the complaints , Mr. Sanders 's reaction was both defensive and dismissive : `` I was a little bit busy running around the country . '' It also does n't help that the Bernie Bros , a segment of Mr. Sanders 's most animated supporters , are famous for their aggressive , at times abusive behavior toward his opponents and critics , earning a reputation for toxic machismo . That said , the reason Mr. Sanders 's alleged remark has resonated so loudly is not that it revealed him to be an out-of-touch , beyond-the-pale sexist , but that it gave voice to the same fear that many , many Democrats have been expressing sotto voce . What if America really is n't ready to elect a woman president ? To some , this sounds like an absurd concern . As Mr. Sanders himself has taken to pointing out , Hillary Clinton won three million more votes in 2016 than did Donald Trump . But she did n't win the right votes , many Democrats whisper back . She did not win the presidency , despite facing the most patently unfit opponent in the history of the Republic . Obviously , women candidates are not monolithic and , as such , their electability can not be evaluated so grossly . Elizabeth Warren is not Hillary Clinton . She lacks some of Mrs. Clinton 's strengths and experience , but also much of her baggage . And yet . ... It can be hard to shake the tickle in the back of your brain that Mr. Trump 's retrograde brand of politics -- his naked appeals to sexism , racism and other forms of old-school bigotry -- can be weaponized all too easily against a woman opponent , who , fairly or not , already faces generic , gender-based hurdles . Countless hours have been devoted to examining the often unconscious gender bias that female candidates still contend with . Among other troubling disparities : Women who deviate from traditional gender roles face a risk of backlash from men -LRB- and women -RRB- who value those roles ; women in positions of power tend to be considered less legitimate than their male counterparts ; and ambitious women are viewed more negatively , by men and women alike , than ambitious men . Such biases can provoke a visceral response , noted Peter Beinart , a professor of journalism and political science at the City University of New York , in a 2016 piece for The Atlantic . Among other studies , he cited a 2010 paper by two Yale researchers who found that `` people 's views of a fictional male state senator did not change when they were told he was ambitious . When told that a fictional female state senator was ambitious , however , men and women alike ` experienced feelings of moral outrage , ' such as contempt , anger , and disgust . '' Contempt . Anger . Disgust . That 's hardly the basis for a level playing field . Polling does n't much clarify the matter . While most Americans claim they are ready for a woman president , far fewer see other people as quite so open to the possibility . A September poll by Lean In , a women 's advocacy group , found that while 53 percent of voters considered themselves `` extremely '' or `` very ready '' for a woman president , only 16 percent thought most Americans felt the same . A poll conducted in June by Ipsos for The Daily Beast found that 74 percent of independents and Democrats said they were personally comfortable with a woman president , but only 33 percent thought the same of their neighbors . -LRB- A full 20 percent of Independent and Democratic men agreed that `` women are less effective in politics than men . '' -RRB- An August survey by Ipsos and USA Today found that only 44 percent of likely Democratic primary voters thought their neighbors would be comfortable with a woman president . This goes beyond the time-honored dodge of : I 'm not sexist/racist/homophobic , but I 'm not so sure about my neighbors . `` If voters do n't think that America is ready , they tend to be less likely to vote for a woman themselves , '' the chief executive of Lean In , Rachel Thomas , told ABC News . In a race such as this one , in which electability looms as a central requirement , perceptions of other people 's biases matter all the more . This less-than-inspiring data -- along with from-the-trail anecdotes about the gender-based voter anxiety that Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar have been facing -- help explain why Mr. Sanders 's alleged remarks struck such a nerve . Women candidates and their supporters are n't simply outraged that he could be so wrong . They 're worried that he might be right .

From May , its store in Middleton , Leeds , will become the first Asda in the UK where shoppers can fill up their own containers with a range of products , from big brands to own-label coffee and pasta . Shoppers will be able to use refill points stocked with Kellogg 's cereals such as Rice Krispies and Unilever 's PG Tips tea . In addition to refill stations , the store will house a `` naked florist 's shop '' offering plastic-free flowers and loose produce with items such as cucumbers removed from their plastic packaging . A range of recycling facilities will include a reverse vending machine for plastic bottles and cans and clothes hanger recycling . The new-style store will be a `` live '' trial , monitored from its nearby head office . Customers will be asked to give feedback in different formats . Trials will last for at least three months before a decision is made whether to roll out , retrial or stop . Plastic waste has become a major environmental issue , with television programmes such as BBC One 's Blue Planet exposing its effects on the oceans , and media coverage highlighting the dangers of a global plastic binge . Roger Burnley , Asda 's chief executive , said : `` This is a journey we ca n't go alone , which is why we invited our suppliers to innovate with us . I 'm delighted that household names like Kellogg 's and Unilever have joined us in testing new ideas and approaches to sustainability . '' The `` unpackaged '' model relying on refills has to date been used predominantly by independent retailers , delicatessens and farm shops but is increasingly being tested by supermarkets in a quest to reduce single-use plastics . In June last year , Waitrose launched a trial at its Botley Road store in Oxford , offering refillable options for products including wine and beer -LRB- including Toast Ale -RRB- , rice and cleaning materials , as well as packaging-free loose fruit and veg and a frozen `` pick and mix '' section . The `` unpacked '' refillable zones have since been added to its stores in Cheltenham , Wallingford and Abingdon . In September , Sainsbury 's said selling milk and fizzy drinks in returnable glass bottles was an option , while Tesco is banning brands that use excessive packaging from its stores . Daniel Webb , of the campaign group Everyday Plastic , said : `` Offering less packaging through refill initiatives at major supermarkets presents a massive step towards reducing the amount of plastic being thrown away .

Los Angeles City Councilmen Paul Koretz and Gilbert Cedillo introduced a resolution on Wednesday , Jan. 15 , asking Major League Baseball to award the 2017 and 2018 World Series titles to the Dodgers . The league concluded this week that the Houston Astros used a camera to illicitly steal signs from opposing catchers during the 2017 season , which ended with the Astros defeating the Dodgers in the World Series . According to the league , the sign-stealing system was orchestrated by then-Astros bench coach Alex Cora , who served as manager of the Boston Red Sox in 2018 , which ended with the Red Sox defeating the Dodgers in the World Series . The league initially suspended Astros ' general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager A.J. Hinch for a year , but the club quickly fired the pair . The Astros were also fined $ 5 million and ordered to forfeit its first - and second-round draft picks for two years . Cora , who has yet to be punished by MLB , parted ways with the Red Sox this week following the release of the league investigation . Koretz conceded that it 's `` uncharted territory '' to request the league to strip two teams of their titles and award them to another , but he said it would be fair to give the Los Angeles players a championship after being cheated . `` MLB did take it seriously by -LRB- issuing -RRB- significant suspensions , which were followed by major league clubs firing managers , '' Koretz told City News Service . `` There have been scandals in the past over the century-plus that we 've had Major League Baseball in this country .

'' Koretz , a lifelong Dodger fan , said even the players who knew of the scheme to steal pitch signs but did not come forward about it should be held accountable . He said the cheating likely robbed longtime Dodgers players of a shot at the title , but he conceded there 's no way to know . According to Forbes Magazine , it 's highly unlikely that the teams will have to forfeit their World Series titles , as MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred is `` exceptionally limited in making it happen without going to war with the MLBPA , '' the union that represents the league 's players .

As a sophomore star for the Gibson City-Melvin-Sibley/Fisher co-op wrestling team last season , Horsch was determined to set things right when he broke his hand during practice on Jan. 2 , 2019 to cut short a promising 15-2 campaign . `` It was really disappointing , '' he remembers . `` I definitely did not like having to sit out from practice all the time ; sitting out from meets ; not being able to compete . '' Horsch went to the state tournament , where watching proved especially difficult . `` Coming off his freshman year , he had very high expectations , '' said Coach Josh Carter . `` He was wrestling pretty well . When something like that -LRB- injury -RRB- happens , it 's heartbreaking , but he definitely did n't sulk or whine about it . He continued to come to practice . He tried to make the best of a bad situation . '' Horsch has bounced back this season to build a 21-1 record at 126 pounds , which has moved his career record to 77-7 . Horsch , who went 41-4 as a freshman , remembers the injury like it happened yesterday . `` We were live wrestling and I just went to down block to defend a shot and I landed on my -LRB- right -RRB- hand in an awkward position and ended up breaking my metacarpal , '' he said . Experience has led to much of Horsch 's success , but he also credits fitness for giving him a confidence boost . `` I feel like working hard gives you an edge on your opponents because you know you put more work in than them , '' he said . `` You deserve to win . '' Horsch , among his team 's captains , does most of his training with 132-pounder Cole Maxey , who is a solid technician in the top position . `` He helps me a lot to work on bottom , '' Horsch said . `` He is such a good offensive person on top . He can get the wrist tied up very easily . `` We 're close to the same skill -LRB- level -RRB- on our feet . I always have to set up shots to get in . I ca n't just take whatever shot . It helps me perfect what I need to do on my feet . '' Carter says Horsch shines because of his athleticism , coachability and work ethic . Horsch spends the offseason competing on the freestyle and Greco Roman wrestling circuits . `` He 'll do whatever we ask him to do , '' Carter said . `` He 'll work his butt off in the practice room and outside of the practice room as well , just trying to prepare himself . When he steps on the mat , he 's got a good mentality . He does n't get so nervous that he ca n't function on the mat . '' Horsch 's lone loss this season came in the Plano Invitational semifinals against Elmhurst Immaculate Conception 's Nicholas Renteria , 10-6 . `` I found out what I really needed to work on my feet was hand fighting , '' Horsch said . `` I needed to work on that and being able to set up shots better ... clearing the hips . I was OK with the loss because it was time for me to learn and get better . '' ' Asked about his goal for the season , Horsch did n't hesitate . `` To win state , obviously , '' he said . Horsch also excels in football at Fisher where he earned second team all-Heart of Illinois Conference honors as a defensive back . As a receiver , he caught 23 passes for 270 yards and four touchdowns . Horsch says football and wrestling require similar mindsets . `` They both put your body on the line , '' he said . `` In football , the lifting helped with wrestling . The hard competition in wrestling makes you a better football player . You 're more aggressive . There are huge benefits from playing both sports . '' The 5-foot-5 Horsch , who weighed 135 during football , feels comfortable wrestling at 126 . `` Working hard at practice , I lose the weight pretty easily , '' he said . `` I can usually eat whatever I want . '' Horsch is part of an athletic family . His father , Grant , did football , basketball and wrestling -LRB- one season -RRB- at Fisher while his mother , the former Amy Stalter , participated in volleyball , basketball and track . His older brothers , Isaac and Jacob , both wrestled for GCMS-Fisher . Jacob is a sophomore member of the Heidelberg University wrestling team . `` My Dad , I credit him for my success , '' Horsch says . `` He always made me go to training sessions and certain camps . I never wanted to go . I wanted to be at home to play with my brothers . In the end , it 's made me better . I ca n't thank him enough for making me go to those things . '' Horsch plans to wrestle in college and study either athletic training or something related to veterinary science . As Horsch heads toward his destiny , he can take comfort in knowing he has the resolve to overcome bad breaks . Contact Randy Sharer at -LRB-309-RRB-\u00a0820-3405 .

Today , Google announced that the last supported platform , Chrome OS , is losing access to Chrome apps , too , along with dates to strip the app feature out of Chrome 's code base . Google writes it `` will begin phasing out support for Chrome Apps across all operating systems as follows : '' March 2020 : Chrome Web Store will stop accepting new Chrome Apps . Developers will be able to update existing Chrome Apps through June 2022 . June 2020 : End support for Chrome Apps on Windows , Mac , and Linux .

June 2022 : End support for Chrome Apps on Chrome OS for all customers . Most Windows , Mac , and Linux users have n't been able to use Chrome packaged apps for years now , as the Web store was shut down for them in 2017 . Users on those OSes should n't notice a thing , unless they were sideloading packaged apps or getting them through an enterprise management feature . Chrome OS is the real news here , and it will continue to cling to the feature until June 2022 . Chrome OS supports a number of platforms that get presented in the `` app '' style , so keep in mind only the `` Chrome Packaged Apps '' are going away . Chrome OS will still keep its app-like shortcuts to websites , along with support for `` Progressive Web Apps -LRB- PWA -RRB- '' -- Web APIs that support app-style features like push notifications and offline functionality . There 's still going to be support for Android apps , which bring the nearly 3 million apps in the Play Store to Chrome OS .

Koretz conceded that it 's `` uncharted territory '' to request the league to strip two teams of their titles and award them to another , but he said it would be fair to give the Los Angeles players a championship after being cheated . `` MLB did take it seriously by -LRB- issuing -RRB- significant suspensions , which were followed by major league clubs firing managers , '' Koretz told City News Service . `` There have been scandals in the past over the century-plus that we 've had Major League Baseball in this country . I 'm not sure if we 've had this documented an effort to steal two World Series , and we know the results . ... I think that would be an appropriate payback . I think this really besmirches the national pastime and the most historic sport in American history , and there has to be a message that this is n't allowed . '' Koretz , a lifelong Dodger fan , said even the players who knew of the scheme to steal pitch signs but did not come forward about it should be held accountable . He said the cheating likely robbed longtime Dodgers players of a shot at the title , but he conceded there 's no way to know . According to Forbes Magazine , it 's highly unlikely that the teams will have to forfeit their World Series titles , as MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred is `` exceptionally limited in making it happen without going to war with the MLBPA , '' the union that represents the league 's players . The resolution does not call for the city to initiate any legal action , although some Dodger fans have suggested going to court over the matter . The last time the Dodgers won the World Series was in 1988 , when they defeated the Oakland Athletics .", "url": "https://www.dailynews.com/2020/01/15/la-city-councilmen-to-mlb-give-our-dodgers-two-championships-please/", "kws": ["Dodgers", "longtime^^Dodgers^^players", "MLB", "Major^^League^^Baseball", "Houston^^Astros", "Red^^Sox", "Oakland^^Athletics", "The^^league", "Los^^Angeles", "manager^^A.J.^^Hinch", "Major^^League", "draft^^picks", "LA", "bench^^coach", "A.J.^^Hinch", "catchers", "Jeff^^Luhnow", "this^^week", "Boston", "MLBPA"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Baseball": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Baseball_MLB": 1.0}}}

As if there ever is . Routinely doing her job , politics reporter Allison Donahue , who writes for the Michigan Advance , walked up to state Sen. Peter Lucido to ask a question . What she got in response was one of `` those '' remarks . After the Senate session ended , the 22-year-old reporter approached the Republican to ask about his involvement in a since-deleted right-wing Facebook page that had posted misogynistic , even violent comments about Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer . He told her he could talk to her after he had finished honoring 30 students from the all-boys ' Catholic high school De La Salle Collegiate , his alma mater . They were waiting nearby , in earshot . As she walked away , he asked her if she knew the school , and she said no . `` It 's an all boys ' school , '' he then said , according to Donahue 's account in the Michigan Advance , a nonprofit news site covering politics and policy . `` You should hang around ! You could have a lot of fun with these boys , or they could have a lot of fun with you . '' The boys , perhaps self-consciously , burst out laughing , `` and I walked away knowing that I had been the punchline of their ` locker room ' talk , '' she wrote . `` Except it was n't the locker room ; it was the Senate chamber . And this is n't high school . It 's my career .

'' She pointed out that she was at work -LRB- rather than a dance -RRB- , and that he would not have made such a remark to a male or older colleague . `` It was n't the comment that necessarily knocked me off my feet , it was the fact that he knew he could get away with saying it , '' Donahue tweeted later . `` That 's not happening anymore .

Lucido chairs three committees and serves as majority whip , according to the Associated Press . `` Sexual harassment has no place in the Michigan Senate , '' Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey -LRB- R-Clarklake -RRB- and Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich -LRB- D-Flint -RRB- said in a letter to the legislature 's business office obtained by the Free Press . `` We take these allegations very seriously and trust that you will take appropriate action to resolve this matter . '' Lucido first told the Free Press that the remark had been all in fun , that they were being taken out of context , and that he did not owe an apology . But Wednesday he did an about-face and issued a brief one on Facebook , stating simply , `` I apologize for the misunderstanding yesterday and for offending Allison Donahue . '' I apologize for the misunderstanding yesterday and for offending Allison Donahue . Posted by Senator Peter J. Lucido on Wednesday , January 15 , 2020 Perhaps he 'd hoped to deflect attention from the actual story that Donahue had been reporting , which was to follow-up on a piece in the Detroit Metro Times profiling the Facebook group . It had started as a page opposed to Whitmer 's policies and `` devolved into a vile platform that promoted violence against Democrats and Muslims and churned out degrading comments about women , '' Detroit Metro Times reported last Friday . Before it disappeared after the newspaper 's report , the group had burgeoned to nearly 9,000 members that included `` elected officials , veterans , firefighters , law enforcement officers , educators , pastors , business owners , political candidates , militia members , blue-collar workers , and your garden variety trolls , '' the Metro Times said . Dozens of the posts threatened violence against Whitmer and other U.S. politicians including Rep. Rashida Tlaib , a Muslim American from Detroit . Lucido had shared more than a half dozen posts in the group since Nov. 29 , the newspaper said . He told Donahue his involvement was limited to posting videos addressing issues involved in Whitmer 's vetoes . -LSB- More U.S. News -RSB- ` Captain America ' actress charged with fatally stabbing mom told cops it was self-defense '' `` That 's their crap , not mine , '' he said of the violent , racist and inflammatory comment . `` If those people are talking cowardly and inciting violence , then they should be dealt with accordingly .

Gay and bisexual men have experienced the most dramatic decline in new infections , with rates falling by 73 % . It has been attributed to a rise in the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis -LRB- Prep -RRB- . Campaigners are urging the government to make Prep , which is almost 100 % effective at preventing transmission , more widely available . Virally suppressed Of the estimated 103,800 people living with HIV in the UK in 2018 , 93 % have been diagnosed with the virus . Of these , 97 % are receiving treatment . And of these , 97 % are , as a result , undetectable , meaning they can not transmit the virus . Among gay and bisexual men , transmissions of HIV have dropped from 2,300 in 2014 to 800 in 2018 . HIV testing has greatly increased over the past decade . And the number of men who have sex with men living undiagnosed with HIV has halved between 2014 and 2018 , to 3,600 . Impact trial Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK was on track to achieve its goal of ending HIV transmission by 2030 . `` I feel very strongly that we must end HIV transmission , '' he said . `` HIV has brought untold hurt and suffering to so many , so it is encouraging to see transmissions continue to fall across the UK . '' Prep is currently freely available for high-risk patients in Scotland but many in England have had to wait until they can gain access to an impact trial that first began in September 2017 . And as of October 2019 , at least 15 people in England have tested HIV positive while waiting for a place on the trial . What is Prep ? A pill taken daily or on demand prior to having sex , to prevent HIV infection If taken consistently , when a condom is not worn and someone comes into contact with HIV , it protects cells in the body and disables the virus to stop it multiplying A UK Medical Research Council-run study found an 86 % fall in new HIV infections among gay men on Prep compared with non-users Many in the sexual-health sector say Prep , when taken correctly , is almost 100 % effective It is aimed at men who have sex with men without a condom as well as others at high risk , including HIV-negative partners of individuals with HIV that is not virally suppressed Researchers are assessing demand for the drug and its effect on the number of new HIV infections ` Get a grip ' Phil Samba , of advocacy group Prepster , told BBC News that while the new data was incredibly promising , the lack of commitment from the government to making Prep widely available in England remained troubling . `` The figures show the impact that Prep , combined with increases in HIV testing and rapid access to HIV treatments can have . `` We truly are living in a new era of HIV prevention . `` Yet , Prep is still not freely available on the NHS in England and unnecessary HIV infections are happening because of foot-dragging by politicians . `` Today , we make a clear call to Matt Hancock and his colleagues , ` Get a grip and fund a full Prep service now . ' '' Late-stage infections Terrence Higgins Trust head of policy Debbie Laycock said a focus beyond communities stereotypically associated with HIV was now needed . `` The fact we are still seeing 43 % of all new HIV diagnoses at a late stage , in particular among heterosexual men and the over-50s , is evidence of the urgent need to engage these groups around HIV and regular testing .

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own . View more opinion at CNN . -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- In the Do n't - Mess-With Texas of yesteryear -LRB- and once upon a time in Hollywood -RRB- , if some tinhorn got caught cheating at a card table , maybe with an ace up his sleeve , he paid for it with some frontier justice . Texans did n't tolerate that kind of thing . I wonder whether they feel that way in Houston and other parts of the Lone Star State nowadays . I wonder this because I think a whole bunch of cheaters just got caught red-handed . And while some of them have been rounded up , brought to justice and sentenced -LRB- so to speak -RRB- , in my humble opinion -- I think in a lot of folks ' opinions -- these bad guys got off way too lightly . The desperados in question are the Houston Astros , winners of the 2017 World Series , who stand accused of using underhanded means to help them defeat the Los Angeles Dodgers for the first championship in Houston 's baseball history . Trouble is , nobody took away their loot . The championship trophy is still theirs . The banner can still wave . The history books are n't being rewritten . No one from the Dodgers is being given anything by their Major League Baseball partners except a sincere tip of the Stetson and them 's - the-breaks , pardner . I ca n't speak for all the townspeople of L.A. , but as far as I 'm concerned , their boys got hoodwinked . The law of Major League Baseball , represented by its commissioner , Rob Manfred , meted out what it believed to be a just punishment . First , he laid out in detail what the Astros did wrong . -LRB- Installed television monitors next to the dugout , stole the other team 's secret signals between the pitcher and catcher , banged on trash cans in an attempt to let a batter know what kind of pitch they thought was coming . -RRB- Next , he named a couple of ringleaders among the culprits : Jeff Luhnow , an executive in a suit who was the outfit 's general manager , and A.J. Hinch , the field manager who wore the same orange uniform his players did in Los Angeles on the night of Nov. 1 , 2017 , when the visiting Astros defeated the Dodgers in the seventh and final game of the World Series . He suspended the two men for a full year , whereupon Houston 's head honcho , team owner Jim Crane , promptly fired both . According to Manfred , there is no evidence Crane knew about what was going on . Manfred was n't done laying down the law . He ordered the Astros to fork over to baseball a fine of $ 5 million . He also stripped them of high picks in future MLB drafts of upcoming talent . Valuable picks like those had helped Houston mount the very team that took the championship . What sounds like harsh punishment was n't much punishment at all . Two men lost their jobs ; management figures in baseball do this all the time . Luhnow and Hinch are the scapegoats . Hinch in particular knew what was being done and did n't prevent it or report it , MLB said . Luhnow denied knowing about the conduct , and according to MLB , there was conflicting evidence about whether he knew , but chose to hold him responsible nonetheless , as the team 's general manager . Another coach , Alex Cora , was identified as a kind of mastermind of the scheme . Cora became the manager of the Boston Red Sox the following season and led them to the championship of the 2018 World Series . He is awaiting a punishment for his Houston actions , expected to be severe . Manfred said he is waiting for an investigation of the 2018 Red Sox to be completed before taking action against Cora , but on Tuesday night , Cora and the team `` mutually agreed to part ways , '' as the Sox put it on Twitter . And the $ 5 mil ? Big dough , to you and me . Chump change , to baseball . Pocket money . Players you 've never heard of make that in a year . Not a single Houston player , meanwhile , has gotten the heave-ho or lost a red cent . Everybody 's free to report back for duty in 2020 , either with the Astros or whomever their current employers might be . No suspensions , no recriminations , no accomplishments rescinded , no records corrected , no asterisks next to their stats . Reputations tarnished ? Aw , big deal . A home run on Opening Day and the fans in the stands will stand and give them a hand . Most of the position players on the 2017 team either got sign information or participated in the scheme by helping to decode signs themselves . Many interviewed admitted they knew the scheme was a violation of fair competition and the rules . These bad dudes basically got away with it . When eight players from the Chicago White Sox stood charged with losing the 1919 World Series on purpose , baseball 's commissioner banned them for life . They became infamous as the `` Black Sox '' for eternity , a smudge never removed from their reputations and names . Today , quite obviously , Orange is not the new Black Sox . I do n't see one of these orange-bellied Astros getting squeezed . Many of the very same cheaters will be right there in Minute Maid Park next season , signing autographs , posing for selfies . The diamond-studded rings on their fingers or in their safety deposit boxes will still have `` 2017 World Series Champions '' etched into them , forever and ever . Baseball is not dirt-free . Steroids , spitballs and corked bats have been utilized by players to unfair advantage . Punishments remain uneven . Pete Rose , who got more hits than anybody in MLB history , continues to serve a lifetime ban for having gambled on the outcomes of 20th century games while still in uniform . Alex Rodriguez , a confessed user of performance-enhancing drugs , remains a popular public figure and a baseball broadcast personality . I wish the game would play fair . Houston is n't getting away with murder , but most of their position players are definitely getting away with fraud . What a sham this once-proud organization has become . It was bad enough that one Astros player hit a home run in the 2017 World Series against pitcher Yu Darvish of the Dodgers , then was caught by cameras in the dugout making a vulgar gesture at the Japanese pitcher , tugging at the sides of his eyes . It was bad enough that an Astros assistant general manager got fired during the 2019 World Series for screaming profanely at a woman in the locker room , which his own boss denied until eyewitnesses attested to it . Cheating to win , though , whoa . How low can you go ? I bet there are baseball fans from Houston who do n't care what their boys did . They remain good guys in those folks ' eyes . But I bet there are still plenty of Texans to whom honor and decency and fair play are ideals to be proud of , ways they always want their sons and daughters to respect . I bet quite a few of these folks are ashamed of what those 2017 Houston Astros pulled . Justifiably so . The bad guys won .", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/15/opinions/houston-astros-cheating-scandal-downey/index.html", "kws": ["Astros", "Houston^^Astros", "baseball^^fans", "MLB^^history", "Major^^League^^Baseball", "Dodgers", "Houston", "cheaters", "Texans", "A.J.^^Hinch", "underhanded^^means", "pitcher^^Yu^^Darvish", "Hollywood", "Los^^Angeles^^Times", "Rob^^Manfred", "Reputations", "pitch", "performance-enhancing^^drugs", "harsh^^punishment", "CNN"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Baseball": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Baseball_MLB": 1.0}}}

Gay claims that the `` effort to destroy bail reform '' only `` really began to pick up steam '' with last month 's `` spike in anti-Semitic hate crimes . '' And `` The New York Post , true to character , helped things along by telling the story of Tiffany Harris '' -- who was released after allegedly attacking three Orthodox women , then was re-arrested the next day on charges of punching another woman . `` True to character '' : You think she 's referring to the fact that this newspaper , unlike hers , reports on street crime ? With Harris now being held for a psych evaluation , Gay suggests the case `` should prompt calls for increased funding of the state 's supervised-release programs . '' Funny , that 's among the fixes we 've demanded : `` Funds are likewise needed to boost pretrial services , '' we wrote back on July 14 . `` Supervised release programs provide mental-health counseling , '' we noted Oct. 9 , `` not that the Legislature added any funds for those programs '' when it ended bail . And we have long advocated for more help for the mentally ill . That 's why we 're fierce critics of ThriveNYC , which is wasting millions of dollars when it could be helping people like Harris . Of course , suspects with mental-health issues make up only some of the outrageous releases under the new law : Reporters across the state have found dozens of horror stories . But Gay does n't mention any other suspect except Harvey Weinstein -- who , she notes , had the resources to make bail . It 'd be unjust to jail Harris but not Harvey , she says . Yet if Weinstein did something while out on bail -- sexually harass another woman , say -- his bail would be rescinded and he 'd be locked up . Indeed , the judge at his trial has threatened to jail him for using his cellphone in court . But when Tiffany Harris commits the same crime she was just arrested for , there 's no cumulative effect . Judges have no discretion ; she 's let go again . These `` reforms '' were passed without any consultation with judges , prosecutors or police .

Transportation committees met Monday and Tuesday to begin weighing cuts , delays and other budget maneuvers to balance the state 's transportation budget after voters passed I-976 to cut vehicle registration fees . I-976 is expected to reduce state transportation revenue by about $ 454 million between 2019 and 2021 . While Gov. Jay Inslee attempts to make addressing homelessness and climate change cornerstones of this election-year legislative session , backfilling financial losses from I-976 will likely dominate transportation debates in the state House and Senate for much of the 60-day session . `` It 's a policy Rubik 's cube that I 'm in , '' Senate Transportation Chair Sen. Steve Hobbs , D-Lake Stevens , said in an interview before the session . I-976 attempted to lower many vehicle registration fees to $ 30 , repeal local car-tab taxes and roll back car-tab taxes that fund Sound Transit . In a lawsuit arguing the measure is unconstitutional , opponents sued and won a temporary halt to the measure . A final ruling -- and likely an appeal after that -- is still to come . Facing uncertainty about the measure 's fate , state lawmakers say they have to budget as if the cuts will take effect . Legislators ' starting place is Inslee 's proposed transportation budget , which would pause road , transit and rail projects across the state , shift costs among state transportation accounts and sell about $ 110 million to $ 120 million in bonds backed by gas-tax revenue . That strategy is already drawing skepticism from lawmakers . `` I keep looking at that word bonding and I 'm just worried and worried , '' Rep. Jim Walsh , R-Aberdeen , said Monday as he questioned state staff about the details . `` I think we can all agree that 's probably not the right thing to do , '' Hobbs told colleagues in a committee meeting Tuesday , `` and we 're going to have to make that -LSB- missing revenue -RSB- up . '' Inslee 's budget would also shift some transportation revenues and costs among different state accounts in an attempt to stave off severe cuts to the state 's multimodal account , which can fund non-roads projects like transit . For example , about $ 45 million to fund Washington State Ferries would come from the state 's motor vehicle account -LRB- which is funded in part by gas taxes -RRB- instead of from the multimodal account . Sales taxes paid on some state transportation construction projects would also be directed to the multimodal account to backfill lost funding . Lawmakers may consider shifting money from capital costs like buying new buses to operating costs , said House Transportation Committee Chair Rep. Jake Fey , D-Tacoma . `` That creates some harm , but it is not as damaging as having to cut service for special needs transportation . '' They may also consider `` triggering language '' that would reset transportation spending if the Supreme Court throws out I-976 , Hobbs said . Democrats , who hold majorities in both the House and Senate , are likely to dominate the budget debate and have said protecting transit service for people with disabilities is a top priority . But Republicans began the session emphasizing what they view as a public mandate to address car-tab taxes and fees . `` If it is n't this initiative , it might be another one , so we should be doing something , '' Senate Minority Leader Mark Schoesler , R-Ritzville , told reporters Tuesday . Republicans have proposed directing revenue from sales taxes on vehicle purchases to fund transportation costs . Inslee slammed that idea as a `` total nonstarter '' that would strip money from other state needs like education . Republican lawmakers have also filed bills to enact I-976 in full and nullify some Sound Transit taxes . They could also revive attempts to revamp the controversial way Sound Transit calculates car-tab taxes , which overvalues many vehicles compared to Kelley Blue Book . Democrats have floated some new funding sources , but acknowledge those could take more than one session to pass . A bill sponsored by Rep. Bill Ramos , D-Issaquah would allow local governments to pass new utility and sales taxes for certain transportation projects . Ramos said the bill was in the works before I-976 and is an effort to `` give local folks the opportunity to solve their own problems . '' Sen. Rebecca Salda\u00f1a , D-Seattle , said she is considering proposing new fees on yacht and private plane purchases and an `` air quality surcharge '' to be based on new vehicles ' projected emissions , but acknowledged those proposals could become part of a yearslong debate on a new transportation funding package .", "url": "http://www.chronline.com/northwest_regional_news/car-tab-fallout-dominates-as-transportation-leaders-return-to-olympia/article_66b85060-37f3-11ea-a8c2-4f1f3878f42b.html", "kws": ["car-tab^^taxes", "transportation^^spending", "state^^transportation^^revenue", "state^^lawmakers", "transportation^^costs", "transportation^^debates", "tax", "Republican^^lawmakers", "Transit", "Olympia", "Transportation^^committees", "Legislators", "transit^^service", "state^^transportation^^accounts", "Washington^^State^^Ferries", "gas^^taxes", "shift^^costs", "policy", "severe^^cuts", "Republicans"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 1.0000067949295044}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Municipal": 1.0000067949295044}}}

Houston fired AJ Hinch one hour after baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred released his findings Monday . Boston 's management took 30 hours to announce Alex Cora 's departure on Tuesday . Beltr\u00e1n remains in limbo , with the Mets refusing to say whether their new manager stays or goes . In Manfred 's nine-page statement , Beltr\u00e1n was the only player identified as a participant in the cheating scheme . `` They have to fire Carlos Beltr\u00e1n , '' a former New York Yankees teammate , Mark Teixeira , said Wednesday on ESPN , where he works as an analyst . `` There 's no way that Carlos Beltr\u00e1n , especially in the pressure cooker of New York , there 's no way he can be the manager of the Mets . ... You can not have that guy lead your team . `` The New York papers , the Daily News and the Post and all of the tabloids , will eat up Carlos Beltr\u00e1n every single day until he 's fired . '' Cora was Houston 's bench coach in 2017 and the instigator of the Astros ' use of a camera in center field and monitor near the dugout to steal catchers ' signals . `` Approximately two months into the 2017 season , a group of players , including Carlos Beltr\u00e1n , discussed that the team could improve on decoding opposing teams ' signs and communicating the signs to the batter , '' Manfred wrote . Hinch and Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow received one-season suspensions before owner Jim Crane fired them . Manfred decided not to discipline players -- 2017 was Beltr\u00e1n 's final season . Mets management must ponder whether Beltr\u00e1n can be an effective leader given his behavior . Would young players view him as a cheater pushing them to break the rules ? Would Beltr\u00e1n turn timid , afraid of attracting scrutiny from MLB investigators ? What would be the benefit of sticking with Beltr\u00e1n , who has no previous managerial experience ? Red Sox owner John Henry , chairman Tom Werner , CEO Sam Kennedy and chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom concluded Cora could not remain in Boston under similar circumstances . `` Alex by his own admission , and we agreed , played a central role in what went on in Houston , '' Werner said . `` We all agreed that it was wrong and that we had a responsibility as stewards , as John had said , to have a standard here where that sort of behavior is not acceptable . '' Kennedy said it was n't a close call . `` While it was difficult personally for a lot of people , professionally it was ultimately an easy decision for the Red Sox and for Alex. It was a mutual decision , '' Kennedy said . `` Alex came to the conclusion that he could not effectively lead the organization going forward in light of the commissioner 's findings and the ruling . And we came to that conclusion as well . '' With the start of spring training less than a month away , there is not much time to decide on a successor . Options could include new bench coach Hensley Meulens and ESPN analyst Eduardo P\u00e9rez , who interviewed for the Mets manager job with GM Brodie Van Wagenen last fall . Yanks address injuries Eric Cressey thinks some injuries can be prevented . After a season in which medical updates overshadowed scouting reports , the New York Yankees hope so . Cressey was hired by the Yankees in the new role of director of player health and performance , a move made after New York had 30 players make a combined 39 trips to the injured list last year . New York set a big league record for sidelined players , topping the 28 on the 2016 Los Angeles Dodgers . `` You always want to separate bad processes from bad outcomes , '' Cressey said . `` Players are going to be hit by pitches , but there are definitely things that we can do on the processes side of things to provide a level of individualization in the way that we solicit their feedback on what 's worked for them . '' Around the horn Left-hander Stephen Tarpley was traded from the Yankees to the Marlins on Wednesday for third baseman James Nelson and cash . Tarpley was designated for assignment by the Yankees on Saturday to clear a roster spot when outfielder Brett Gardner 's contract was finalized . The 26-year-old Tarpley was 1-0 with two saves and a 5.88 ERA last year . He was acquired by the Yankees in the 2016 trade that sent right-hander Iv\u00e1n Nova to Pittsburgh .

Cora would not be the former Red Sox manager today if he had n't been implicated by Major League Baseball in a pair of electronic sign-stealing schemes . His transgressions as bench coach of the Astros and , allegedly , in Boston certainly merited his departure Tuesday night . How the franchise moves forward promises to offer a stern test of character . Chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom never could have anticipated such a challenge so early in his tenure . The first formal statement issued by the club seemed to convey genuine emotion at being forced to reach such a conclusion . Wednesday 's press conference at Fenway Park brought more of the same for roughly 45 awkward minutes . Club CEO Sam Kennedy went out of his way on multiple occasions to use the phrase offered by the Red Sox on Tuesday . Boston and Cora `` mutually parted ways '' -- not a firing , not a resignation . `` It 's not ideal , '' Red Sox principal owner John Henry said . `` It 's not what we would like to be doing at this point . We were all surprised to read this report on Monday . '' Cora was named 11 times in the nine-page document released by MLB commissioner Rob Manfred to begin the week . Cora 's central role in Houston 's malfeasance brought both a personal dark cloud and one that threatened to linger over any future employer . The current MLB investigation into Boston 's 2018 champions could make Cora a two-time loser at Manfred 's office doorstep . `` Everyone acted in the best interests of the club and knew it was best to part ways , '' Kennedy said . `` -LRB- Cora -RRB- was remorseful . He apologized . '' The Red Sox had no choice . And it feels like they 're trying to give Cora an eventual chance to rehabilitate his career after he serves any potential upcoming ban from Major League Baseball . It speaks more to the human side of Cora and what he created in Boston than some of the actions that led to the end of his time here . To bestow that single label of cheater on Cora -- some sort of scarlet letter or all-encompassing epitaph for his brief tenure -- is to miss the point entirely . There are real psychological consequences to face for Red Sox staff members and players in the coming weeks and months . Cora 's two years with the club seemed to leave a personal connection not seen since Terry Francona was last at the helm in 2011 . `` My brother , more than my manager , you were a friend , a pana -LRB- pal -RRB- and advisor during these two years , '' Red Sox pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez posted on his personal Instagram page late Tuesday . `` I learned a lot from you . Thank you for everything . '' Hiring Cora to serve as Boston 's 47th manager started as an unquestioned triumph . The Red Sox were bringing in a winner , a well-liked former player who understood both the product on the field and the media game off it . Boston was also taking another significant step toward addressing its shameful overall record regarding race relations , with Cora representing its first manager of color . His debut season in 2018 was something out of a dream . Cora guided the Red Sox to a franchise-record 108 wins and playoff victories over the Yankees , Astros and Dodgers . That final Chris Sale strikeout of Manny Machado on an October night in Los Angeles seemed to make Boston immortal . In fact , it was the high point that preceded what has been a shocking 15-month fall from grace . What 's left behind most of all is uncertainty . Bloom is presiding over his first real managerial search . Players who were clearly aided by Cora 's uncanny motivational touch -- Rodriguez , Rafael Devers , Christian Vazquez and Xander Bogaerts come to mind -- will be forced to find common ground quickly with the fourth Red Sox manager in a decade . Despite being handsomely paid and accustomed to the vagabond 's existence that accompanies a life in professional sports , players have feelings . They bleed . They occasionally struggle for confidence . They 're still affected by success and failure just like the rest of us . Cora seemed preternaturally equipped to handle that part of the job . But it was his own thirst for victory -- his fatal professional flaw , as it turns out -- that led to his downfall . Boston 's acceptance of that fact began Wednesday afternoon , and its organizational future will be determined by what comes next . bkoch@providencejournal.com On Twitter : @BillKoch25", "url": "https://www.providencejournal.com/sports/20200115/bill-koch-cheater-yes-but-there-was-more-to-cora", "kws": ["Alex^^Cora", "cheater", "Bill^^Koch", "Sam^^Kennedy", "scarlet^^letter", "Rob^^Manfred", "BOSTON", "Red^^Sox", "grace", "Xander^^Bogaerts", "Chaim^^Bloom", "Eduardo^^Rodriguez", "Terry^^Francona", "Dodgers", "Major^^League^^Baseball", "feelings", "bench^^coach", "Christian^^Vazquez", "Astros", "Houston"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Baseball": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Baseball_MLB": 1.0}}}

The jury is out on this new corporate structure . `` MGM is shifting its focus from both an operator and real estate owner to an operator of gaming and leisure assets , '' said Macquarie Securities gaming analyst Chad Beynon . MGM is walking away with a combined $ 8.2 billion in cash from the sale/leaseback of Bellagio and the outright sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas in October , along with Tuesday 's deals , which includes $ 1.4 billion from real estate investment trust MGM Growth Properties . That part of the deal allows MGM Resorts to reduce its ownership stake in the REIT to 55 percent . Not only will MGM Resorts have the ability to reduce a sizeable chunk of its $ 15 billion in long-term debt and provide some capital return to shareholders , but it sets the company up for its long-stated development target -- winning the bidding process for an integrated resort license in Osaka , Japan , which could have a $ 10 billion to $ 12 billion price tag . `` MGM is amassing a mountain of cash , '' Union Gaming Group analyst John DeCree told investors , adding the figure could grow to $ 9.2 billion with addition of $ 1 billion of cash flow from the company 's U.S. operations . DeCree expects at least $ 6 billion will go toward debt reduction . He thought stock repurchases could reduce the number of MGM Resorts shares on the market by 20 % , making the remaining shares more valuable . `` We do believe the significance of the transaction is being underappreciated given the magnitude of value -LRB- and cash -RRB- being unlocked that will ultimately result in meaningful deleveraging and substantial share repurchase potential , '' DeCree said . Japan may be the ultimate prize . `` Ultimately , we view MGM 's real estate monetization strategy as effectively pre-funding the balance sheet for a potential Japan win , '' said SunTrust Bank gaming analyst Barry Jonas . `` It could be some time before investors are able to gauge the success of the ongoing asset-light initiative and the ultimate return on an Osaka new-build . '' MGM Resorts Chairman and CEO Jim Murren said the company is not done . MGM Springfield is probably the next target and he would like to sell the CityCenter stake . The 76 acres includes the 4,000-room Aria resort , two non-gaming hotels , an all-residential building and a luxury shopping mall . The land value has increased given the company 's redevelopment efforts on the Strip 's south end over the last few years . The Strip land value played out in the Bellagio and MGM Grand deals . MGM Resorts is paying annual rent of $ 245 million to operate the Bellagio and $ 290 million to operate MGM Grand and Mandalay Bay , whose ownership was transferred by MGM Growth into its new joint venture partnership with New York-based Blackstone Group . The sales equated to 17.3-times the Bellagio rent and 15.75-times the MGM Grand rent . Murren said the company 's new `` fortress balance sheet '' not only helps in the Japan push , but strengthens the company 's position as it pursues other opportunities , such as sports betting through Roar Digital , a partnership with UK-based GVC Holdings . On Wednesday , Roar Digital and the National Lacrosse League announced a gaming partnership . `` Our corporate objective remains crystal clear , '' Murren said . The question analysts ponder is if MGM 's `` asset-light '' strategy is good for other casino operators . The majority of Penn National Gaming 's 41 gaming properties are in lease agreements with Gaming and Leisure Properties -- which Penn spun off in 2013 -- and the Caesars Entertainment-centric VICI Properties . In 2018 , Boyd Gaming Corp acquired the operations of four Pinnacle Entertainment casinos with GLPI but has n't shown an interest in further REIT deals . The $ 17.3 billion acquisition of Caesars Entertainment by Eldorado Resort includes VICI . Jonas said Blackstone 's involvement in the MGM deals deal raises everyone interest and speculation about Las Vegas Strip real estate , such as the properties owned by Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands . Its less clear in `` lower end Strip assets '' and the regional markets . `` It remains to be seen if -LRB- there is -RRB- ` a rising tide lifts all boats ' here , '' Jonas said .

On Wednesday , City Council passed an ordinance limiting the city from assisting in immigration enforcement operations . However , questions remain about a Chicago Police Department agreement with Homeland Security . As City Council voted to strengthen the city 's sanctuary law , word of an agreement between Chicago police and the feds that could increase fear in the immigrant community . Last April , former CPD Supt. Eddie Johnson signed an agreement with Homeland Security that would allow the agency to deputize certain CPD employees . However , they are not allowed to enforce violations of immigration law . `` To say that ICE is going to deputize police officers , Chicago police officers to do investigations in place of what ICE does , it 's concerning , Ald . Ariel Reboyras , 30th Ward , said . Mayor Lightfoot stressed that immigrants in Chicago have nothing to fear . `` It specially states that they may not participate in ICE operations and the ordinance that passed today makes that abundantly clear , '' Lightfoot said . Ald . Gilbert Villegas also said there 's nothing to worry about . `` There has to be cooperation between CPD and homeland security , '' he said . `` I mean Chicago is the third largest city , I mean obviously would be a target for any type of terrorist group . And those are the type of services that the deputized CPD officers would be providing is ensuring that the city is safe from terrorists . '' Also Wednesday , was tense moments during debate about a study of LGBTQ businesses in Chicago . Some black alderman were concerned that set-asides for gay and transgender businesses could take away from programs designed to help other minorities . `` We want to make sure that everyone is included in whatever happens and not just one group or another , '' Alderman Jason Ervin 28th Ward , said . Lightfoot said it was shameful for a member of a community that gets discriminated against to `` give indulgence to offensive words spoken by somewhere else . '' `` It 's not the questions that are the problem . It is the content of the questions and the offensive nature of the tone and questions and the concerns that were expressed , '' she said . The mayor admonished black aldermen she said demonized the gay community .

To receive the newsletter in your inbox , sign up here . Chris Paul can feel the heat . The NBA 's seventh-place assist man of all time is in danger of being usurped . Perhaps not this season , but maybe next . And even as he congratulated his pursuer of reaching 9,000 career assists a few weeks ago , it came with a message to fall back as well . `` Happy 35th my brother @kingjames !! '' Paul posted on Instagram with a picture of LeBron . `` And how you go back to scoring and chill with all the assists !!!! '' LeBron James and Chris Paul are close friends , of course , and even if James is able to pass him in career assists -LRB- which at his current pace , he could do in 85 more games if both stick to their season averages -RRB- , it 's unlikely to affect their friendship . James said as much Wednesday morning as he talked about that milestone in particular , where he sits eighth all-time -LRB- 9,067 -RRB- behind Paul -LRB- 9,436 -RRB- after Monday 's blowout victory over the Cavaliers . `` If we 're able to hit a milestone throughout the course of this marathon , we acknowledge one another . We congratulate one another , '' James said . `` But it never goes to the trash-talking side . It 's never been in our DNA . It 's never been who we 've been about throughout our career since our brotherhood started . It 's pretty damn cool to see CP right there , I 'm right there in assists . '' James does n't talk at length about these milestones , and his line about his legacy is that he 'll take the time to appreciate it after his career is over . But it might be appropriate to consider some of the milestones LeBron is about to hit : -- An even closer milestone : James is in striking distance of third-place Kobe Bryant -LRB- 33,643 -RRB- on the all-time scoring list . If James adheres to his season average of 25.5 points per game , he 's on pace to pass Bryant on Jan. 25 against the Philadelphia 76ers ... a game which will be played in Bryant 's hometown . -- In that very same game , James -LRB- 47,560 -RRB- is on pace to enter the top 10 for minutes played , where he could surpass another NBA iron man in John Stockton , who played in all 82 regular-season games in 16 NBA seasons . Beyond Stockton , Wilt Chamberlain -LRB- 47,859 -RRB- and Kobe -LRB- 48,637 -RRB- are within reach this season . -- It might not happen this season , but James -LRB- 12,209 -RRB- is also in striking distance of Wilt -LRB- 12,681 -RRB- in all-time field goals after just passing Michael Jordan for fourth all-time . He 's got a long way to go to be the No. 1 all-time in this category ahead of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -LRB- 15,837 -RRB- , about four-and-a-half seasons if he can keep his career average of 9.9 FGs per game -LRB- which is likely to drop as time goes on -RRB- . -- Only one player , Steve Nash , has ever averaged more than 10 assists per game at age 35 or older -LRB- Nash did it three times -RRB- . If James can keep up his 10.7 league-leading average , he would become the second to do it while averaging nearly 10 points per game more than Nash did in his best scoring season over 35 . It 's a reflection of how long James has played , but the pace at which he 's approaching these milestones and blowing by them is also a reminder that he still seems very much in his prime . His scoring is down slightly , as is his rebounding and shooting percentage , but with the Lakers at 33-7 and his assist average higher than ever , you 'd be hard-pressed to say that he 's not one of the five most valuable players in the NBA right now . Even among the most storied players in NBA history to play well into their mid - to late-30s , that 's pretty much untouched air . It 's healthy to appreciate that we never might see this type of player passing these kinds of milestones for years to come . `` He 's just special . You know what I mean ? '' Coach Frank Vogel said Friday in Dallas . `` There 's not enough adjectives , really , to describe LeBron James . He 's a guy who 's going to be setting milestones or breaking records every few games , seemingly , probably , for the rest of his career . So it 's pretty awesome .

There 's an obvious reason to ask the big questions . Baseball is reeling from the fallout of sign-stealing investigations into the 2017 and 2018 World Series champions . On Monday , after being fined $ 5 million and ordered to forfeit four draft picks , the Astros fired their manager and general manager . The Red Sox fired their manager Tuesday , having already fired their general manager last September . This is already Major League Baseball 's most conspicuous scandal since 2005 , when some of its best players were hauled before Congress to discuss performance-enhancing drugs . The league has n't even released its findings from the Red Sox investigation yet . Now , MLB is reportedly planning to examine video replay rooms as a realm for illegal sign stealing . The report by Yahoo! Sports specified that the league is studying how replay rooms are policed . But the magnitude of this scandal is so large , a bigger question must be asked : can teams ' use of live feeds be policed at all ? A few days before Commissioner Rob Manfred disciplined the Astros , I was visiting Doug Latta 's batting cage in Northridge for a story . The private instructor has worked with Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner , retired first baseman Adrian Gonzalez , and more recently was credited with reviving Hunter Pence 's career by helping reshape Pence 's swing . When I arrived , Latta was working with a major-league client ; a few minutes later , another arrived . A minor league catcher followed . Another minor leaguer called Latta 's cell phone while the catcher was in the cage . After some college players floated through , the day ended with a 12-year-old taking some hacks . Latta does not lack for clients . He does lack for gizmos . There 's a pitching machine in the back of his cage , but that went unused while I watched . The facility holds nothing resembling wearable technology or bat sensors . Latta films his clients ' swings with a camera and will break down their mechanics frame-by-frame when they find it helpful . Some clients use a simple mirror as much as , or more than , the video . Too many gizmos collect too much useless information , Latta believes . `` The data , '' he said , `` is going to make it worse . '' Future generations of hitters might need some yet-to-emerge technology if they want to play baseball at the game 's highest level . For now , there are some very good major leaguers who require nothing more than a good coach , a mirror , a camera and a monitor to get their swing right . This was the preferred boundary for hitting technology on one afternoon , at one facility . The limits on which team employees should be privy to live in-game feeds , and the extent to which 21st-century technologies are needed to coach hitters , are grounds for debate . The answer lies in some gray area . Smart people can agree to disagree . That 's usually the case with debates that affect baseball , and sports , and the human condition in general . The same is not true for electronic balls and strikes . In the future , either the umpire will have the authority to make the final call or he will not . If he does , you will be watching the game of baseball as we know it today . If he does not -- if the strike zone is determined by some electronic entity -- the game will be dramatically different , if not unrecognizable . I did n't reach that conclusion quickly . One of the featured speakers at this year 's American Baseball Coaches ' Association convention in Nashville was Ryan Sienko , the Dodgers ' catching coordinator . Sienko did n't dedicate any portion of his presentation to electronic balls and strikes . But some of the coaches who heard Sienko 's talk -- the total numbered in the thousands by his own estimate -- asked him about it afterward . If MLB moved to a system of automated balls and strikes , Sienko said , `` it would just strip away so much . '' Begin with base stealing . Catchers crouch behind home plate in order to present pitches to an umpire standing behind them . The crouch is useful to an umpire 's sightlines , but not ideal for throwing out attempted base-stealers . If the umpire does n't need to see each pitch as it crosses home plate , astute teams will position their catchers however they need to throw out runners . Goodbye , crouch . Coincidentally , when the independent Atlantic League tested an automated ball/strike system last season , it instituted a rule allowing the batter to run to first base after any passed ball or wild pitch -- to `` steal first base , '' if you will . `` If they do n't put that -LRB- rule -RRB- in there , you can basically have your -LRB- catchers -RRB- get out of the way , '' Sienko said . `` You do n't have to even catch -LRB- the baseball -RRB- . If there 's no one on base , there 's no real reason for you to catch it . You 're just standing there retrieving the ball after each pitch . It can become a 100 percent offensive position . '' In the Arizona Fall League last October , one batter was ejected for arguing after a pitch was caught inches above the ground and called a strike . The pitch was difficult to hit , or at least hit well , but a calibrated computer determined it passed through the batter 's strike zone . The Fall League is populated by minor leaguers . A typical major league pitcher has elite command and could be expected to exploit the limits of an electronic strike zone even further . That would ultimately have an adverse effect on offense . It 's another point in favor of allowing hitters to `` steal '' first base on any ball that gets past the catcher , regardless of the count . It could be a necessary avenue for game action , for allowing runners to reach base . Back to the Atlantic League . When it allowed hitters to steal first , a funny thing happened . Some of them chose to ignore the rule . They pretended it did n't exist . `` Most guys feel that it 's bush league , '' journeyman catcher James Skelton told ESPN in August . Times change , and so do the accepted norms of a sport . Think about the de-emphasis on pitchers `` brushing back '' a hitter with inside pitches , or sliding hard into a fielder standing at second , third , or home plate . The norms guiding these behaviors changed over time . In some cases , the rules did too . In other cases , no rule change was needed . Maybe Atlantic League players will someday decide it 's OK to run to first base on any count ; maybe they wo n't . What does all of this mean for MLB ? The league did n't believe the first-base rule was a necessary companion to the automated strike zone when it tested both rules in the Atlantic League . Sienko believes it is . If he 's right , we can call it a secondary consequence of a rule -LRB- a computer has the final say over balls and strikes -RRB- that was the secondary consequence of a technological advancement -LRB- calibrating a radar to detect strike zones with greater accuracy than humans -RRB- . This is the perfect example of why MLB needs to ask the big questions about who calls balls and strikes now , knowing teams and players will exploit every advantage a new system would create . What are the secondary consequences ? What are the tertiary consequences ? Sienko has thought of some . Certainly , there are others . We might ultimately learn , like Latta 's spartan batting cage and any replay room within earshot of a major league dugout , that in baseball less is sometimes more .", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2020/01/15/is-technology-bumping-against-its-limits-in-baseball/", "kws": ["Major^^League^^Baseball", "MLB", "Dodgers", "Astros", "Major^^League", "base^^stealing", "technology", "gizmos", "inside^^pitches", "attempted^^base-stealers", "performance-enhancing^^drugs", "earshot", "rule", "coach^^hitters", "Red^^Sox", "The^^league", "strike^^zones", "Atlantic^^League^^players", "Smart^^people", "Catchers^^crouch"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Baseball": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Baseball_MLB": 1.0}}}

In a rare twist Wednesday , however , everyone at Scotiabank Arena -- home of the always-in-the-spotlight Toronto Maple Leafs -- wanted to talk about the Battle of Alberta . Several days after the fact , the bad blood -LRB- and back-and-forth banter -RRB- between Calgary 's Matthew Tkachuk and Edmonton 's Zack Kassian remains one of the hottest topics in the sport , a story that still has legs after the now-suspended Oilers forward told reporters that the Flames ' youngster `` messed with the wrong guy '' in a not-so-subtle promise of revenge when the provincial rivals meet again later this month . `` -LRB- Kassian -RRB- speaks what 's on his mind whether there is a microphone in front of him or not , '' said Flames forward Milan Lucic , ex of the Oilers and with a reputation as one of the NHL 's toughest customers , choosing his words carefully . `` He is one of those guys that plays with emotion , lives with emotion . That 's the type of guy he is . I had fun being his teammate for three years , but when push comes to shove , Matt is my teammate and I ` d do whatever I have to to step up for him . '' Thing is , as Lucic and several others stressed on Wednesday , the next push and shove and whatever else occurs between the Flames and the Oilers does n't go down until Jan. 29 in Edmonton . As Calgary 's interim skipper , Geoff Ward , put it : `` We have a lot of hockey to play before we get back to the Battle of Alberta , and we have to make sure that our heads are in the games that we 're playing . '' Everybody understands why the Tkachuk-Kassian feud is such a sexy storyline . We 've been waiting years , decades maybe , for the Flames-Oilers rivalry to rev up again . That happened Saturday , when Tkachuk laid a hat-trick of thunderous hits on Kassian , who came up swinging after the second but could n't convince the Flames ' alternate captain and fan favourite to dance . Shortly after the final buzzer , Tkachuk continued to poke the bear by saying , `` if he does n't want to get hit , then stay off the tracks . '' Down the hall , Kassian called his enemy a `` young punk '' and countered , `` if you 're going to hit like that , you have to answer the bell every once in a while . '' After being slapped with a two-game suspension , Kassian told the media Tuesday , `` I do n't think -LRB- Tkachuk -RRB- realizes that we 're in the same division . I have a great memory . '' And so the following day , as Auston Matthews & Co. skated at their in practice facility in Etobicoke , Ont. , any reporters who showed up at Scotiabank Arena were wondering how the Flames would respond . -LRB- Tkachuk did not speak to the media . -RRB- It 's not often the skating stars are trying to steer the conversation back to the Maple Leafs , but that was exactly the case . `` We 're in Toronto , we 're playing Toronto tomorrow and we 're getting ready for that , '' reminded Flames captain Mark Giordano . `` But obviously , Chucky is one of our top players and we have his back . He 's our teammate . And whatever presents itself , presents itself in that game , but that 's a long way away . '' Kassian can look ahead to that Jan. 29 rematch between the Oilers and Flames . After all , thanks to his two-game sit-out for his walloping of a guy who was n't willing to drop his mitts , he 's not eligible to play until that instalment of the Battle of Alberta . Tkachuk & Co. , on the other hand , have more immediate business . They face the Maple Leafs in Thursday 's matchup -LRB- 5 p.m. MT , Sportsnet West/Sportsnet 960 The Fan -RRB- . They 'll hit Ottawa next for Saturday 's showdown against the Senators , then see how they stack up against the reigning Stanley Cup champs from St. Louis in their first date after the bye/all-star break . They 're currently trying to regroup after their five-game winning streak ended with a thud in Monday 's 2-0 shutout against the Canadiens . `` Personally , I think our focus is a little too much on that , '' Lucic said of the Battle of Alberta aftermath . `` You saw us go into Montreal on Monday night and all we were talking about is what happened on Saturday , and we do n't come out to play a game on Monday the way we should , because we 're still talking about Saturday . And those two points were just as big as the ones that we got on Saturday , so there 's almost too much focus on one thing when our focus right now should be on the Maple Leafs and what we have to do to win a hockey game . `` And to be honest , guys are going to say what they 're going to say and do what they 're going to do . I know , for a fact , everyone has each other 's backs in this locker-room . And when the time comes , whatever score needs to be settled will be settled . But I think our main focus and energy needs to be on the Maple Leafs and what we need to do to win a hockey game . '' `` Talk is just talk . Whatever score needs to be settled , we can focus on that when we play -LRB- the Oilers -RRB- next . '' In the meantime , they 'd rather talk about something else . Anything else , really . Hey , how about them Maple Leafs ? `` The whole through-the-media and all this back-and-forth , what 's it going to prove until we play them ? '' Giordano said . `` We have -LRB- three -RRB- games that we have to worry about before we play the Oilers again . So we have to put them way in the back of our head -- like , way in the back of our mind -- now and worry about it when the time comes .

The big Japanese import illustrated that makeup during his introductory media conference on Wednesday by saying he aims to live his dream of playing in the majors as a starter . Yamaguchi , signed to a two-year , $ 6.3-million US deal last month , was both a successful closer and a solid starter during his 14 seasons with Yokohama and Yomiuri in Japan , but has been a starter since partway through 2014 and wants to keep taking the mound every five days . `` For spring training what I 'm aiming for is to win a spot in the rotation as a starter , '' Yamaguchi said on Wednesday through translator Hideaki Sato , Toronto 's head of Pacific Rim operations . The Blue Jays have been busy this winter in shoring up a rotation that featured a team-record 21 different starters in 2019 . Hyun-Jin Ryu is the ace , fellow newcomers Tanner Roark and Chase Anderson should slot in behind him and veteran Matt Shoemaker is considered somewhat of a lock too , if healthy . That means Yamaguchi probably will be battling for just one available spot with the likes of Trent Thornton -LRB- who general manager Ross Atkins said Wednesday deserves a fair shot of his own after a decent season -RRB- , Ryan Borucki -LRB- who should be healthy after a lost campaign -RRB- , young Anthony Kay and potentially others . Later in the season , Nate Pearson could also arrive on the scene . Pearson was recently named the No. 2 right-handed pitching prospect in all of baseball . Yamaguchi has made his intentions clear , but added he will be open to seeing how it all plays out . `` I understand in a team situation , when the time comes , sometimes , we have to be flexible and -LRB- if -RRB- that happens , I 'm ready for that too , '' he said . `` He 'll come in trying to win a rotation spot . Based on the performance in that small snapshot , the health of others , we 'll see where we are at the end of Spring Training , '' Atkins said . `` The versatility , having been in the ` pen before , is an added benefit -LRB- of the signing -RRB- . '' Yamaguchi said he remade himself as a starter when he lost his job as the closer in Yokohama during a rough 2015 campaign . He went 11-5 with a 2.86 ERA in 2016 , 9-9 with a 3.69 ERA in 2018 after a truncated 2017 season and 16-4 with a 2.78 ERA in a career-high 181 innings pitched in 2019 . Yamaguchi struck out 194 batters in those innings and walked only 64 . He said he intends to continue being a power pitcher . `` His experiences , his pedigree in the -LRB- Japanese league -RRB- , really pointed to us feeling very good about this transition , '' Atkins said . `` We 're extremely confident the overall talent will translate well into Major League Baseball . '' Yamaguchi flashed a clear sense of humour at times , drawing chuckles from those on hand right off of the bat when he said : `` Hello , bonjour , Konnichiwa . Nice to meet you , '' covering all of his bases . He also quipped about his first impressions of the city : `` It 's cold weather here in Toronto , but the people are very warm and welcoming and I really like that . '' But the biggest zinger came when he was asked why he chose baseball instead of following in the footsteps of his father , Hisashi , who was a well-known sumo wrestler . `` I started thinking about -LRB- being -RRB- in public showing my butt , '' Yamaguchi said . `` So as I got older , that 's why I decided to pursue baseball . '' Yamaguchi has been meeting a few teammates and plans to stay in town for a few more days to work out . He also asked Atkins if he could participate in the coming Fan Fest and was met with an approving nod . Atkins said he is extremely pleased overall about how the busy off-season has unfolded for the Blue Jays , but said while additional help in the bullpen is probably the most likely pending additions , he did n't rule out `` something of significant impact '' likely coming via a trade . That does n't mean a deal will happen for sure , just that the Jays remain open for business and are no longer afraid to be a bit bold .

Wayde Douglas Bowles -- between known as Rocky `` Soul Man '' Johnson -- has passed away , the WWE announced on Wednesday afternoon . He was 75 . Highly regarded as the first African-American World Tag Team Champion in WWE history , The Soul Patrol member earned his spot in the beloved sport . And while he retired from wrestling in 1991 , he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2008 by his son Dwayne `` The Rock '' Johnson . In fact , Dwayne often talked fondly of his father who supported his own career in the WWE . A perfect example was in March 2019 when the actor expressed how he wanted to buy his dad a new house . `` I called my dad and I said , ` Look , you 're probably happy where you 're at but I want to do something for you . I want to buy you a brand-new home , wherever you want to live , you can live , ' '' Dwayne shared on Instagram . `` My dad 's an old-school tough guy , I said , ` What the hell are you nervous about ? ' And he said , ` Well , ' he was searching for words . ` No one ever called to tell me they were gon na buy me a house before and the fact that it 's you , it 's my son , I 'm so proud of you and I love you so much .

Well for my pops that path started at 13yrs old when his mom kicked him out of his house on Christmas day and forced him to live on the streets -LRB- very true and fucked up story -RRB- so his reality of compassion and love was forged thru pain and toughness . He raised me with that tough physical love and used to beat my ass in the gyms and on wrestling mats . I hated it then as a little boy , but grateful for it today as a man .

For that I 'm grateful and this one felt good . Crazy how full circle life can come .

It just felt good to kind of give back to the ones who raised you . So , love you too , Pop . '' Father-son relationships aside , the WWE could n't help but describe Rocky as `` wildly charismatic '' when looking back on his career that began in the mid-1960 's .

To receive the newsletter in your inbox , sign up here . Chris Paul can feel the heat . The NBA 's seventh-place assist man of all time is in danger of being usurped . Perhaps not this season , but maybe next . And even as he congratulated his pursuer of reaching 9,000 career assists a few weeks ago , it came with a message to fall back as well . `` Happy 35th my brother @kingjames !! '' Paul posted on Instagram with a picture of LeBron . `` And how you go back to scoring and chill with all the assists !!!! '' LeBron James and Chris Paul are close friends , of course , and even if James is able to pass him in career assists -LRB- which at current pace , he could do in 85 more games if both stick to their season averages -RRB- , it 's unlikely to affect their friendship . James said as much Wednesday morning as he talked about that milestone in particular , where he sits eighth all-time -LRB- 9,067 -RRB- behind Paul -LRB- 9,436 -RRB- after Monday 's blowout over the Cavaliers . `` If we 're able to hit a milestone throughout the course of this marathon , we acknowledge one another . We congratulate one another , '' James said . `` But it never goes to the trash talking side . It 's never been in our DNA . It 's never been who we 've been about throughout our career since our brotherhood started . It 's pretty damn cool to see CP right there , I 'm right there in assists . '' James does n't talk at length about these milestones , and his line about his legacy is that he 'll take the time to appreciate it after his career is over . But it might be appropriate to consider some of the milestones LeBron is about to hit : -- An even closer milestone : James is in striking distance of third-place Kobe Bryant -LRB- 33,643 -RRB- on the all-time scoring list . If James adheres to his season average of 25.5 points per game , he 's on pace to pass Bryant on Jan. 25 against the Philadelphia 76ers ... which will be played in Bryant 's hometown . -- In that very same game , James -LRB- 47,560 -RRB- is on pace to enter the top 10 of minutes played , where he could surpass another NBA iron man in John Stockton , who played in 82 games in 16 NBA seasons . Beyond Stockton , Wilt Chamberlain -LRB- 47,859 -RRB- and Kobe -LRB- 48,637 -RRB- are within reach this season . -- It might not happen this season , but James -LRB- 12,209 -RRB- is also in striking distance of Wilt -LRB- 12,681 -RRB- in all-time field goals after just passing Michael Jordan for fourth all-time . He 's got a long way to go to be the No. 1 all-time in this category ahead of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -LRB- 15,837 -RRB- , about four-and-a-half seasons if he can keep his career average of 9.9 FGs per game -LRB- which is likely to drop as time goes on -RRB- . -- Only one player , Steve Nash , has ever averaged more than 10 assists per game at age 35 or older -LRB- Nash did it three times -RRB- . If James can keep up his 10.7 league-leading average , he would become the second to do it while averaging nearly 10 points per game more than Nash did in his best scoring season over 35 . It 's a reflection of how long James has played , but the pace at which he 's approaching these milestones and blowing by them is also a reminder that he still seems very much in his prime . His scoring is down slightly , as is his rebounding and shooting percentage , but with the Lakers at 33-7 and his assist average higher than ever , you 're hard-pressed to say that he 's not one of the five most valuable players in the NBA right now . Even among the most storied players in NBA history to play well into their mid - and late-30s , that 's pretty much untouched air . It 's healthy to appreciate that we never might see this type of player passing these kinds of milestones for years to come . `` He 's just special . You know what I mean ? '' Frank Vogel said Friday in Dallas . `` There 's not enough adjectives , really , to describe LeBron James . He 's a guy that 's going to be setting milestones or breaking records every few games , seemingly , probably , for the rest of his career . So it 's pretty awesome .

There 's an obvious reason to ask the big questions . Baseball is reeling from the fallout of sign-stealing investigations into the 2017 and 2018 World Series champions . On Monday , after being fined $ 5 million and ordered to forfeit four draft picks , the Astros fired their manager and general manager . The Red Sox fired their manager Tuesday , having already fired their general manager last September . This is already Major League Baseball 's most conspicuous scandal since 2005 , when some of its best players were hauled before Congress to discuss performance-enhancing drugs . The league has n't even released its findings from the Red Sox investigation yet . Now , MLB is reportedly planning to examine video replay rooms as a realm for illegal sign stealing . The report by Yahoo! Sports specified that the league is studying how replay rooms are policed . But the magnitude of this scandal is so large , a bigger question must be asked : can teams ' use of live feeds be policed at all ? A few days before Commissioner Rob Manfred disciplined the Astros , I was visiting Doug Latta 's batting cage in Northridge for a story . The private instructor has worked with Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner , retired first baseman Adrian Gonzalez , and more recently was credited with reviving Hunter Pence 's career by helping reshape Pence 's swing . When I arrived , Latta was working with a major-league client ; a few minutes later , another arrived . A minor league catcher followed . Another minor leaguer called Latta 's cell phone while the catcher was in the cage . After some college players floated through , the day ended with a 12-year-old taking some hacks . Latta does not lack for clients . He does lack for gizmos . There 's a pitching machine in the back of his cage , but that went unused while I watched . The facility holds nothing resembling wearable technology or bat sensors . Latta films his clients ' swings with a camera and will break down their mechanics frame-by-frame when they find it helpful . Some clients use a simple mirror as much as , or more than , the video . Too many gizmos collect too much useless information , Latta believes . `` The data , '' he said , `` is going to make it worse . '' Future generations of hitters might need some yet-to-emerge technology if they want to play baseball at the game 's highest level . For now , there are some very good major leaguers who require nothing more than a good coach , a mirror , a camera and a monitor to get their swing right . This was the preferred boundary for hitting technology on one afternoon , at one facility . The limits on which team employees should be privy to live in-game feeds , and the extent to which 21st-century technologies are needed to coach hitters , are grounds for debate . The answer lies in some gray area . Smart people can agree to disagree . That 's usually the case with debates that affect baseball , and sports , and the human condition in general . The same is not true for electronic balls and strikes . In the future , either the umpire will have the authority to make the final call or he will not . If he does , you will be watching the game of baseball as we know it today . If he does not -- if the strike zone is determined by some electronic entity -- the game will be dramatically different , if not unrecognizable . I did n't reach that conclusion quickly . One of the featured speakers at this year 's American Baseball Coaches ' Association convention in Nashville was Ryan Sienko , the Dodgers ' catching coordinator . Sienko did n't dedicate any portion of his presentation to electronic balls and strikes . But some of the coaches who heard Sienko 's talk -- the total numbered in the thousands by his own estimate -- asked him about it afterward . If MLB moved to a system of automated balls and strikes , Sienko said , `` it would just strip away so much . '' Begin with base stealing . Catchers crouch behind home plate in order to present pitches to an umpire standing behind them . The crouch is useful to an umpire 's sightlines , but not ideal for throwing out attempted base-stealers . If the umpire does n't need to see each pitch as it crosses home plate , astute teams will position their catchers however they need to throw out runners . Goodbye , crouch . Coincidentally , when the independent Atlantic League tested an automated ball/strike system last season , it instituted a rule allowing the batter to run to first base after any passed ball or wild pitch -- to `` steal first base , '' if you will . `` If they do n't put that -LRB- rule -RRB- in there , you can basically have your -LRB- catchers -RRB- get out of the way , '' Sienko said . `` You do n't have to even catch -LRB- the baseball -RRB- . If there 's no one on base , there 's no real reason for you to catch it . You 're just standing there retrieving the ball after each pitch . It can become a 100 percent offensive position . '' In the Arizona Fall League last October , one batter was ejected for arguing after a pitch was caught inches above the ground and called a strike . The pitch was difficult to hit , or at least hit well , but a calibrated computer determined it passed through the batter 's strike zone . The Fall League is populated by minor leaguers . A typical major league pitcher has elite command and could be expected to exploit the limits of an electronic strike zone even further . That would ultimately have an adverse effect on offense . It 's another point in favor of allowing hitters to `` steal '' first base on any ball that gets past the catcher , regardless of the count . It could be a necessary avenue for game action , for allowing runners to reach base . Back to the Atlantic League . When it allowed hitters to steal first , a funny thing happened . Some of them chose to ignore the rule . They pretended it did n't exist . `` Most guys feel that it 's bush league , '' journeyman catcher James Skelton told ESPN in August . Times change , and so do the accepted norms of a sport . Think about the de-emphasis on pitchers `` brushing back '' a hitter with inside pitches , or sliding hard into a fielder standing at second , third , or home plate . The norms guiding these behaviors changed over time . In some cases , the rules did too . In other cases , no rule change was needed . Maybe Atlantic League players will someday decide it 's OK to run to first base on any count ; maybe they wo n't . What does all of this mean for MLB ? The league did n't believe the first-base rule was a necessary companion to the automated strike zone when it tested both rules in the Atlantic League . Sienko believes it is . If he 's right , we can call it a secondary consequence of a rule -LRB- a computer has the final say over balls and strikes -RRB- that was the secondary consequence of a technological advancement -LRB- calibrating a radar to detect strike zones with greater accuracy than humans -RRB- . This is the perfect example of why MLB needs to ask the big questions about who calls balls and strikes now , knowing teams and players will exploit every advantage a new system would create . What are the secondary consequences ? What are the tertiary consequences ? Sienko has thought of some . Certainly , there are others . We might ultimately learn , like Latta 's spartan batting cage and any replay room within earshot of a major league dugout , that in baseball less is sometimes more .", "url": "https://www.sbsun.com/2020/01/15/is-technology-bumping-against-its-limits-in-baseball/", "kws": ["Major^^League^^Baseball", "MLB", "Dodgers", "Astros", "Major^^League", "base^^stealing", "technology", "gizmos", "inside^^pitches", "attempted^^base-stealers", "performance-enhancing^^drugs", "earshot", "rule", "coach^^hitters", "Red^^Sox", "The^^league", "strike^^zones", "Atlantic^^League^^players", "Smart^^people", "Catchers^^crouch"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Baseball": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Baseball_MLB": 1.0}}}

Johnson , born Wayde Douglas Bowles , started his career in the 1960 's in the National Wrestling Alliance . He also appeared on Big Time Wrestling , a promotion that taped shows across California , including at KTXL in Sacramento . His career with the WWE began in 1983 , where he was one half of the World Champion Tag Team duo known as The Soul Patrol alongside Tony Atlas . The Soul Patrol were the first African-American World Tag Team Champions in WWE history . Johnson retired in 1991 and would go on to train his son , who became a pro wrestling icon as The Rock before making the transition to acting . The Soulman was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2008 . View this post on Instagram Bought my dad a Christmas gift and surprised him . He 's had a hard life . This one felt good . My dad , Rocky Johnson is a minimalist . Always has been . Never asks me for much and over the years his needs are always the barest . Crazy story , my dad 's dad died when he was 13yrs old . That Christmas , my dad 's mom had her new boyfriend over for Christmas dinner . Her boyfriend got drunk and pissed on the turkey . My dad went outside , got a shovel , drew a line in the snow and said if you cross that line I 'll kill you . The drunk crossed it and my dad laid him out cold as a block of ice . Cops were called . They told my dad 's mom that when her boyfriend regains consciousness , he 's gon na kill your son so one of them has got to go . In front of the entire family , my dad 's mom looked at him and said get out . He was 13yrs old and now homeless . That f*cked up true story happened in Amherst , Nova Scotia , Canada in 1954 . He needed the bare minimum then , just like does now . Over the years , I 've moved him into a big home , got him trucks to drive - which he 'll literally drive into the ground until I get him something else . Hell , I 'll get him anything he wants , but the SOB just wo n't ask ;-RRB- . Every Christmas , I always think about that story and my dad having every odd stacked against him at 13 , but he fought thru it and still made something of himself . Makes me appreciate his struggle and hard work . Also , makes me appreciate the fun times he would beat my ass in the gym so bad when I was 13 and say `` If you 're gon na throw up , go outside . . and if you 're gon na cry , then go home to your mother '' . I hated it then , but I embrace it now . Made a man outta me . Without pissing on my turkey . .

But in this week 's episode of ` Married at First Sight , ' no seems to be complaining as the husbands will be shown helping their wives change out of the wedding dresses . This comes as a surprise because , in the days leading up to the wedding and minutes before the brides were to walk the aisle , everyone seemed uncertain and could n't figure if they were making the right decision for themselves . Previously , when the girls met for the first time they had an elaborate discussion about their wedding night , during which Katie and Mindy openly communicated about their interest in going through with it . While Taylor and Jessica said they 'd take time to open up to their husbands because they 'd be getting close for the first time . Interestingly , in tonight 's episode , we see Taylor initiating a conversation with Brandon , asking him to help her get out of the dress and Jessica directing Austin down her dress so that he can unbutton it . Meanwhile , Derek gets grilled by Katie 's friends who inquire about his plans for the night , leaving him completely flushed . Later , they are seen getting into an embrace and kissing each other . Clearly , no one 's taking the couch tonight , which is a good sign because it indicates they are all over their initial awkwardness ready to begin their happily ever afters . But fans have already judged the five couples -- Mindy & Zach , Taylor & Brandon , Jessica & Austin , Katie & Derek , and Meka & Michael -- who are all set to start a new chapter on the show . `` We need to get rid of Katie and give Derek a real chance , '' a fan wrote . `` I 'm seeing `` I 'm too sexy '' , vibes from Zach . His friends mentioned physical attraction twice Mindy , i.e. Nancy Kerrigan may be a figure skater but his top priority seems to be looks so I picture this going downhill fast if he ca n't embrace her other qualities #MarriedAtFirstSight , '' another fan wrote . `` I think Taylor & Brandon will definitely make it , he 's so cute .

And while he retired from wrestling in 1991 , he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2008 by his son Dwayne `` The Rock '' Johnson . In fact , Dwayne often talked fondly of his father who supported his own career in the WWE . A perfect example was in March 2019 when the actor expressed how he wanted to buy his dad a new house . `` I called my dad and I said , ` Look , you 're probably happy where you 're at but I want to do something for you . I want to buy you a brand-new home , wherever you want to live , you can live , ' '' Dwayne shared on Instagram . `` My dad 's an old-school tough guy , I said , ` What the hell are you nervous about ? ' And he said , ` Well , ' he was searching for words . ` No one ever called to tell me they were gon na buy me a house before and the fact that it 's you , it 's my son , I 'm so proud of you and I love you so much . ' '' View this post on Instagram Great chat with my old man . Felt good to my cold to hear him express his love . He 's a weathered soul and like all weathered souls , there 's often a harsh storied path that got them there . Well for my pops that path started at 13yrs old when his mom kicked him out of his house on Christmas day and forced him to live on the streets -LRB- very true and fucked up story -RRB- so his reality of compassion and love was forged thru pain and toughness . He raised me with that tough physical love and used to beat my ass in the gyms and on wrestling mats . I hated it then as a little boy , but grateful for it today as a man .

Sponsored Links The most addicting World War 3 strategy game Conflict of Nations | Dorado Games Middle East turmoil stirs up markets E * TRADE You 'd think that splashing out for the Porsche Taycan Turbo S would deliver some extra range in addition to the improved acceleration -LRB- as you get with rivals like Tesla -RRB- , but that 's apparently not the case . The EPA has rated the top-spec model 's range at just 192 miles -- that 's less than the already modest 201 miles of the regular Turbo . Given that the Turbo S currently starts at $ 188,960 after delivery and handling fees , you 're not getting much longevity for the money . For context , the current Tesla Model S Performance sells for $ 99,990 with slightly faster acceleration -LRB- 0-60MPH in 2.4 seconds versus 2.6 -RRB- and an EPA-estimated 348-mile range . There are still reasons you 'd consider the Taycan over the Model S , and not just for that Porsche badging . The Taycan may not be quite as fast , but it delivers more sustainable performance . You can thrash around the track or drag strip for a long time without losing your edge . Our early testing suggests there 's nimbler handling , too . And while you can get some posh interior options for the Model S , there 's little doubt that the Taycan has a fancier cabin with perks like Apple CarPlay . Still , range is range .

To receive the newsletter in your inbox , sign up here . Chris Paul can feel the heat . The NBA 's seventh-place assist man of all time is in danger of being usurped . Perhaps not this season , but maybe next . And even as he congratulated his pursuer of reaching 9,000 career assists a few weeks ago , it came with a message to fall back as well . `` Happy 35th my brother @kingjames !! '' Paul posted on Instagram with a picture of LeBron . `` And how you go back to scoring and chill with all the assists !!!! '' LeBron James and Chris Paul are close friends , of course , and even if James is able to pass him in career assists -LRB- which at current pace , he could do in 85 more games if both stick to their season averages -RRB- , it 's unlikely to affect their friendship . James said as much Wednesday morning as he talked about that milestone in particular , where he sits eighth all-time -LRB- 9,067 -RRB- behind Paul -LRB- 9,436 -RRB- after Monday 's blowout over the Cavaliers . `` If we 're able to hit a milestone throughout the course of this marathon , we acknowledge one another . We congratulate one another , '' James said . `` But it never goes to the trash talking side . It 's never been in our DNA . It 's never been who we 've been about throughout our career since our brotherhood started . It 's pretty damn cool to see CP right there , I 'm right there in assists . '' James does n't talk at length about these milestones , and his line about his legacy is that he 'll take the time to appreciate it after his career is over . But it might be appropriate to consider some of the milestones LeBron is about to hit : -- An even closer milestone : James is in striking distance of third-place Kobe Bryant -LRB- 33,643 -RRB- on the all-time scoring list . If James adheres to his season average of 25.5 points per game , he 's on pace to pass Bryant on Jan. 25 against the Philadelphia 76ers ... which will be played in Bryant 's hometown . -- In that very same game , James -LRB- 47,560 -RRB- is on pace to enter the top 10 of minutes played , where he could surpass another NBA iron man in John Stockton , who played in 82 games in 16 NBA seasons . Beyond Stockton , Wilt Chamberlain -LRB- 47,859 -RRB- and Kobe -LRB- 48,637 -RRB- are within reach this season . -- It might not happen this season , but James -LRB- 12,209 -RRB- is also in striking distance of Wilt -LRB- 12,681 -RRB- in all-time field goals after just passing Michael Jordan for fourth all-time . He 's got a long way to go to be the No. 1 all-time in this category ahead of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -LRB- 15,837 -RRB- , about four-and-a-half seasons if he can keep his career average of 9.9 FGs per game -LRB- which is likely to drop as time goes on -RRB- . -- Only one player , Steve Nash , has ever averaged more than 10 assists per game at age 35 or older -LRB- Nash did it three times -RRB- . If James can keep up his 10.7 league-leading average , he would become the second to do it while averaging nearly 10 points per game more than Nash did in his best scoring season over 35 . It 's a reflection of how long James has played , but the pace at which he 's approaching these milestones and blowing by them is also a reminder that he still seems very much in his prime . His scoring is down slightly , as is his rebounding and shooting percentage , but with the Lakers at 33-7 and his assist average higher than ever , you 're hard-pressed to say that he 's not one of the five most valuable players in the NBA right now . Even among the most storied players in NBA history to play well into their mid - and late-30s , that 's pretty much untouched air . It 's healthy to appreciate that we never might see this type of player passing these kinds of milestones for years to come . `` He 's just special . You know what I mean ? '' Frank Vogel said Friday in Dallas . `` There 's not enough adjectives , really , to describe LeBron James . He 's a guy that 's going to be setting milestones or breaking records every few games , seemingly , probably , for the rest of his career . So it 's pretty awesome .

0.0	{"docid": "0Nr8fWML", "title": "Now open to the public , the Portland Hyatt Regency Convention Center was largely union-built", "content": "Portland-area planners have been talking about a designated convention center hotel since 1990 , when the Oregon Convention Center opened . On Dec. 19 , 2019 , it finally opened for business , about two months ahead of schedule . Known as the Hyatt Regency Portland at the Oregon Convention Center , it 's 14-stories tall and has 600 rooms , every one of them with a view . It 's located directly across the street from the landmark twin glass spires of the convention center , and directly in front of the TriMet MAX Light Rail stop , and it has already booked several dozen upcoming conventions . The hotel was built and financed by Mortenson , a Minneapolis-headquartered developer that has offices in Portland and 10 other cities . But the project , estimated at $ 224 million when it began , likely would n't have penciled out without substantial public subsidy , including $ 60 million in revenue bonds that will be repaid by hotel taxes at the new hotel ; $ 10 million in economic development funds that came from Oregon Lottery revenue ; and $ 4 million from the Metro regional government 's visitor facilities reserve fund . All told , public subsidy accounted for about 30 % of the development cost , while Mortenson 's development arm put up about 70 % . Because of the public dollars , contractors on the project were required to pay the prevailing wage and benefits for each construction craft . That -- and a de facto partnership between Mortenson and the Columbia-Pacific Building Trades Council -- meant the hotel was built largely by union workers . -LSB- A notable exception was tilesetters -RSB- `` As it was going through the process of design and construction and the political process , the unions were always there as our partners and supporters , '' says Mortenson operations director Mike Clifford . `` And we reciprocated with having union contractors on the project for the majority of the scopes of work and the trades . '' Clifford also said Mortenson was extremely impressed with the commitment to safety and the quality and professionalism of the union workforce on the project . The public subsidies also came with conditions to benefit the community , including commitments to employ women and minorities as workers and contractors , and give building trades apprentices opportunities to gain experience . As tracked by Mortenson , 27.4 % of the construction work overall was done by apprentices , exceeding the project target of 20 % . Women did 7.5 % of the work , more than on most construction jobs but just half the project goal of 15 % . Workers of color did 28.1 % of the work , coming close to the project goal of 30 % . In practice , the project was a test run of Metro 's Construction Careers Pathways Project , which aims to give women and minorities greater opportunities for jobs on public construction projects . To that end , Mortenson contributed $ 300,000 and Metro contributed $ 150,000 to fund local pre-apprenticeship training programs that get job-seekers ready for careers in the building trades . As for contractors , the goal was to have 20 % of the work go to those classified as Disadvantaged , Minority-Owned , Women-Owned , or Emerging Small Businesses . That included not just construction firms but security , waste disposal , and planning . In the end , Mortenson reported that those firms accounted for 28.5 % of the $ 97,366,163 total direct construction cost . Another of the conditions of the public subsidy was that the new hotel block off 500 of the hotel 's 600 rooms for convention groups . Metro has long seen a convention center hotel as a necessary ingredient to attract bigger conventions . Without it , the Convention Center itself has been losing money every year , though convention center visitors do contribute significantly to the local economy . Finally , under a `` labor peace agreement '' signed by Hyatt and UNITE HERE Local 8 before the project began , hotel managers wo n't mount an anti-union campaign if and when the approximately 120 hotel workers seek to unionize . On opening day Dec. 19 , a day after Mortenson handed the keys over to Hyatt , Hyatt sold the hotel to Xenia Hotels and Resorts for $ 190 million , $ 317,000 per room . The fact that the sales price was less than the cost to develop the hotel seems to bolster the case that the project would n't have pencilled out financially without public subsidy . Xenia is a real estate investment trust -LRB- REIT -RRB- , a publicly traded holding company that invests in `` luxury and upper upscale hotels and resorts , '' according to its press statement . Ten Hyatt-managed hotels make up about 30 % of its holdings . A Metro spokesperson said the labor peace agreement continues in force regardless of who owns the hotel .

Blair says his relationship with them hit the rocks when he came out as gay at the age of 14 but it `` completely broke down '' when he was at university . The 21-year-old says the stress of trying to support himself led to him dropping out of his course last year . There are now calls for estranged students to be entitled to the same support as those who have experienced the care system . Blair , from Kilsyth in North Lanarkshire , told BBC Scotland 's The Nine : `` I 'm from a religious family and when I came out as gay I was told that was n't an option . `` I was told that my parents would not have a gay son so I would either be straight or not be their son . '' He says he `` remained closeted '' for the next four years while he was in school . `` I had to live a horrible double life , '' he says . When he went to study law at Glasgow University he wanted to sever all ties with his family but discovered their income was taken into account when assessing his student loan , leaving him with about # 3,000 less than an independent student . He says : `` It is very difficult because the whole system is based on the assumption that your parents will help out . '' Blair says he was working in two part-time jobs but could not make ends meet . `` I was in rent arrears , I was stealing food from work , I could not afford to live really and the stress of all that combined with all of the stress of being at university meant I had to drop out in January 2019 . '' Blair was entitled to extra funding from SAAS - the Scottish Government agency which provides students with financial support but he says he found it difficult to prove he was estranged . He says the online form would not let him claim `` estrangement '' status and he had to phone up SAAS , who he says were `` completely insensitive '' . After he had dropped out , SAAS eventually recognised Blair as being estranged and he got extra funding to resume his studies . What is estrangement ? Students who are under 25 can apply for `` estrangement '' status if there is a permanent breakdown in their relationship with their parents or guardian . This means they will be exempt from their parents ' income being taken into account when working out how much funding , such as student loans , they are allowed . SAAS says all cases are assessed individually but it would expect there to have been no contact for at least 12 months . The `` estrangement '' needs to be `` endorsed by a professional person who knows your circumstances '' such as social worker , college/university adviser or a teacher . People over 25 are classed as `` independent '' students . ` Corporate parent ' Aberdeenshire East MSP Gillian Martin , who was a college lecturer for 13 years , says her own experience tells her that many people are `` falling through the cracks '' . `` I reflect back on my experience as a lecturer and students would drop out and you would never know why , '' she says . `` I wonder how many of my students were in that situation where they did not have that support . '' The SNP MSP is backing a campaign by the charity Stand Alone that calls on the Scottish government to give estranged students the same rights as young people who have been in care . This would mean more access to funding and support . ` Cliff-edge moments ' Ms Martin says estranged students need a bursary to give them an opportunity to have accommodation that is not just term-time . `` They are not able to go home during the recess period and they are not able to go back to mum and dad when they graduate . These can be real cliff edge moments for estranged students , '' she says . Ms Martin also says there is an issue with who will be the `` guarantor '' for tenancies on flats rented by estranged students . She wants the same `` corporate parent '' arrangements as for care-experienced students which mean the university acts as the guarantor . The Scottish government said they were committed to supporting estranged students and were `` actively considering '' the call to extend the care-experienced bursary to estranged students . They said SAAS were also making `` enhancements '' to the online application process that Blair found so difficult to navigate . Blair says : `` If there was treatment on a par with care-experienced students then more estranged students could go to university and graduate and have successful and healthier lives .

Ore-Coker walked through his two adjoining businesses Wednesday , speaking quietly through his safety mask as he described a fire that left his livelihood charred by flames , soaked with water and infused in smoke . `` I was going to bible study and they called me that there was a fire , so I knew there was nothing I could do . If I come back , I ca n't put it out , '' he said . Ore-Coker and firefighters said the fire started in the back of his African-Caribbean cafe , Mumsy 's Kitchen . Just one door connects the restaurant to his barber shop , Oremi Hair Braiders and Barbers . The cafe will take the longest to repair , but Ore-Coker will not let the disaster keep him from continuing his barber and braiding work . `` I will divert my traffic of clients to a different location as soon as possible , '' he said . Ore-Coker said customers are already calling him to set up appointments , and he hopes others will do the same . His businesses are a part of a strip mall that wraps around a large parking lot . The smoke traveled to all of them , but by Wednesday at least half were already able to open . A state inspector on scene told KSAT the row of businesses most affected will need some work done to repair smoke damage . The Labor Finders business , two businesses away from the Mumsy 's Kitchen , is one of the few still without electricity . The owner expects it to take at least five days for crews to restore power and remove smoke-damaged parts of the ceiling and wall .

On Monday , Nell Theresa Sheehan , 23 , of Shohola and Rebecca S. Moore , 31 , of Dingmans Ferry were taken into custody without incident . Both were charged with one first-degree felony count of drug delivery resulting in death , one first-degree felony count of conspiracy to commit a drug delivery resulting in death , one first-degree felony count of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance , one first-degree felony count of conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance , and one third-degree felony count of criminal use of communication facility in relation to the overdose death of Angelo Michael Genell , 30 , of Old Forge . Over the course of a six-month investigation , Pennsylvania State Police out of Troop R were able to find that Moore had sold the heroin that resulted in Genell 's death to Sheehan . On July 28 , Genell and Sheehan -- who knew Genell through her ex-boyfriend -- used that heroin and consumed alcohol as they sat in his truck alongside River Road in Milford Borough . Both Genell and Sheehan passed out , and when Sheehan awoke , she found Genell to be blue in color and unresponsive . Police said that Sheehan contacted 911 with Genell 's phone before fleeing the scene . Maintenance workers later found Sheehan 's Steve Madden bag -- containing heroin , drug paraphernalia and a bus pass -- in the vicinity of the crime scene . Police were able to connect the bus pass to Sheehan . On July 30 , the autopsy for Genell revealed that he died from mixed substance toxicity , with reports indicating that various substances related to heroin and fentanyl were found in his blood . Working with a criminal informant , police were able to find that Sheehan acquired her heroin through Moore . After setting up a controlled purchase of a bundle , or ten bags , of heroin from Moore , police were able to obtain a search warrant for Moore 's Beaver Court home . On Aug. 1 , Moore was pulled over by a Blooming Grove patrolman , who found empty heroin and fentanyl packets labeled `` Check Mate '' in Moore 's purse , along with orange prescription pills . In the trunk , the patrolman found 70 packets of suspected heroin and fentanyl labeled `` Check Mate , '' a small amount of marijuana , and $ 242 in cash , the serial numbers of which matched the money provided to the criminal informant for the purchase . Police also found an active warrant for Sheehan in Passaic County , New Jersey , where she was wanted for a possession of a controlled substance charge from May 2019 . During a search , police found empty glassine packets of suspected heroin and fentanyl labeled `` Check Mate '' and `` Audi '' in her bra , along with another empty packet , a spoon and a hypodermic needle in her purse . Sheehan was arrested for the active warrant , in addition to possession of drug paraphernalia . That night , police found empty glassine packets labeled `` Check Mate '' and `` On Demand '' in Moore 's home . On Aug. 2 , Moore revealed to police at Blooming Grove that she had been selling heroin for a man named Rob Ciervo for several months , and that she received particular stamps -- including `` On Demand , '' `` Escobar '' and `` Check Mate '' -- from Ciervo . On Aug. 16 , Sheehan 's boyfriend related the story that she had told him about the incident on July 28 to police , explaining that she had gotten high with Genell , passed out , and woke up to find him dead . On Nov. 27 , the drug identification report from Pennsylvania State Police 's Wyoming laboratory concluded that the glassine packets from the crime scene contained a mix of heroin and fentanyl . Troop R 's Robert Urban confirmed that bail for both Sheehan and Moore has been set at $ 500,000 , and their preliminary hearings are scheduled for Jan. 22 , 2020 .", "url": "https://www.poconorecord.com/news/20200115/2-pike-county-women-charged-in-overdose-death", "kws": ["Pike^^County", "heroin", "Pennsylvania^^State^^Police", "Lackawanna^^County", "Police", "drug^^paraphernalia", "Passaic^^County", "orange^^prescription^^pills", "drug", "alcohol", "Milford^^Borough", "Rebecca^^S.^^Moore", "incident", "Dingmans^^Ferry", "man", "bail", "Beaver^^Court", "marijuana", "controlled^^substance", "criminal"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety": 0.9995978474617004}, "second_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety_Other": 0.9995978474617004}}}

Following in the footsteps of Waitrose 's ` Unpacked ' pilot scheme , shoppers will be able to fill up their own containers with products such as Asda 's own-brand coffee , rice and pasta , the supermarket said . The firm has also coordinated with well-known brands so customers will be able to use refill pots for Kellogg 's cereals , such as Coco Pops and Rice Krispies , and Unilever 's PG Tips . In addition to refill stations , the store will include a `` naked florist '' offering plastic-free flowers , and is to sell loose produce items such as cucumbers and mushrooms in a bid to cut down on plastic packaging waste . A range of new recycling facilities throughout the store will also aim to encourage customers to return used packaging including plastic bottles , cans , and hangers , the firm added . The re-vamped store is due to open in May , with the trials set to last at least three months before a decision is made on whether to roll out the approach to other stores . The initiative is Asda 's latest effort reduce the amount of plastic it uses . The firm claims to have removed 8,000 tonnes of its own brand packaging since 2018 , and has pledged to make almost a third of plastic packaging from recycled sources by the end of 2020 .

Members of a Senate transportation subcommittee voted 3-0 Wednesday to advance legislation seeking to make it a fineable offense for slower-moving motorists who fail to leave the left lane of a four-lane highway when an approaching vehicle traveling at a faster speed attempts to pass . `` This bill would just say to those people in the left lane , if you know somebody 's coming , you have to yield the way , '' said Sen. Zack Whiting , R-Spirit Lake , who managed Senate File 389 in subcommittee . `` The overall goal of it is to help the efficient flow of traffic . '' S.F. 389 requires a person operating a vehicle in the left-most land of the roadway to make a lane change to the immediate right if the person knows or should know that another vehicle will overtake the person 's vehicle . Exemptions apply to road construction workers or emergency personnel in the course of their duties ; when traffic conditions prevent a lane change ; when there is a legally established obstruction -- such as a traffic-control device -- and when exiting on the left side of the roadway . Failure to comply would result in a $ 100 scheduled fine , according to the legislation . If a violation resulted in serious injury , the penalty would be a $ 500 fine and/or a 90-day driver 's license suspension , while a resulting death would carry a $ 1,000 fine and/or a 180-day license suspension for a violation . `` This bill is addressing left-lane camping , '' said Whiting . `` The idea is that it kind of speeds up the flow of traffic . If people are in the left lane and have their cruise control set at 60 mph but the flow of traffic is going 65 , necessarily people are going to have to pass them . '' According to data included in a Legislative Services Agency fiscal note , there were 37 violations for failing to yield to a passing vehicle under current law and 25 violations for passing on the wrong side in fiscal 2019 . Citations are expected to increase by the creation of a new violation . Sen. Todd Taylor , D-Cedar Rapids , said he supports legislation addressing `` rolling roadblocks , '' saying , `` I want people to move over so we do n't have this left-lane camping thing , but we need signage and education to get the word out . '' SEAT BELT LAW EXPANSION Whiting also managed a separate measure , Senate File 2012 , which would expand Iowa 's current seat belt law to require that all passengers in both the front and back seats wear a seat belt , restraint or ride in a safety seat . Currently , the back-seat requirement only applies to passengers aged 17 and younger . Legislators were approached by medical personnel who encounter injuries caused by unbelted back-seat passengers slamming into front-seat occupants during vehicle accidents that could be prevented if all riders were wearing seat belts . `` The goal and intent of it is to keep people safe , '' Whiting said . `` I used to think about seat belts this way -- well , as a pro-liberty guy , if I 'm not wearing my seat belt , I 'm not hurting anybody but myself . `` As I 've learned sadly through this , that 's not always true , '' he said . `` If somebody in the back comes up and hits me , it 's dangerous for everybody on the road . '' A companion bill has been introduced in the Iowa House this session as well by Rep. Megan Jones , R-Sioux Rapids . `` If we have those people secured and tucked into their belts , then we have less likelihood that they 're going to fly into someone else who may be properly belted in but still faces injuries because of that flying person in the back seat , '' Jones said . `` For a lot of people , I think this is a non-issue . They just buckle in , they 're so used to it . Kids are so -LRB- accustomed -RRB- to being in car seats for so long , I think it 's just natural , it 's just a habit . '' RUMBLE STRIPS ON PAVED ROADS Another House measure dealing with a transportation issue was filed by three representatives who had fatal mishaps in their districts where collisions occurred at rural intersections . The measure , House File 2004 , would require the construction and maintenance of rumble strips for paved county roads with a 55 mph speed limit where they intersect with a major state or U.S. highway to alert drivers to the approaching stop sign . `` I think having a rumble strip , which is a completely different sensory perception than the visual of a stop sign , I think would help tremendously , '' said Rep. Dean Fisher , R-Montour , one of the bill 's sponsors . `` I do n't like mandates , but just like you 've got to have stop signs at those intersections , I think we need to have rumble strips . I think that they will save many , many lives . '' Fisher said such safety measures are now located at the discretion of state Department of Transportation officials , but he believed rumble strips could be installed by cutting grooves in the pavement a certain distance from the intersection at a relatively low cost . Sponsors believe the rumble strip additions would help address drivers who are distracted by electronic devices or sleepy as their vehicles approach sometimes busy intersections . `` If you run a stop sign at one of those intersections , you 're almost guaranteed to hit somebody , '' he said . `` On a country road , unfortunately , people do fall asleep or look at their phones . '' REMOVING 2-MILE RESTRICTION Also Wednesday , a Senate agriculture subcommittee approved legislation that would remove a two-mile limit from an originating farm for drivers under the age of 16 who are operating farm implements on rural roadways and driving to an adjacent property . `` Farms have grown and two miles is really restrictive and really does n't fit with where farms are today so we just removed the two-mile restriction on implements of husbandry to and from farms , '' said Sen. Dan Zumbach , R-Ryan , chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee .", "url": "https://qctimes.com/news/state-and-regional/iowa/bill-seeks-to-get-left-lane-campers-to-pull-over/article_d3345bbc-efd0-5284-a24e-eb1d204e458f.html", "kws": ["left-lane^^campers", "left-lane^^camping", "Bill", "legislation", "Legislators", "lawmakers", "Iowa^^lawmakers", "front-seat^^occupants", "U.S.^^highway", "vehicle^^accidents", "rural^^roadways", "Sponsors", "road^^construction^^workers", "Lake", "R-Spirit^^Lake", "emergency^^personnel", "Transportation^^officials", "mandates", "road^^construction", "slower-moving^^motorists"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 0.8412792086601257}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Municipal": 0.8412792086601257}}}

Here 's a closer look at some of the candidates to take over as manager , along with their current or former roles : Dusty Baker -LRB- former Giants , Cubs , Reds and Nationals manager -RRB- : A three-time National League Manager of the Year , Baker managed for 20 years with four teams , leading the Giants to the 2002 World Series and taking the Cubs , Reds and Nationals to the playoffs . Baker is highly respected in the game with 1,863 career wins , but his failures in the postseason have been notable . He 's known as a players ' manager , but he 's 70 years old . Jeff Banister -LRB- Pirates special assistant -RRB- : Banister , 55 , went 325-313 in five seasons as manager of the Rangers , winning two AL West titles in his first two years . The Astros wrestled control of the division away from Texas and won the AL West from 2017-19 . Banister grew up in the Houston area and attended the University of Houston . The AL Manager of the Year in 2015 , he was the Pirates ' bench coach from 2011-14 and returned to the Pittsburgh organization after he was dismissed by the Rangers following the 2018 season . Bruce Bochy -LRB- former Giants and Padres manager -RRB- : Bochy , 64 , just recently stepped down after a hugely successful 13-year run with San Francisco -LRB- 2007-19 -RRB- , where he led the Giants to World Series titles in 2010 , 2012 and 2014 . That came on the heels of 12 years as the San Diego Padres manager , which included one World Series appearance . The former Astros catcher would bring a wealth experience and knowledge to a club that will contend in the AL this year . Joe Espada -LRB- Astros bench coach -RRB- : Espada , 43 , would make a smooth transition into the managerial chair after serving as Hinch 's bench coach the last two years . Espada was a finalist for the managerial jobs with the Cubs and Giants this offseason . He came to the Astros after four years with the Yankees -LRB- 2014-17 -RRB- , serving the last three as the Yankees ' third-base coach . Prior to that , he had an eight-year stint with the Marlins -LRB- 2006-13 -RRB- , including time as third-base coach for four seasons -LRB- 2010-13 -RRB- . Ra\u00fal Iba\u00f1ez -LRB- Dodgers special assistant -RRB- : Iba\u00f1ez , 47 , spent 19 years as a player in the big leagues , mostly with the Mariners . He also played for the Royals , Phillies , Yankees and Angels . Iba\u00f1ez has been a special advisor with the Dodgers since 2016 . He was a finalist for the Rays ' managerial position in 2014 even though he had not officially retired as a player . Buck Showalter -LRB- former Yankees , D-backs , Rangers and Orioles manager -RRB- : A three-time AL Manager of the Year , Showalter , 63 , served as manager of the Yankees -LRB- 1992-95 -RRB- , D-backs -LRB- 1998-2000 -RRB- , Rangers -LRB- 2003-06 -RRB- and Orioles -LRB- 2010-18 -RRB- . He has a 1,551-1 ,517 record during his managerial career , during which he was known for taking over floundering clubs and turning them around . He guided the Yankees , D-backs and Orioles to the playoffs and managed the Yankees and D-backs the year before they won the World Series -LRB- 1996 and 2001 , respectively -RRB- . Will Venable -LRB- Cubs third-base coach -RRB- : Less than four years removed from his playing career , Venable is considered an up-and-coming managerial candidate . Venable , 37 , played basketball and baseball at Princeton before spending nine years as a player in the big leagues , including eight with the Padres . He was named special assistant to Cubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein in 2017 and served as the Cubs ' first-base coach in '18 and \u201919 before shifting to third base prior to this season .

Well , in an all-new episode of the show tonight , Jennifer will try and convince her mother to accept her brother 's sexuality . Let 's recap what 's gone down so far . Jennifer Describes Steven 's Sexuality as the ` Elephant in the Room ' With her Family During a conversation that took place on a December episode of the show , Jennifer and Steven shared memories of their childhood . Jennifer said , `` I remember , I do n't know if you were 12 or 13 when you begged for a piano . And daddy did n't believe that you were serious because you were going through phases and all of a sudden I woke up one day and you were going to music college , '' she recalled . She then explained to cameras that Steven 's career choice to be a music teacher has been hard for her parents to accept . Steven then tells his sister of childhood in musical theater , `` It 's just where I felt a connection to , '' he said . `` I did n't feel like I belonged anywhere and music and theatre allows the ` weirdos ' to feel important , so it was , you know , finding my tribe . I think being gay was a huge part of that . But I did n't discover that until I went to college . '' Jennifer explains that their mother will have to face Steven being gay head-on once he is in a relationship . Jennifer 's Mother Denies Knowing Her Son Is Gay Jennifer is open about the fact that her mother does not talk about Steven 's sexuality , but she describes it as the `` elephant in the room , '' according to OK Magazine . The outlet reports Jennifer saying in a confessional , `` You just got ta understand the mentality of my parents ' generation ... Culturally it 's a shame to have a gay child . Your reputation means so much that you do n't want anything to risk ` tainting ' it . So , my parents know he 's gay but they never speak of it . '' On the January 1 episode of the show , Gabby , 12 , tells Jennifer and her grandmother that at church , the priest was saying that while God says to love everyone , he `` does n't support gays . '' Gabby continued , `` I was like , ` Do n't the priests love my uncle ? ' Because Steve is gay . '' In the words of US Weekly , Jennifer 's mother then `` looks confused '' and asked Gabby where she heard that , and Jennifer chimes in saying she overheard a conversation during which Steven spoke of being gay . `` I did n't know that , '' Gabby 's grandmother said , in regards to her son 's sexuality . In a confessional , a frustrated Jennifer then opens up , saying , `` I knew my mother did n't like talking about Steven 's sexuality , but hearing her lying to her own granddaughter ... that really bothers me ... I grew up with my mom lying to keep up a facade and that was my normal , and that 's not what I want my kids ' normal to be . I live my life trying to be forthright and truthful with everything .

Fast forward to the Cavaliers versus Lakers game and people are calling Kim out for allegedly booing Thompson during the game while he was attempting free-throw shots . Kardashian-West immediately took to social media to dispel the narrative that she would go to a game just to boo a player , regardless of their past affiliation with family members .

The suit names government figures and agencies including Attorney General Bill Barr , the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security -LRB- DHS -RRB- . Asylum-seekers have the right to apply to stay in the U.S. unless they can go to another safe country , but the country has to give `` access to a full and fair procedure for determining a claim to asylum '' to be defined as safe . `` The Rule recklessly subverts our legal framework for accepting refugees into a machinery for casting them off into circumstances as perilous as those they fled , '' the lawsuit says .

A Corsicana native , previous cheerleader , and now coach , Aldama had , up to 2019 , brought home thirteen national championship titles to Navarro in the past two decades -- her feats are so widely recognized within the cheer community that she 's nicknamed `` The Queen . '' Part gymnastics , part dance routine , and part Cirque du Soleil , competitive cheer belongs in its own category of sports . `` They are the toughest athletes I 've ever filmed , '' Greg Whiteley , Cheer 's director , said in a recent interview . `` I do n't think that was something I would have thought would be true before I started exploring this world . '' Anyone in the cheer world is familiar with the intensity that 's required to excel in this excruciating sport , yet Cheer shows that it can be a fairly insular world -- even Corsicana residents interviewed for the documentary are unaware of Navarro 's cheer prestige . Cheer offers a corrective to that . As the Navarro team works to develop their two and a half minute routine throughout the docuseries , they flex their tumbling skills and impressive stunts , such as a pyramid formation that involves multiple cheerleaders flying through the air and landing on other members ' shoulders . But the documentary also places their falls and missteps -- as well as the injuries stemming from them -- on full display . As a viewer , it 's brutal to watch as squad members get tossed into the air , and you find yourself crossing your fingers in hopes that they 're caught . Boys groan as their backs give out while holding up teammates , girls wince from bruised ribs ; trips to the ER are n't uncommon . But the Navarro College cheerleaders are willing to endure long hours and risky routines for the chance to keep training . `` If Monica believes in me enough to put me in , then I should be able to trust myself , '' Morgan Simianer , a flyer , says in Cheer . `` I 'd do anything for that woman . '' Throughout its six episodes , Cheer follows five main characters -LRB- Simianer included -RRB- and the struggles they face amidst training . The stories include that of Gabi Butler , a `` cheerfluencer '' who 's gained an impressive following on social media and faces an overwhelming pressure from herself , her parents , and the cheer community to be perfect ; Simianer , who was abandoned by her parents as a teenager and who was left to live with her brother in a trailer ; and La'Darius Marshall , an openly gay male cheerleader who felt rejected by his family in Florida . Each squad member sees Aldama as their champion , sometimes even as a second mother . Although they are bound by cheerleading , their ties typically extend outside of the sport , too -- for instance , after one squad member has old nude photos of her leaked by someone she fought with in the past , Aldama helps her go to the police and report it . While Aldama seems to have their best interests at heart , she 's also tough about disciplining her cheerleaders on the mat and off . Students have a team tutor , and Aldama enforces punishments in practice for tardies and absences in classes outside of cheer . Whenever someone is n't caught or a move is n't completed , Aldama makes the entire team do push-ups . And in one instance , Aldama chastises a cheerleader who gets injured while competing outside of Navarro -LRB- some cheerleaders take on extra cheerleading outside of their extracurricular at school -RRB- by making him run through a routine while limping -- and toward the end of it , he 's on his knees crying from the pain . While a regimen is certainly needed to groom national champions , her methods are sometimes questionable . At its core , Cheer homes in on the idea of trust , as much as the trust that squad members have in each other , in themselves , and what it takes to develop it . While dealing with their own personal traumas , the characters tackle both the physical extremities and emotional barriers of the sport -- which , in turn , is a critical part of cheerleading . If one person is off either physically or mentally , it could affect the whole team or send a pyramid tumbling down . Although the characters ' challenges are personal , they 're often solved with the help of their teammates : one character , Lexi Brumback , comes off as a loner in the beginning of the series -LRB- when she 's instead trying to avoid drama , because of her past of getting into violent fights -RRB- . As she begins to open up to her teammates , and sees that they accept her , she gains confidence in herself as both an athlete and a young woman . Instead of capitalizing on tired cheerleading stereotypes , Cheer presents the sport 's harsh realities , from the physical brutality involved to the fact that there 's no professional career to follow . -LRB- Unlike football , basketball , or soccer , college cheerleading is the end of the line for competitive cheer athletes . -RRB- By the time the team finally reaches Daytona , viewers find themselves not just rooting for Navarro athletes to win a national championship . They 're also cheering on people who are trying their best to lift one another up .", "url": "https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/netflix-cheer-corsicana-navarro-college/", "kws": ["documentary", "drama", "television^^shows", "competitive^^cheer^^athletes", "tired^^cheerleading^^stereotypes", "Netflix", "sports", "Cheer^^homes", "soccer", "basketball", "football", "multiple^^cheerleaders", "Dance^^Championships", "complex^^characters", "college^^cheerleading", "Part^^gymnastics", "athletes", "emotional^^barriers", "competitive^^athletes", "impressive^^stunts"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Other": 1.0000100135803223}}}

'' Agent Thompson says these altered bills can even get past those pens cashiers use to verify authenticity . `` Counterfeiters know that the pens that are used by cashiers and by merchants , '' he said . `` It 's a way they can defeat that process as well because the ink of the iodine is what reacts to the actual currency which is not really paper but it 's a type of fabric .

To receive the newsletter in your inbox , sign up here . Chris Paul can feel the heat . The NBA 's seventh-place assist man of all time is in danger of being usurped . Perhaps not this season , but maybe next . And even as he congratulated his pursuer of reaching 9,000 career assists a few weeks ago , it came with a message to fall back as well . `` Happy 35th my brother @kingjames !! '' Paul posted on Instagram with a picture of LeBron . `` And how you go back to scoring and chill with all the assists !!!! '' LeBron James and Chris Paul are close friends , of course , and even if James is able to pass him in career assists -LRB- which at current pace , he could do in 85 more games if both stick to their season averages -RRB- , it 's unlikely to affect their friendship . James said as much Wednesday morning as he talked about that milestone in particular , where he sits eighth all-time -LRB- 9,067 -RRB- behind Paul -LRB- 9,436 -RRB- after Monday 's blowout over the Cavaliers . `` If we 're able to hit a milestone throughout the course of this marathon , we acknowledge one another . We congratulate one another , '' James said . `` But it never goes to the trash talking side . It 's never been in our DNA . It 's never been who we 've been about throughout our career since our brotherhood started . It 's pretty damn cool to see CP right there , I 'm right there in assists . '' James does n't talk at length about these milestones , and his line about his legacy is that he 'll take the time to appreciate it after his career is over . But it might be appropriate to consider some of the milestones LeBron is about to hit : -- An even closer milestone : James is in striking distance of third-place Kobe Bryant -LRB- 33,643 -RRB- on the all-time scoring list . If James adheres to his season average of 25.5 points per game , he 's on pace to pass Bryant on Jan. 25 against the Philadelphia 76ers ... which will be played in Bryant 's hometown . -- In that very same game , James -LRB- 47,560 -RRB- is on pace to enter the top 10 of minutes played , where he could surpass another NBA iron man in John Stockton , who played in 82 games in 16 NBA seasons . Beyond Stockton , Wilt Chamberlain -LRB- 47,859 -RRB- and Kobe -LRB- 48,637 -RRB- are within reach this season . -- It might not happen this season , but James -LRB- 12,209 -RRB- is also in striking distance of Wilt -LRB- 12,681 -RRB- in all-time field goals after just passing Michael Jordan for fourth all-time . He 's got a long way to go to be the No. 1 all-time in this category ahead of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -LRB- 15,837 -RRB- , about four-and-a-half seasons if he can keep his career average of 9.9 FGs per game -LRB- which is likely to drop as time goes on -RRB- . -- Only one player , Steve Nash , has ever averaged more than 10 assists per game at age 35 or older -LRB- Nash did it three times -RRB- . If James can keep up his 10.7 league-leading average , he would become the second to do it while averaging nearly 10 points per game more than Nash did in his best scoring season over 35 . It 's a reflection of how long James has played , but the pace at which he 's approaching these milestones and blowing by them is also a reminder that he still seems very much in his prime . His scoring is down slightly , as is his rebounding and shooting percentage , but with the Lakers at 33-7 and his assist average higher than ever , you 're hard-pressed to say that he 's not one of the five most valuable players in the NBA right now . Even among the most storied players in NBA history to play well into their mid - and late-30s , that 's pretty much untouched air . It 's healthy to appreciate that we never might see this type of player passing these kinds of milestones for years to come . `` He 's just special . You know what I mean ? '' Frank Vogel said Friday in Dallas . `` There 's not enough adjectives , really , to describe LeBron James . He 's a guy that 's going to be setting milestones or breaking records every few games , seemingly , probably , for the rest of his career . So it 's pretty awesome .

But why did Genesis copy Lexus ' weird handwriting input system ? Let 's take a look at the center console for the new GV80 : Wow , three different rotary-style input systems . What could they all possibly do ? Well , if we zoom in , the smaller one on the lower right controls driving modes and off-road settings , the larger one on the lower left controls the transmission , and the one in the top right is actually a handwriting-recognition controller for the infotainment system . It 's that last one that I have a big problem with . To use it , you take a finger and draw out one letter at a time to spell out your input , like an address for the navigation system . Eventually , a drop down menu of autofill options saves you from misprinting the letter `` A '' for a fourth time while struggling to dodge the potholes of America 's crumbling infrastructure while writing . `` Writing . '' You know what I do n't want to do while driving ? I do n't want to write . With my hand . Only my right hand . What about left handed people ? Have you ever tried to finger-paint an address blindfolded ? Have you ever attempted it with your non-dominant -LRB- submissive ? -RRB- hand ? No ! Nobody has . It 's an extremely unnatural and uncommon method of communicating . The only people who should be good at this are note-takers , and note-takers type everything nowadays ! Of course , there are redundancies . The GV80 's 14.5-inch center display is also a touchscreen , and though the press release does n't mention it , the beautiful `` two-spoke '' steering wheel in the photos also includes a voice command button . The surfacing of the ring around the touch area also looks like it may be a rotary selection dial , as well , though I had to ask . So why did Genesis not go with something a little more conventional at this point in automotive design , like a rotary dial , directional buttons , a joystick , or just the touchscreen ? Well , we should go see why Lexus justified the technology since Genesis is just ripping that off . All the way back in , damn , 2008 , Lexus debuted its own `` Remote Touch '' trackpad interface , the first mainstream automaker to do so , only really followed by Acura ten years later , and now Genesis . Back then , Lexus ' supplier claimed its development testing proved the letter-writing controller was definitely fine , actually . From Edmunds : Denso developed a prototype called Remote Touch Interface -LRB- RTI -RRB- and then Toyota tested it with consumers . Apparently , there was no more physical or mental effort required by RTI compared to a touch screen . The RTI layout offered a screen with better visibility and it was physically more comfortable for people to operate the mouse-type controller than the screen , and the touch screen was harder to operate when the vehicle was moving . Another benefit of not relying purely on a touchscreen was being able to position the screen pretty much wherever Lexus ' designers wanted , since they did n't have to be as concerned about positioning it within easy reach of the driver . Lexus ' system also used the trackpad just like a laptop 's trackpad , letting you navigate around the screen with a cursor . This function I like . A lot of people use laptops nowadays , so a lot of people could pick this up pretty quickly . But there 's still an issue of having to take your eyes off the road to track a cursor on a screen . That 's just bad . And not a lot of people write sentences by spelling letter by letter out with their fingertip . The people that do are all under the age of 10 . I 've used Lexus ' system , at least until I forgot about it and plugged in my iPhone to use CarPlay . It 's just not the best way to write things . Back in 2010 , we actually liked the trackpad system but admitted it proved to be an issue for the passenger to use . With a little more hindsight , I 'm not sure the technology is anywhere near the best option if you have a chance to come at your design completely fresh . It 's a fair assumption that Genesis wanted the design freedom of not relying on just a touchscreen , and it 's also probably fair for product planners to think a trackpad would stand out a little more than a BMW-style rotary dial -- after all , who 's paying attention to Lexus right now ? Jalopnik reached out to Genesis for more details on its touch system and will update when we get more info . But part of the promise of Genesis is the hopefully innovative nature of starting a car company `` from scratch '' -LRB- though I 'm aware that being connected to two major global automakers does n't exactly count as `` scratch ; '' in fact that only hurts Genesis ' case here -RRB- . Writing with your finger is not innovative . The lack of consideration for the passenger and left-handed people is not innovative . Copying Lexus from 2008 is not innovative . And now Genesis has to own finger-letters until at least a mid-cycle refresh . Will it be controversial ? Only as much as Lexus ' system , which seems hit or miss among owners and reviewers . But was it the best choice ? I should probably try it first , but my hunch is no .", "url": "https://jalopnik.com/the-new-genesis-gv80-boldly-targets-uh-lexus-from-200-1841021905", "kws": ["Genesis^^copy^^Lexus", "Lexus", "Toyota", "off-road", "brand", "console", "off-road^^settings", "automotive^^design", "CarPlay", "navigation^^system", "Acura", "modes", "Remote^^Touch^^Interface", "transmission", "directional^^buttons", "autofill^^options", "Jalopnik", "note-takers^^type^^everything", "controls", "handwriting"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"TransportationVehicles": 0.6963778138160706}, "second_cat": {"TransportationVehicles_Vehicles": 0.6963778138160706}}}

Johnson , born Wayde Douglas Bowles , started his career in the 1960 's in the National Wrestling Alliance . He also appeared on Big Time Wrestling , a promotion that taped shows across California , including at KTXL in Sacramento . His career with the WWE began in 1983 , where he was one half of the World Champion Tag Team duo known as The Soul Patrol alongside Tony Atlas . The Soul Patrol were the first African-American World Tag Team Champions in WWE history . Johnson retired in 1991 and would go on to train his son , who became a pro wrestling icon as The Rock before making the transition to acting . The Soulman was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2008 . View this post on Instagram Bought my dad a Christmas gift and surprised him . He 's had a hard life . This one felt good . My dad , Rocky Johnson is a minimalist . Always has been . Never asks me for much and over the years his needs are always the barest . Crazy story , my dad 's dad died when he was 13yrs old . That Christmas , my dad 's mom had her new boyfriend over for Christmas dinner . Her boyfriend got drunk and pissed on the turkey . My dad went outside , got a shovel , drew a line in the snow and said if you cross that line I 'll kill you . The drunk crossed it and my dad laid him out cold as a block of ice . Cops were called . They told my dad 's mom that when her boyfriend regains consciousness , he 's gon na kill your son so one of them has got to go . In front of the entire family , my dad 's mom looked at him and said get out . He was 13yrs old and now homeless . That f*cked up true story happened in Amherst , Nova Scotia , Canada in 1954 . He needed the bare minimum then , just like does now . Over the years , I 've moved him into a big home , got him trucks to drive - which he 'll literally drive into the ground until I get him something else . Hell , I 'll get him anything he wants , but the SOB just wo n't ask ;-RRB- . Every Christmas , I always think about that story and my dad having every odd stacked against him at 13 , but he fought thru it and still made something of himself . Makes me appreciate his struggle and hard work . Also , makes me appreciate the fun times he would beat my ass in the gym so bad when I was 13 and say `` If you 're gon na throw up , go outside . . and if you 're gon na cry , then go home to your mother '' . I hated it then , but I embrace it now . Made a man outta me . Without pissing on my turkey . .

The van 's door slid open and passengers climbed out : seven Buddhist monks from China . Andrew Edwards , a mill superintendent from the nearby town of Lincoln , led them to a room where he had stockpiled the things they had requested for the ceremony : oranges , limes , apples and seven shovels , one for each monk . Snow lay deep on the ground , 2 feet of gritty , frozen crust , and he remembers worrying a little about the visitors . `` They were in their , I do n't know what they 're called , their Tibetan outfit , '' he said . `` With the sandals and whatnot . '' He stepped back and watched as the monks wandered from the boiler houses to the limekiln to the pulp mill , chanting , burning candles and gently tapping a gong . Edwards had grown up beside a now-defunct mill , and seen the human chaos that resulted from failures and bankruptcies -- the foreclosures , the layoffs , the departures of young families . So he had every reason to be curious about the new boss . Zhang Yin , known in China as the `` Queen of Trash , '' had built an empire , Nine Dragons Paper , by producing corrugated board out of recycling scrap . She was different from the American owners who preceded her , and not only because she could afford to spend lavishly on feng shui . The most startling thing about Zhang was her promise that Nine Dragons would operate the mill for 100 years , long enough to employ Edwards ' children and grandchildren . `` People do n't go back and redo these mills , they just do n't , '' Edwards said . `` Mills get torn down or scrapped out . And here 's Old Town in the middle of it , coming back to life . '' The year 2019 was , by any measure , a disastrous one for the relations between America and China . President Donald Trump steered the United States into a trade war , bringing average tariffs on Chinese goods to 21.3 percent , up from 3.1 percent when he came into office . Americans ' opinions of China turned sharply negative , sliding to the lowest point since the Pew Research Center began recording them . But a different story was unfolding in this battered New England mill town , population 7,500 . The Chinese government had cut off the import of American recycling , jeopardizing the supply lines that fed Nine Dragons ' broader business . To keep its paper plants humming , Nine Dragons needed this mill . And the Old Town mill , cast aside by a parade of short-term investors , abandoned to the elements , needed a savior . No amount of trade-war bluster would change either of these things . Along with gratitude came a tinge of apprehension , a sense that unpredictable change had come to the north woods . `` You want my honest opinion ? This country is being recolonized by Asia , '' said Katie Bosse , 77 . She had grown up , as she put it , `` under the stack , '' the daughter and granddaughter of millworkers , and had a Mainer 's suspicion of outsiders . `` Most people who do this do it out of greed , '' she said . But she had spotted the site manager for Nine Dragons lingering at the back of the crowd and wanted to catch him . Because this was also true : Finally , after so many years , there was opportunity to be grasped in Old Town . She dashed back to see if she could snag a job for her brother . A struggling town David Mahan , president of Old Town 's City Council , was in his truck , collecting empty bottles for his bottle redemption business , when he heard there was a buyer . One owner after another had given up on the 130-year-old pulp mill , which had contributed about $ 500,000 annually to the city 's tax revenue , said Bill Mayo , Old Town 's city manager . It shut its doors for good in 2015 . The mill sat empty for three winters , and holes opened in the roof . Animals sought shelter there . Most people in town expected it to be sold for scrap . The city 's spirit flagged , as the crime blotter documented drug busts and methamphetamine labs . The City Council , struggling to fund services from a dwindling tax base , agreed to cut 20 municipal jobs . Mahan had even talked about phasing out trash collection , a service that costs the city around $ 330,000 annually . `` I think we hit rock bottom at a certain point , '' Mahan said . Then came a call about the mill . `` You need to come back right now , '' the liquidator told Mahan . Once he had parked and taken a seat in a conference room at the mill , he dialed into a call with someone he had never met : Brian Boland , vice president of government affairs at ND Paper , which already owned one pulp and paper mill in Rumford , 125 miles to the west . Mahan was stunned . `` I 'm going , ` ND Paper , are you kidding me ? ''' he said . `` Then Brian says , ` Yes , ND Paper , we 're affiliated with Nine Dragons . ' I went , ` Whoa , OK . ' Once I heard that name , I was like , ` OK . We 're in a very good place right now . ''' If demand for pulp had wavered in the United States , it was building in China . Nine Dragons is Asia 's largest producer of containerboard , which is used to make cardboard boxes and packing material . Its founder , Zhang , amassed her vast fortune by exporting recycling scrap from the United States , and then breaking it down to pulp that could be made into boxes . That business model was shaken in 2018 when the Chinese government sharply limited the import of American recycling scrap , in a policy known as the `` National Sword . '' Paper manufacturers began searching for new sources of virgin pulp , which can be exported under lower tariffs and mixed with lower-grade fibers from Chinese scrap to strengthen cardboard . And that decision had sent ripples all the way to Old Town , where Nine Dragons announced an initial investment of $ 45 million . Mahan watched as the mill became a hive of activity . Four hundred and fifty contractors began showing up daily at the mill , and a pizza shop opened on Main Street . When the company began interviewing candidates for 130 jobs , 1,200 people applied . ND Paper , the company 's United States affiliate , seemed to bend over backward to win the goodwill of the community . It sponsored Little League teams , underwrote the Memorial Day and Riverfest parades , bought canoes from the town 's other large employer , Old Town Canoe , to give out as raffle prizes . `` We were short that money , but now , this year , it 's almost like being dropped from heaven , '' Mahan said . A dazzling party Anyone worried that Nine Dragons was another short-term owner found it reassuring to watch its investment in landscaping . The company had flown its feng shui consultant , known within the company as `` Feng Shui Eddie , '' from Hong Kong to look over the mill complex . There were problems . The mill property was abutted by a cemetery , a slope covered with gravestones of 19th-century millworkers . This was inauspicious , Feng Shui Eddie advised , because it allowed restless spirits to peer into the factory grounds . He ordered a high , 2,000-foot fence erected along the perimeter of the cemetery . Behind it , the mill staff planted a row of 230 saplings -- peach trees , specially selected for their ability to withstand a Maine winter . `` It was like belt and suspenders , '' said Craig Kerschner , the mill manager . `` The peach trees are another added layer to keep them over there , to keep the spirits in their own space . '' He added , `` It 's all about keeping them on their side . '' If these alterations prompted amused chatter in town , the mill employees took them seriously . `` It 's something they strongly believe in , and we support them 110 % , '' said Randy Chicoine , ND Paper 's general manager for Maine operations . `` Our folks are very understanding of it . '' At 2 p.m. on a sunny afternoon in August , Zhang -- known reverently within the company as `` Chairlady '' -- walked into the Old Town mill for its grand opening . She was small and twinkly , wearing a knitted Chanel-style suit woven with gold thread and patent-leather shoes with gold details ; inside her collar was tucked a strand of marble-size gemstones . She was followed by a retinue of family members , many of whom work for her . Zhang 's father , a military officer , was branded a `` counterrevolutionary '' and imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution . They were poor , and she had to go to work at a young age , to support her seven younger siblings . In 2006 , the year Nine Dragons went public , she was ranked the richest person in China by the Hurun Report . `` My sister hates lazy people the most . She is always energetic and more diligent than any other person I know , '' one of her sisters , Zhang Xiubo , told China 's state-run press agency . `` We obey her unconditionally . '' Inside the warehouse , the company had erected a white tent , fitted with decorative light fixtures and humming air-conditioners . A row of Maine 's most prominent politicians was seated on the dais , beside Zhang , and the first rows of folding chairs were occupied by dark-suited Chinese executives . On screens near the stage , time-lapse drone footage sped through months of restoration work . Zhang got to her feet , her face barely visible over the lectern . `` In China , we have a common saying : ` Separated as we are , thousands of miles apart , we come together by predestination , ''' she said in Mandarin , as her son translated . Mayo presented five keys to the city -- to Zhang , her husband , son , brother and nephew -- and the politicians stood to celebrate the mill 's reopening . `` The paper industry in Maine is coming back , '' Sen. Angus King announced . `` Why is this important to Maine ? Because trees are what we 've got . '' After that , millworkers got up , one after another , to pay tribute to Zhang . A mill shutdown `` leaves an awful hole in you that does n't go away for quite some time , '' said Michelle Fisher , a logistics supervisor , who had lived through six . Then she turned her face to Zhang , whom she called `` our Chairlady . '' `` I do n't think we will ever be able to say thank you enough , '' she said . You could almost smell the longing in the room : Please , let it work this time . An edge of mistrust Not everyone in Old Town was part of the celebration . The northern part of Maine is Trump country , rural and deeply scarred by the collapse of manufacturing . Derek King , a real estate developer , was drawn to Trump because of his tough line on China . He said he had watched joint ventures form in the region and that they were not always fair , with Chinese investors pressuring American partners to share technology . `` I think they 're ripping us off , and I think they know it , and it bothers me , '' King said . It did not sit well with King , the way Old Town 's leaders were handing keys to the city to a Chinese tycoon . But King owns a residential property directly across Route 2 from the mill , and , in its revival , he sees a market for new housing units . `` I feel a little hypocritical at times for being excited that they 're here , '' he said . `` At times I almost feel like the community , the state , is prostituting itself to get 130 good jobs in here . '' Duane Lugdon was not part of the celebration , either . Now 65 , he had served for 22 years as the union representative at the Old Town mill , Local 80 of the United Steelworkers . With its acquisition by ND Paper , the mill became -- for the first time in decades -- a nonunion shop . It bothered Lugdon that the mill would now be loading much of its pulp -- virgin pulp , produced from trees -- onto cargo ships headed for China , to be fabricated among Nine Dragons ' eight mills there . `` The Chinese want these paper facilities for one reason , '' Lugdon said . `` Remember , what they want is the fiber . They do n't have any . That 's the issue in China . They have to get their trees somewhere else . '' But he was careful about what he said because he , too , wants it to work . `` It sat idle for three years because nobody wanted to commit the dollars , '' he said . `` The fact that the Chinese have done it , that 's a wonderful thing . If you think of it from the perspective of being dead , it 's no longer dead . '' And with this , he said , begins a new period , of foreign ownership . `` It 's something we had n't seen in this country in 100 years , but we 're seeing it now , '' he said . ` Squeezing the life out of it ' As the new year began , the mill still bore a bright two-story banner that read `` Old Town , New Beginning . '' The mill restart had proved a struggle , as the new owners grappled with equipment that suffered from years of neglect , said Kerschner , the mill manager . He sat in front of his window , as gusts of snow spiraled outside in a bitterly cold wind . The sun sank below the horizon at midafternoon , just after 4:30 p.m. `` They were squeezing the life out of it before , '' he said . The ambitious two-year goal declared at the grand opening -- to convert the mill from hardwood to softwood , and then scale up pulp production from the mill 's former yield of 150,000 tons a year to 270,000 -- is still far off . The mill is still ramping up , producing about 200 tons a day , Kerschner said . He said he hoped to bring production up to the pre-shutdown level early this year . `` We 're right on the verge now , '' he said . `` Every day you can feel we 're right on the edge of what needs to occur . '' Old Town 's small commercial strip was desolate during the holidays , its single popular restaurant gutted by a fire . Many in town were watching the mill , to see if the new owners would be scared off , like the ones who came before . Dan Smart , 63 , who logged 39 years at the mill and then returned for a few months to work security , said that , on the contrary , the new owners seemed to have limitless patience . They assigned double crews , month after month , as technicians worked to bring the boilers back into operation . `` In the past , if something was n't running in a hurry , someone was panicking , '' he said . `` That money they have is a bottomless pit . '' He concluded , eventually , that the panic is not coming . `` That threat seems to be gone with this outfit , '' he said . `` They 're in it for the long haul . '' Cathy Cashman , now 64 , had started there when she was 22 . The mill 's history was her history . She was there when a worker killed himself by jumping off the roof , and when a couple , who both worked there , married outside the converter . At one point , she gave her co-workers instructions for some eventual day , to scatter her ashes from the roof of the recovery boiler . The new owners did not hire her back , and this made her bitter . Still , as the new year began , she fretted about the restart in a way that was almost protective . She made it a point to count the stacks , just to see where the steam was coming from , ticking them off one by one . The recovery boiler , the limekiln , boiler No. 5 , boiler No. 6 , the digester room . A few days ago she saw something she had not seen before , steam coming out of the kraft mill . And it gave her a gust of hope . `` You want it to succeed , '' she said . `` It might bring Old Town back to life .

Long Beach Lesbian and Gay Pride , the nonprofit that has thrown the annual bash for more than 30 years , debuted a new name , logo , mission statement and website on Wednesday , Jan. 15 -- the same day early bird tickets for this year 's festival became available . The organization is now known simply as Long Beach Pride , a change that President Denise Newman said was sparked by the new decade . `` The start of a decade is the perfect time to reflect on Long Beach Pride 's strong history and our commitment to inform and inspire a new generation of active members , '' Newman said in a statement . `` Our name now reflects our mission of encouraging even more inclusion and embracing the LGBTQ + community as a whole , and its allies , through the simple yet universal message of having pride in ourselves and each other . '' In addition to a flip of the calendar , the changes may also represent a new era for Long Beach Pride . The nonprofit has faced financial woes in recent years , which led organizers to ask in 2018 for a break from some city fees to relieve some of the burden on running the event . City staff , in response , noted that City Council policy prohibits officials from waiving fees outright to ensure taxpayers do n't have to foot the bill for special events . But officials offered up other ideas to lower the costs for the festival . Some of those ideas included reducing the venue size , maintaining a two-day -LRB- rather than three-day -RRB- event , using a traffic control company for street closures and only allowing alcohol in certain areas , which could cut down on staffing costs . Lawrence Cagney , an attorney with Krieger & Krieger , which represents Long Beach Pride , said Wednesday , Jan. 15 , that the organization has implemented many of those ideas . Recent filings with the state Attorney General 's office show that the nonprofit 's assets and revenues have declined every year since 2015 . But , Cagney said , some of those assets , such as real estate , may be worth more than the last valuation indicates . He also said the organization more broadly has been committed to righting its financial footing . `` I think they 're well on the road to greater stability , '' Cagney said .

Johnson , born Wayde Douglas Bowles , started his career in the 1960 's in the National Wrestling Alliance . He also appeared on Big Time Wrestling , a promotion that taped shows across California , including at KTXL in Sacramento . His career with the WWE began in 1983 , where he was one half of the World Champion Tag Team duo known as The Soul Patrol alongside Tony Atlas . The Soul Patrol were the first African-American World Tag Team Champions in WWE history . Johnson retired in 1991 and would go on to train his son , who became a pro wrestling icon as The Rock before making the transition to acting . The Soulman was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2008 . View this post on Instagram Bought my dad a Christmas gift and surprised him . He 's had a hard life . This one felt good . My dad , Rocky Johnson is a minimalist . Always has been . Never asks me for much and over the years his needs are always the barest . Crazy story , my dad 's dad died when he was 13yrs old . That Christmas , my dad 's mom had her new boyfriend over for Christmas dinner . Her boyfriend got drunk and pissed on the turkey . My dad went outside , got a shovel , drew a line in the snow and said if you cross that line I 'll kill you . The drunk crossed it and my dad laid him out cold as a block of ice . Cops were called . They told my dad 's mom that when her boyfriend regains consciousness , he 's gon na kill your son so one of them has got to go . In front of the entire family , my dad 's mom looked at him and said get out . He was 13yrs old and now homeless . That f*cked up true story happened in Amherst , Nova Scotia , Canada in 1954 . He needed the bare minimum then , just like does now . Over the years , I 've moved him into a big home , got him trucks to drive - which he 'll literally drive into the ground until I get him something else . Hell , I 'll get him anything he wants , but the SOB just wo n't ask ;-RRB- . Every Christmas , I always think about that story and my dad having every odd stacked against him at 13 , but he fought thru it and still made something of himself . Makes me appreciate his struggle and hard work . Also , makes me appreciate the fun times he would beat my ass in the gym so bad when I was 13 and say `` If you 're gon na throw up , go outside . . and if you 're gon na cry , then go home to your mother '' . I hated it then , but I embrace it now . Made a man outta me . Without pissing on my turkey . .

The borough is hoping more lighting can stop that trend . `` The borough is working very diligently to make this more of a walkable community and a safer community for both pedestrians and drivers , '' Borough Manager Jason Stains said . Stains says a lighting study showed that drivers should be seeing people from the waist up . The inverse is true in Waynesboro ; it is more likely a driver sees people from the waist down . `` We are looking at upgrading our streetlights for about one million dollars in the next two years , '' he said .

To receive the newsletter in your inbox , sign up here . Chris Paul can feel the heat . The NBA 's seventh-place assist man of all time is in danger of being usurped . Perhaps not this season , but maybe next . And even as he congratulated his pursuer of reaching 9,000 career assists a few weeks ago , it came with a message to fall back as well . `` Happy 35th my brother @kingjames !! '' Paul posted on Instagram with a picture of LeBron . `` And how you go back to scoring and chill with all the assists !!!! '' LeBron James and Chris Paul are close friends , of course , and even if James is able to pass him in career assists -LRB- which at current pace , he could do in 85 more games if both stick to their season averages -RRB- , it 's unlikely to affect their friendship . James said as much Wednesday morning as he talked about that milestone in particular , where he sits eighth all-time -LRB- 9,067 -RRB- behind Paul -LRB- 9,436 -RRB- after Monday 's blowout over the Cavaliers . `` If we 're able to hit a milestone throughout the course of this marathon , we acknowledge one another . We congratulate one another , '' James said . `` But it never goes to the trash talking side . It 's never been in our DNA . It 's never been who we 've been about throughout our career since our brotherhood started . It 's pretty damn cool to see CP right there , I 'm right there in assists . '' James does n't talk at length about these milestones , and his line about his legacy is that he 'll take the time to appreciate it after his career is over . But it might be appropriate to consider some of the milestones LeBron is about to hit : -- An even closer milestone : James is in striking distance of third-place Kobe Bryant -LRB- 33,643 -RRB- on the all-time scoring list . If James adheres to his season average of 25.5 points per game , he 's on pace to pass Bryant on Jan. 25 against the Philadelphia 76ers ... which will be played in Bryant 's hometown . -- In that very same game , James -LRB- 47,560 -RRB- is on pace to enter the top 10 of minutes played , where he could surpass another NBA iron man in John Stockton , who played in 82 games in 16 NBA seasons . Beyond Stockton , Wilt Chamberlain -LRB- 47,859 -RRB- and Kobe -LRB- 48,637 -RRB- are within reach this season . -- It might not happen this season , but James -LRB- 12,209 -RRB- is also in striking distance of Wilt -LRB- 12,681 -RRB- in all-time field goals after just passing Michael Jordan for fourth all-time . He 's got a long way to go to be the No. 1 all-time in this category ahead of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -LRB- 15,837 -RRB- , about four-and-a-half seasons if he can keep his career average of 9.9 FGs per game -LRB- which is likely to drop as time goes on -RRB- . -- Only one player , Steve Nash , has ever averaged more than 10 assists per game at age 35 or older -LRB- Nash did it three times -RRB- . If James can keep up his 10.7 league-leading average , he would become the second to do it while averaging nearly 10 points per game more than Nash did in his best scoring season over 35 . It 's a reflection of how long James has played , but the pace at which he 's approaching these milestones and blowing by them is also a reminder that he still seems very much in his prime . His scoring is down slightly , as is his rebounding and shooting percentage , but with the Lakers at 33-7 and his assist average higher than ever , you 're hard-pressed to say that he 's not one of the five most valuable players in the NBA right now . Even among the most storied players in NBA history to play well into their mid - and late-30s , that 's pretty much untouched air . It 's healthy to appreciate that we never might see this type of player passing these kinds of milestones for years to come . `` He 's just special . You know what I mean ? '' Frank Vogel said Friday in Dallas . `` There 's not enough adjectives , really , to describe LeBron James . He 's a guy that 's going to be setting milestones or breaking records every few games , seemingly , probably , for the rest of his career . So it 's pretty awesome .

It had started as a page opposed to Whitmer 's policies and `` devolved into a vile platform that promoted violence against Democrats and Muslims and churned out degrading comments about women , '' Detroit Metro Times reported last Friday . Before it disappeared after the newspaper 's report , the group had burgeoned to nearly 9,000 members that included `` elected officials , veterans , firefighters , law enforcement officers , educators , pastors , business owners , political candidates , militia members , blue-collar workers , and your garden variety trolls , '' the Metro Times said . Dozens of the posts threatened violence against Whitmer and other U.S. politicians including Rep. Rashida Tlaib , a Muslim American from Detroit . Lucido had shared more than a half dozen posts in the group since Nov. 29 , the newspaper said . He told Donahue his involvement was limited to posting videos addressing issues involved in Whitmer 's vetoes . -LSB- More U.S. News -RSB- Guitars signed by the Rolling Stones , Bruce Springsteen and other rock legends stolen from Florida storage unit '' `` That 's their crap , not mine , '' he said of the violent , racist and inflammatory comment . `` If those people are talking cowardly and inciting violence , then they should be dealt with accordingly . But do n't lump anyone in with a group of people . '' The comments to Donahue did not help . `` What his statement , his apology was basically saying -LRB- is -RRB- , ` I 'm sorry you realize I 'm a jerk , and I 'm a creep , ' '' Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich , a Democrat from Flint , told the AP . `` Leaders in this state , whether they 're men or women , they do n't act like this .

One paid to travel with his dog . They 've eaten at banquet award dinners . One expensed a $ 200 meal at a lounge . They 've attended governing and timber industry conferences around the country , staying in Jackson Hole , Sunriver , Skamania Lodge and Sun Valley . These are examples of how Douglas County commissioners spent $ 43,000 in federal money meant to help their struggling county over the past five years . The trips were underwritten by the Secure Rural Schools program , which pays jurisdictions like Douglas County that suffered financially after endangered species listings curtailed federal logging . The money was supposed to be spent on firefighting , wildfire planning and search and rescue efforts . Instead it was spent on behalf of leaders in a county so broke that it shut down all its libraries in 2017 . Much of their federally funded travel was to lobby Congress against restrictions on federal logging . Douglas County charged The Oregonian/OregonLive $ 2,000 for the records that reveal these questionable expenditures . The newsroom paid the fee . The county delivered the documents and said the request was closed , then demanded another $ 700 after a reporter asked questions about the spending detailed in them . Commissioners said their expenditures were proper and that the U.S. Forest Service , which disburses the federal money , audits the spending . The Forest Service does not perform such audits , its officials have previously said . One commissioner , Chris Boice , traveled for two nights in November 2016 to a remote outpost in Arizona to talk about forest management policy with Doyel Shamley , a natural resources consultant who 's also a far-right conspiracy theorist . A 2014 profile of Shamley in Mother Jones described him as believing `` UFO sightings are a false-flag operation by the Illuminati to accumulate more power . '' Through the county 's spokeswoman , Boice said he went to meet Shamley because of his success working with the U.S. Forest Service on managing federal lands for fire resiliency and job creation . `` He is unaware of what Mr. Shamley does by night , nor does he care what Mr. Shamley , you , or anyone else does in their spare time , '' the spokeswoman wrote . Boice upgraded his airfare on one leg of his travel to premium class and paid for upgrades to his rental car , too . He drove from Albuquerque to meet Shamley in Springerville , Arizona in a Chrysler 300S equipped with satellite radio . The spokeswoman said Boice did n't request the upgrades . `` He is an above average sized man who tries to be considerate of whomever the poor soul who has to sit next to him for several hours , may feel about him overflowing into their seat , '' the spokeswoman said . `` Therefore , he may have asked for an aisle exit row or bulkhead seat . '' Most government agencies do not permit public employees to use taxpayer money for unnecessary perks . They require workers to travel frugally in coach . Hundreds of pages of records obtained by The Oregonian/OregonLive show Douglas County 's commissioners have used the federal money to pay for expenses that have nothing to do with firefighting or wildfire planning . The 653 pages of records cover expense accounts for six county commissioners who have served since 2015 . They traveled around Oregon , the West and cross-country . Much of the expenses were for basic costs -- hotels and airfare . Other expenses drove up the cost of the trips . None has spent the federal grant money more freely than Tim Freeman , a former Republican state representative who became embroiled in scandal in 2012 after he and several other Republican lawmakers visited a topless bar during a California golfing trip . Freeman has repeatedly spent the federal funds to upgrade flights to premium class seats and once to first class . He used it to pay a $ 75 lodging fee for his dog while attending a conference at Sunriver Resort . He took a $ 66 jet boat dinner tour on the Rogue River during one conference . Tamara Howell , a county spokeswoman , responded on Freeman 's behalf . She said he flew first class to Washington , D.C. last year because he received an invitation on short notice to hear President Donald Trump deliver remarks on America 's environmental leadership at the White House . A first-class seat was the only one available , she said . Federal money upgraded Freeman 's seat to premium class and he paid the difference . `` Any minor upgrades for premium class are for aisle seats to accommodate the larger stature of the Commissioner , '' Howell wrote , `` as well as to comply with specific airline size restrictions for passengers . '' According to Alaska Airlines ' website , the $ 79 premium class seats to which Freeman repeatedly upgraded are not larger , but do come with four inches of extra legroom , priority boarding and complimentary cocktails , wine and beer . Howell said Freeman `` makes no excuses for taking his dog '' to Sunriver . `` Many people travel with companion animals , '' she wrote . The jet boat dinner tour on the Rogue River happened during a forest fire , allowing Freeman `` to directly observe fire crews and helicopters fighting that fire , '' she said . Freeman has spent the money in ways that current county policy explicitly prohibits . He spent $ 1,500 for 38 meals for which he provided no itemized receipt . Most of them were dinners . The priciest : a $ 205 evening visit in May 2018 to Brix Chill , a Roseburg lounge . The county 's expense policy , posted on its website , requires county employees to account for how they spend public money in restaurants . It also prohibits spending on alcohol . Freeman , one of three elected leaders who control the county 's budget , was reimbursed even though he did n't have itemized receipts . A county worker raised concerns about Freeman 's spending in February 2019 , asking Freeman 's assistant to be sure the commissioner provided itemized receipts for meals . But just as he had before , Freeman continued to file dinner expenses without itemizing them . Howell , the county spokeswoman , said in her statement that `` no alcohol was ever purchased using county funds . All receipts at these restaurants are for meals only . '' She said the county 's itemization policy was recent , without specifying when it took effect . The newsroom 's effort to investigate the county 's spending exposes major weaknesses in Oregon 's public records law . The county did n't provide records for more than six months . The county charged the newsroom $ 1,972 for the receipts and refused to waive the fee . The newsroom paid in November and the county released the records Dec. 30 , saying the request was closed . But after a reporter asked questions about the spending described in the documents this week , the county 's spokeswoman said the request was n't actually closed . The newsroom now owes another $ 693.77 , the county said this week . The extra fee would cover costs for the county finance director who spent 13 hours reviewing the records -- at a rate of $ 96.21 per hour . Therese Bottomly , editor of The Oregonian/OregonLive , said public bodies in Oregon too often use high fees to thwart disclosure of public records . `` The Oregonian/OregonLive chose to pay because we believe the public has a right to this information , '' Bottomly said . `` Now , they are hiking the price by having highly paid officials review the records . What if a resident of the county asked for this information ? What if she could n't afford to pay the fee ? Citizens have already paid once to create these records , through their tax dollars . They should n't have to pay a second time . '' The national Secure Rural Schools program has given $ 3 billion to Oregon counties since Sen. Ron Wyden , D-Oregon , co-authored legislation creating it in 2000 . But Douglas County has struggled to adjust to the decline in federal logging , which once helped subsidize the county 's low property tax rates . Douglas County has repeatedly drawn criticism for its spending of the federal money . Rep. Earl Blumenauer , D-Portland , said the county `` blatantly '' misspent it after the newsroom 's 2017 investigation revealed county officials awarded $ 250,000 to a nonprofit to create promotional videos meant to resurrect federal timber harvests . Blumenauer earlier this year called for a Congressional investigation into the county 's spending . Before 2008 , the money could be spent for a small number of reasons including educational after-school programs . Douglas County commissioners have previously said their spending met that description . After the newsroom 's earlier reporting , Wyden introduced legislation to prohibit counties from spending the money on lobbying . Wyden has been pushing to make the Secure Rural Schools program permanent . A Senate committee in December advanced the lobbying prohibition ; the full Senate has not yet taken it up . -- Rob Davis 503.294.7657 ; @robwdavis Subscribe to Oregonian/OregonLive newsletters and podcasts for the latest news and top stories .", "url": "https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/01/pet-travel-flight-upgrades-meeting-with-a-conspiracy-theorist-how-a-struggling-oregon-county-spent-federal-safety-net-money.html", "kws": ["county^^funds", "federal^^money", "county^^employees", "Oregon^^counties", "taxpayer^^money", "federal^^lands", "public^^money", "Alaska^^Airlines", "Douglas^^County^^commissioners", "conspiracy", "revealed^^county^^officials", "Douglas^^County", "upgrades", "money", "flights", "public^^employees", "dinner^^expenses", "premium^^airfare", "expense^^accounts", "Pet"], "text_category": {}}

The EPA has rated the top-spec model 's range at just 192 miles -- that 's less than the already modest 201 miles of the regular Turbo .

Prevention is even better . `` Cervical cancer is a cancer that starts in the cervix . It is caused by the human papilloma virus or HPV virus , '' said Dr. Georgia McCann , an associate professor of gynocologic oncology in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at UT Health San Antonio , and who also serves as a specialist in Gynecologic Oncology , Obstetrics & Gynecology within the University Health System . She says the signs are typically subtle , but sometimes are noticeable . `` Women may experience a heavier period than normal , '' McCann said . `` Sometimes they may experience bleeding between periods or bleeding after intercourse . They may also experience an abnormal discharge . '' Around the world , close to 600,000 women are diagnosed with new cases of cervical cancer every year . 13,000 of those are in the U.S. , making it the fourth-most-frequent cancer in women , resulting in roughly 4,000 deaths every year . The most common cervical cancer risk factors include women with herpes , those who smoke , having an immune system deficiency , women over the age of 40 and those who did not get an HPV vaccine . `` The HPV vaccine is recommended to be given to both boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 11 , '' McCann said . Males ca n't get the cancer , but they can still get the virus . That 's why the vaccine is so important -- even if you 've already been exposed to the virus in the past . `` The recommended ages are 9 to 11 , but there is approval for catch up vaccination up to the age of 45 , '' McCann added . Regular visits to the doctor for Pap smears are necessary too . `` See your gynecologist on a regular basis and have routine Pap smears to pick up early changes in the cervix , so we catch pre-cancerous cells before they actually become cancer so we can treat it and prevent cancer from happening .

Do you ever wonder why it seems like you just ca n't keep a relationship alive longer than 5 minutes ? Yea , I 'm all for blaming the jerk of a guy you were dating . But the truth is , it might not always be his fault ! It could be YOU ! Hard as it may be to swallow , there are clues that you are to blame for relationship difficulties and you should keep an eye out for them . It 's important to square away your own issues before you focus on your partner 's . We all have our little bad habits , but when they start to leak over into our personal lives and ruin relationships , that 's when you know it 's time to start taking action-in a good way ! Do n't despair if you fall into one of these categories . They 're all fixable ! Are you ready to discover the truth ? It may be hard , but if your relationships are worth it to you , you will want to know , right ? So keep on reading my article for 7 clues that you are to blame for relationship difficulties . 1 . You Take the Fun out of It So maybe you 're not spontaneous . Maybe you like structure and need to have things planned . That 's ok ! But you do need to remember that life does happen , and sometimes plans get upset or thrown out of whack . Try to be a little looser and a little more spontaneous when it comes to activities and things you do with your family and friends . Not everything is fun when it 's so planned out or when everything is `` against the rules . '' Do n't be the disapproving wife , girlfriend , mom or best friend ! \u2193 next \u2193 2 . You over-Rely on Technology One of the clues that you are to blame for relationship difficulties is when you rely too much on technology . Yes , Facebook , texting and online chatting are all great ways to keep in touch and stay connected . But when that 's practically the ONLY connection you have with your loved ones , it 's time to step back and get a quick reality check . Technology can never replace the satisfaction of time spent together , face-to-face . The only instance that this rule does n't pertain to is if you are apart from the loved one in question as is the case with deployed spouses , college students and family members living in separate states . \u2193 next \u2193 3 . You Live on Drama We all have that one friend who lives off of drama , the one who makes a mountain out of a mole-hill and specializes in blowing up over the smallest thing . But could it be you ? This is one of the clues that you are to blame for relationship difficulties ! Nobody likes to take the blame , but someone has to do it . And I understand that you ca n't be mellow all the time-nobody can do that ! But flipping out over little issues wo n't win you any points . Try to remain responsible and reasonable and not live off the drama ! \u2193 next \u2193 4 . You Pick Unavailable People I 'm cringing as I write this because I know we 've all fallen prey to THIS one ! Going after unavailable people is the biggest clue that you might be to blame for relationship difficulties . If the person you are trying to have a relationship with-be it co-worker , friend , boyfriend or a relative-does not put forth their share into keeping your relationship alive , then they are making themselves unavailable to you . You do n't deserve that ! Before you start diving headfirst into any sort of relationship , step back and make sure the person you are choosing is available and willing to put out as much as you do . You will be so glad you did ! \u2193 next \u2193 5 . You Work Too Much How many of you have seen The Proposal with Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds ? It 's a cute little comedy , but it carries a powerful truth : work-a-holics do n't usually get a happily ever after . If you are putting work as the number one priority in your life , then you can be sure all of your relationships will suffer because of it . Yes , we all have hectic weeks with overtime or big promotions coming up that we have to work our butts off for . But when it becomes your LIFE , that 's when you know something is not right . And the same applies for school or anything else you have in your life that might take predominance . This little clue that you are to blame for relationship difficulties is a hard truth to swallow , but you can take it or leave it ! \u2193 next \u2193 6 . You Do n't Make Yourself Emotionally Accessible One thing that I think really harms people , women in particular , when it comes to relationships is PAST relationships . Women who have had bad experiences with relationships in their past lives tend to be less trusting and a lot more emotionally guarded with future relationships . This includes any type of relationship , whether it 's with guys , friends or family members . And it can be hard to overcome ! But it is possible . You should be careful , but not so careful that you completely push everyone out of your life and away from you . Try to be a little more trusting and open , make yourself emotionally accessible ! 7 . You Place More Value on Material Items I 'm the kind of girl that does n't need wealth and riches to be happy . Yes , they are nice and having money to do things is great ! But when it comes down to the wire , i 'd rather have my husband , my family and my super friends over a bank account any day ! At the end of the day , your money ca n't make you smile , hold you close , or lavish love on you . Nor can it remind you that the simple things in life are the best . So make sure that you do n't place more value on material possessions or money in the bank then you do on your relationships . That will hurt you far more than help you ! There are lots of clues that you are to blame for relationship difficulties . In the end , finding a place to belong , somebody to love you and friends for life is not just about how much money you make or what you have to offer . It 's about making mistakes , recognizing them , and growing from them . If you can do that , it proves you are human . Just do n't make the same mistakes twice ! These clues that you are to blame for relationship difficulties will help get you pointed in the right direction . What are some other clues that you are to blame for relationship difficulties ? Do n't be afraid to share !

His set resonated with the audience , poking fun at human nature and encouraging positivity . Eisenberg , 56 , is the author of the self-published book , `` Letting Go Is All We Have To Hold Onto : Humor For Humans . '' The book consists of 750 jokes which he calls `` Eisenberg Principles . '' His set included several of these principles , like , `` My big plan for the future is to let go of the past , '' in addition to two poetry readings and two group-singing sessions of songs he wrote . This performance was the first of Eisenberg 's adapted script intended for audiences over 65 . `` He 's just brought us some sanity this year , '' said Frasier resident Roma Ritenour . `` He 's the perfect anecdote for the times we live in . '' Some of the targeted jokes included , `` If there 's a will there 's a way , and if there 's no will , everything goes to the state '' and `` life may be terribly hard and extremely lonely , but at least we 're all living longer these days . '' Both jokes provoked a burst of laughter from the audience . Much of Eisenburg 's hour-long set centered around the `` absurdity '' of human nature . `` It sucks to be human , '' he said . `` You need five good experiences for every negative one just to break even . '' Dorothy Rupert , a four-year resident at Frasier , described the act as `` honest . '' `` I could respond to his heart , '' Rupert said . `` I walked away with a line or two that I 'm sure will come back to me . ... We 're learning from each other always and that , to me , is what makes life so wonderful . '' By the end of Eisenberg 's set , all of the copies of his poetry book and most of the copies of his comedy book had sold out . Eisenberg believed the success of his routine relied on meeting the audience at their level . `` Smart people want smart humor and there 's not enough of it , '' said Eisenberg , who lives in Louisville . The group singing sessions of lyrics like `` everything 's gon na work itself out '' and commentary on how people are happiest in their senior years inspired positivity among the audience . `` It was a wonderful feeling here , '' said Frasier resident Kevin Bunnell . `` I think he 's a varied talent . '' Eisenberg said that spreading this kind of positivity is essential . `` Ten thousand people in the U.S. turn 75 every day , '' Eisenberg said . `` They 're gon na need a lot of songs and humor . '' Eisenberg plans to return to Frasier again , hoping to lead a song circle next time . He currently has two shows scheduled at the Balfour Retirement Community February and one at the Carillon in April .

The tournament saw teams from seven communities -- Fort St. John , Vanderhoof , Prince George , Prince Rupert , Williams Lake , Terrace and the home team from Quesnel -- battle it out on the ice over the weekend . While the weather was bitterly cold and stormy outside , the competition inside the West Fraser Centre was red hot . The Thunder made the game look easy , as they dominated their competition on their way to the finals , easily defeating the teams from Fort St. John , Prince Rupert , Terrace and Vanderhoof . The Thunder would face the Prince George Cougars in the gold-medal match , a team that would prove to be a challenge for the talented home team . The Thunder would score early in the first , leading many in the crowd to believe this would be another landslide victory for the home squad . The Cougars , however , had no intention of backing down , as they pushed the pace for the remainder of the first period . The Thunder would come out in the second half of the game more determined and looking like the team that had got themselves to the final . They controlled the ice with accurate passing , incredible position play and fantastic goaltending that had the crowd on their feet . `` Our goalies stood on their heads all weekend , '' said Quesnel Thunder team manager Mike Ernst . `` Jackson -LSB- Boychuk -RSB- made a couple of incredible saves today that I 'm still not even quite sure how he did them . '' With the third period winding down and the Thunder still seemingly in control , holding a 3-2 lead victory for the home team seemed assured . However , the Cougars still had some life left in them , and with one minute to go in the game , they pounced on an opportunity , scoring and sending the game into overtime . The overtime period saw both teams have their chances to send their opponents home with a slightly less precious medal , but in the end , the hockey gods decided this game was going to be settled in a three-round shootout . Is there anything more nerve-racking as a hockey fan than to watch a gold medal game come down to a shootout ? Parents , fans and visiting teams stood in their seats and lined the boards in silent anticipation of the outcome . Prince George was the first to shoot , and they scored . Quesnel responded with a goal of its own . The Cougars would miss their second shot , leaving the door open for the Thunder , who capitalized , taking the lead in the shootout , 2-1 . With the game on the line , the Prince George shooter rang a wrist shot off the crossbar , sealing the victory for the home team . Cheers and applause filled the arena as members of the crowd felt their hearts start to beat again . After the game , Thunder head coach Mike Riley said he was proud of how his team played in the tournament . `` All tournament long , we 've been moving the puck better than we have all year , '' he said . `` In the first half , we got away from that a little bit , so at halftime , we talked about the things that worked for us early in the tournament and came out in the second half and really took it to them . I am really proud of how hard of everybody worked ; they work their butts off . All weekend long , they put team first , put the team ahead of themselves , and that 's something we 've been preaching since the beginning of the season . '' Ernst , who organized the tournament , said the successful event could n't have happened without the help of the community . `` I could n't have asked for a better tournament , '' he said . `` Big thanks to all my team parents and to everyone else who helped out this weekend to put this on .

His set resonated with the audience , poking fun at human nature and encouraging positivity . Eisenberg , 56 , is the author of the self-published book , `` Letting Go Is All We Have To Hold Onto : Humor For Humans . '' The book consists of 750 jokes which he calls `` Eisenberg Principles . '' His set included several of these principles , like , `` My big plan for the future is to let go of the past , '' in addition to two poetry readings and two group-singing sessions of songs he wrote . This performance was the first of Eisenberg 's adapted script intended for audiences over 65 . `` He 's just brought us some sanity this year , '' said Frasier resident Roma Ritenour . `` He 's the perfect anecdote for the times we live in . '' Some of the targeted jokes included , `` If there 's a will there 's a way , and if there 's no will , everything goes to the state '' and `` life may be terribly hard and extremely lonely , but at least we 're all living longer these days . '' Both jokes provoked a burst of laughter from the audience . Much of Eisenburg 's hour-long set centered around the `` absurdity '' of human nature . `` It sucks to be human , '' he said . `` You need five good experiences for every negative one just to break even . '' Dorothy Rupert , a four-year resident at Frasier , described the act as `` honest . '' `` I could respond to his heart , '' Rupert said . `` I walked away with a line or two that I 'm sure will come back to me . ... We 're learning from each other always and that , to me , is what makes life so wonderful . '' By the end of Eisenberg 's set , all of the copies of his poetry book and most of the copies of his comedy book had sold out . Eisenberg believed the success of his routine relied on meeting the audience at their level . `` Smart people want smart humor and there 's not enough of it , '' said Eisenberg , who lives in Louisville . The group singing sessions of lyrics like `` everything 's gon na work itself out '' and commentary on how people are happiest in their senior years inspired positivity among the audience . `` It was a wonderful feeling here , '' said Frasier resident Kevin Bunnell . `` I think he 's a varied talent . '' Eisenberg said that spreading this kind of positivity is essential . `` Ten thousand people in the U.S. turn 75 every day , '' Eisenberg said . `` They 're gon na need a lot of songs and humor . '' Eisenberg plans to return to Frasier again , hoping to lead a song circle next time . He currently has two shows scheduled at the Balfour Retirement Community February and one at the Carillon in April . Moving forward , Eisenberg hopes to make a coloring book out of one of his songs and perform his poetry in Spanish , though he does not speak it . `` Can I really change someone ?

A former Penn State football player is suing the Nittany Lions , saying his teammates hazed him and threatened him with a `` Sandusky '' - style sexual assault . NBC News reports that the lawsuit was field by Isiah Humphries on Monday . It names a defendants Nittany Lions head coach James Franklin , defensive tackle Damion Barber , linebacker Micah Parsons , defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos and linebacker Jesse Luketa . Humphries alleges that his teammates collectively orchestrated and carried out a campaign to haze and harass underclassmen on the Nittany Lions roster . Together , says the suit , the players wanted to make recently-admitted players their `` b * tch because this is a prison '' -LSB- sic -RSB- . Among the more specific threats Humphries says he received was an allusion to former Lions defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky , who 's serving a decades-long prison sentence for sexually molesting numerous young boys . `` I am going to Sandusky you , '' the players purportedly told Humphries . Humphries says he was forced to endure the threats , which sometimes escalated into physical abuse . Older players would restrain underclassman , forcing them to the ground and pretending to `` hump '' them . In other cases , Humphries ' teammates would place their genitals upon the faces and buttocks of underclassmen , sometimes while masturbating . ESPN notes that Penn State issued a statement Tuesday . After concluding an internal investigation , the university opted not to pursue disciplinary charges against any of the accused players . `` The university has established processes in place for responding to claims of potential misconduct . In accordance with our processes , the Office of Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response and the Office of Student Conduct carried out investigations of the plaintiff 's claims independent from Intercollegiate Athletics , '' Penn State said . `` In addition , Penn State police investigated related allegations and forwarded the results of that investigation to the Office of the Centre County District Attorney . The DA reviewed the case and decided that no charges would be pursued . '' A Penn State representative later told ESPN that it , `` based on extensive interviews , '' the university uncovered no information substantiating any of Humphries ' claims . Steven Marino , an attorney for Humphries , stressed that the investigation was triggered by an anonymous tip sent to Penn State about a year after his client transferred to another school on a football scholarship . Marino said that Humphries was not the source of the tip and decided to sue only after the investigation became public . However , NBC observes that , when Humphries left Penn State , he sent out a tweet that hinted at his having endured abuse . `` After many months of prayer and thought , I will be leaving Penn State , '' Humphries wrote . `` I 'm so thankful for the coaches and the staff for allowing me to come here all the way from Texas . I have made many friends here that I will dearly miss and it 's going to be hard to leave them . `` But in order to grow and not lose the passion that I have for football and for everything that I value , '' Humphries said , `` I unfortunate -LSB- sic -RSB- will be transferring from this place .

And it may be the best Korean restaurant in town . Out back , a Harley often sits waiting for the owners , dual chrome pipes under a bunch of black leather . The bike and the food belong to Jong and Yong Choi , Korean immigrants who arrived to Charlotte with their children in 1998 . Not long after they got here , they started a restaurant off of South Boulevard , near the Compare Foods at Arrowood Road . Back then , most people in the city were n't familiar Korean cuisine . So the Chois , along with children Byung -LRB- who goes by John -RRB- and Minae , cooked to the city 's expectations -- dishes like kung pao chicken and orange beef , or any of the other familiar titles on those paper Chinese takeout menus hiding beneath silverware drawers . They named the restaurant Choi 's Chinese Wing . They were , no doubt , cooking to the stereotype of Asian food , but they were also simply responding to market demand . Business was good . After two years in their first space , they were able to move across the parking lot to a bigger location -- an old Long John Silver 's . A few years ago , the city 's tastes started to change . International businesspeople and GIs who were returning from tours in Korea stopped in and learned about the family 's heritage . They asked for the Chois ' native Korean food . Special orders of beef bibimbap and bulgogi started flying out of the kitchen alongside the typical Chinese fare . John noticed the shift . `` They want -LRB- ed -RRB- to bring more attention to Charlotte on Korean food and culture . Since K-pop and Korean drama has been so popular , we have so many new customers find out that we have traditional Korean , '' John says . Today , the old colors are still the same -- blue roof with yellow signs -- but the menu goes all in . Dolsot bibimbap -LRB- $ 12 -RRB- sizzles inside a stone bowl ; it 's topped with a fried egg and spicy , tangy gochujang sauce . Beef bulgogi -LRB- $ 15 -RRB- arrives tender and smoking hot . And Jong and Yong make all of the Korean sides by hand . Jong and Yong are the only kitchen employees in the restaurant 's 21-year history . Jong cooks all of the Chinese dishes , from sesame chicken to shrimp chow mein . It 's still excellent ; I took some home to my pregnant wife who , before this experience , had eaten chicken and rice at the restaurant . Yong , meanwhile , handles most of the Korean side of the menu . It 's based on recipes from her own mother , passed down in her family for generations . John Choi remembers his mother 's cooking fondly from his childhood . After the family moved here and got into the restaurant business , he and his sister worked the front counter as teenagers . He graduated from Providence High School in 2003 , and a few years later , he moved out west . He spent years driving an 18-wheeler until two years ago when Minae decided she , too , wanted to try something new , away from the family business . John felt an obligation to return . `` -LRB- To -RRB- help my family out , '' he says . In October 2018 , not long after John returned , the family decided to wield a name that better reflects their business and their history : Choi 's Korea & Wing . A basic Korean meal consists of a grilled meat -- ` barbecued ' over coals -LRB- relax , N.C. barbecue purists ; here it 's a verb -RRB- -- rice , and noodles in broth . As a sidecar , an assortment of pickled and fermented vegetables , or banchan , is served with the dual task of both helping to bring out additional flavors in the food , and aiding in digestion . Most people are now familiar with kimchee -- typically made from cabbage that has been left to age -LRB- OK , rot -RRB- under controlled conditions with chili paste and garlic . It 's not unlike Southern chowchow , which many Appalachian grandmothers would immediately recognize . Yong and Jong Choi roll seaweed around beef bulgogi , shredded daikon , cucumber , carrot , jalape\u00f1o , and sticky sesame rice , and serve it with a sweet and spicy dipping sauce made from soy sauce and vinegar . They also have chicken wings , and for noodles , I went with pork ja jang myun -LRB- $ 12 -RRB- . The menu has a few surprises . Still on my list of things to conquer is the beef bulgogi cheesesteak -LRB- $ 13 -RRB- . Another section reveals more unexpected offerings like gyros and fried fish -- dredged in traditional cornstarch rather than Calabash-style cornmeal . Not much has changed to the interior in the two decades they 've been there . You wo n't see cast nets or cartoon fishermen from he old Long John Silver 's anymore , but what you will see is the shell of a building that , if you 're anything like me , reminds you of childhood and parents ' reckless decisions with your cholesterol . The dining room 's first major improvement in years -- new tables and chairs -- were installed this month . As for expectations , the Chois are not your typical American family -- and not your typical Korean one either . When the weather is nice and the restaurant is closed , Jong and Yong pack up their 2011 Harley-Davidson HD Ultra Classic for a long ride on the Blue Ridge Parkway . In 2016 , the whole family took a trip down south to Daytona Beach Bike Week . But this ride is almost over . You 've got a little more than three years to visit before it 's all shut down . Jong and Yong started to tell family recently that they had a retirement date in mind . `` Summer 2023 , '' John quickly rattled off the finish line . And that 's the goal . That 's what the Chois care about -- not VIP guests , trending Instagram followers , or frankly , me writing this article . Also , John is n't interested in continuing the family business , and neither is his sister . Their parents want to retire and spend their lives as they see fit , not having to worry about conforming to what people want , but making their own path , away from expectations . In other words , they just want to get on their damn bikes , and ride .", "url": "https://www.charlotteagenda.com/192980/a-korean-family-serves-food-from-home-in-an-old-long-john-silvers-and-youll-want-to-try-it-before-its-too-late/", "kws": ["Korean^^cuisine", "familiar^^Korean^^cuisine", "Asian^^food", "John^^Silver", "Silver", "dishes", "fried^^fish", "orange^^beef", "sesame^^chicken", "home", "Dolsot^^bibimbap", "kung^^pao^^chicken", "John^^Choi", "noodles", "Korean^^immigrants", "chicken^^wings", "sticky^^sesame^^rice", "chow^^mein", "Beef^^bulgogi", "grilled^^meats"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Lifestyle": 1.000008463859558}, "second_cat": {"Lifestyle_FoodDrink": 1.000008463859558}}}

In many customs and cultures , it symbolizes an inofficial agreement to marriage that has been in fashion since the second century . Women loved to keep two rings at the time of their wedding , one to wear in their homes and the other one to wear outside in public gatherings . Nowadays , the tradition of exchanging rings has become modernized and is celebrated with big ceremonies and functions . The engagement ceremony is like a prelude to marriage , where you and your future bride begin planning for a future together . Wearing the ring shows your commitment and desire for marriage that is indeed a beautiful thing . Some people opt for custom engagement rings that are made according to the preferences and choices of the buyer . However , many prefer to buy ready-made engagement rings that come in many designs , shapes , and materials . Before we begin , we must make it clear that the concept of solitaire in the jewelry world is referred to as any jewelry that is made with a single gemstone , be it a diamond , ruby , sapphire , or any other jewel . This solitaire concept is believed by many to be a symbol of faithfulness . In this article , we will help our readers to determine the differences between different types of diamond engagement rings to find a beautiful one for your partner when the time feels right . Popular Diamond Shapes In Solitaire Engagement Rings Most people tend to follow the traditional way of getting committed and engaged by using the traditional solitaire diamond engagement ring that is both timelessly elegant and classy . Solitaire engagement rings can consist of three , four and six claws to hold the solitary jewel depending on the shape and size of it . Round Solitaire Engagement Ring This is undoubtedly the most popular shape for a diamond engagement ring as it captivates brilliance and simplicity . Also , this choice of engagement ring never goes out of style and is practical making it great for daily use . Princess-Cut Engagement Ring A princess-cut engagement ring has a square shape single diamond in it that has sophisticated cuts . This is yet another popular style and favored by those that are looking to flaunt that ring amongst friends . The sharp corners of the diamond in a princess cut solitaire ring differ from the cushion cut diamonds that have more rounded edges giving it a bolder look more eccentric look . Emerald-Cut Engagement Ring The emerald cut diamond ring usually has an elegant and shiny looking diamond or jewel crafted in a rectangular shape . It consists of different numbers of claws such as four , five or six but the diamond in the ring has a literal spin and has longer edges at the top and bottom . This style goes well on certain hands and fingers so choose wisely .

A new theory from season 2 of You suggests that Love -LRB- Victoria Pedretti -RRB- killed her husband James -LRB- Daniel Durant -RRB- and that the murder weapon may , in fact , have been a peach . After killing his former girlfriend Beck -LRB- Elizabeth Lail -RRB- , stalker/murderer Joe Goldberg -LRB- Penn Badgley -RRB- leaves New York City for Los Angeles , where he meets Love , a pastry chef whom he thinks could be his perfect match . Oh how right he is : In the final episode , Love reveals that she 's just as terrible as Joe , having killed her former nanny to `` protect '' her brother Forty -LRB- James Scully -RRB- as well as the two women who threatened to bring Joe to justice for his previous crimes . One question that some viewers were left with at the end of the season was the truth behind the death of Love 's first husband . In flashbacks , we saw that James did not want to have children with Love -- at least not right away -- specifically because he did n't want Love 's parents ' help with money or raising their kids . Shortly after , James died of a mysterious illness . Love appeared heartbroken over the loss , but now that we know Love is a psychopath who is n't exactly above murder , it 's worth wondering ... did Love kill James because he dashed her hopes of a perfect family ? Love 's black widow status has been speculated about ever since season 2 dropped on Netflix , but one theory suggests that there 's a pretty poetic way Love could have gone about murdering her former husband . Redditor Smuggertonn noted that Love , a baker , could have easily slipped something into James ' food and poisoned him slowly over time . This would track with how no one seemed to know what specifically killed James . The poison of choice , the Redditor writes , could very well be ... a peach . Rather , the pit of a peach . The pits of peaches contain cyanogenic compounds , which the human body converts to cyanide , a poison , when consumed . A ground-up peach pit -LRB- as well as the pits of cherries , apricots , and plums -RRB- could theoretically cause someone to get really sick , and if enough is consumed , even die . The theory is further explained in this video from Flicks and the City : When Love first meets Joe , she hands him a peach and asks him if it `` looks like a butt . '' Most people saw this as a wink to Peach , the woman Joe murdered back in New York , but what if it was also a hint that Love was a killer all along ? If this theory is correct , she literally handed Joe a murder weapon and asked him his thoughts on it . There are also multiple references to Love potentially poisoning Joe that make this theory plausible . When she learns about Candace -LRB- Ambyr Childers -RRB- , she bakes Joe cinnamon rolls made of salt instead of sugar . When she locks Joe in the glass cage , she bakes him muffins , and when Joe looks apprehensive , freaks out over the fact that Joe thinks she would ever poison him . Maybe her freak out was n't because Joe would think such a horrible thing of her -LRB- I mean , she did just slash two women 's throats ! -RRB- but because she wanted to make sure he never found out the truth about James . If this theory is the real deal , then peaches are truly having a moment . There 's poisoning-by-peach in Bong Joon-ho 's Parasite . There 's a NSFW scene featuring one in 2017 's Call Me By Your Name . Where is the award show love for this fruit ?! Clearly , it is capable of wearing as many faces as Love herself .", "url": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/01/9213290/you-season-2-theory-love-killed-husband-james-peach-cyanide-poison", "kws": ["Peach", "Love", "peaches", "Joe^^cinnamon^^rolls", "cherries", "plums", "Flicks", "freaks", "fruit", "muffins", "flashbacks", "leaves", "husband", "apricots", "truth", "Bong^^Joon-ho", "chef", "multiple^^references", "Shay^^Mitchell", "James^^Scully"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 0.9760119915008545}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_TV": 0.9760119915008545}, "third_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_TV_ShowsPrograms": 0.9760119915008545}}}

Martha Stevens , D-Columbia , becomes law . Stevens said it could create a more positive school environment for LGBTQ students and curb bullying against them . `` I 'm really excited to put this forward and talk to my colleagues about this , '' Stevens said Thursday by phone . The bill filed Tuesday , should it become law , would require the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to work with a statewide advocacy group to develop the curriculum to be offered to schools . The proposal has not been assigned to a committee . Stevens said she has talked with officials at the education department and other educators about the idea . `` I think it 's really important for LGBTQ students to see themselves reflected in society , '' Stevens said . Straight students also would benefit , she said . `` I think it 's important for all students when it comes to equality and different successes for students to learn about contributions of LGBTQ individuals to different parts of society , literature , art and culture , '' Stevens said . LGBTQ students more frequently suffer from depression , low self-esteem and are more likely to miss school , Stevens said in a news release . Stevens said in the interview that if the bill passes , it would be the education department 's discretion as to which statewide LGBTQ group to partner with on the curriculum but PROMO , an organization that has been advocating for the community for more than two decades , would be a good candidate . This is n't meant to take control away from local school boards , Stevens said . It requires the education department to establish a curriculum , but it would be voluntary for local school districts to adopt it . `` I would hope local school districts would see the importance of using it , '' Stevens said . Shira Berkowitz , spokeswoman for PROMO , said the organization would be willing to help the state develop the curriculum if Stevens ' bill becomes law . `` We have really strong connections with educators who can help develop the curriculum , '' Berkowitz said . The LGBTQ curriculum is needed in a state where LGBTQ individuals are n't protected , she said . `` To show these LGBTQ youth they 're valid is the most important thing , '' Berkowitz said . rmckinney@columbiatribune.com 573-815-1719", "url": "https://www.columbiatribune.com/news/20200115/stevens-seeks-lgbtq-curriculum-for-schools", "kws": ["LGBTQ^^curriculum", "LGBTQ^^students", "statewide^^LGBTQ^^group", "LGBTQ", "LGBTQ^^individuals", "educators", "schools", "students", "education^^department", "community", "Secondary^^Education", "advocacy", "Elementary", "society", "Stevens", "bisexual", "gay", "school^^offerings", "Straight^^students", "law"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 0.9242254495620728, "JobsEducation": 0.668318510055542, "Society": 1.0000066757202148}, "second_cat": {"Society_Other": 1.0000066757202148, "PoliticsGovernment_Municipal": 0.9242254495620728, "JobsEducation_Education": 0.668318510055542}, "third_cat": {"JobsEducation_Education_K12": 0.668318510055542}}}

There are bizarre demands -- from Kanye West demanding a glass enclosed mansion in Hawaii with two personal chefs to producer Mutt Lange spending the first ten days for AC/DC 's For Those About To Rock -LRB- rumoured cost for album : $ 1 million -RRB- trying to find the perfect snare drum sound . Resident loonie Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys wanted an Arabian tent built in his house -LRB- at the cost of today 's $ 220,000 where he could eat snacks and take drugs -RRB- and also a sandbox with eight tons of sand in which he placed his piano so he could `` feel the beach '' with his toes when he composed songs . Those in the superstar league can spend years making great art and paying for the experience . The Beatles spent the equivalent of today 's # 416,000 -LRB- or US$ 541 , 367 -RRB- on Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and more than covered its costs , not to mention changing pop culture in many ways . Def Leppard 's Hysteria -LRB- price tag $ 10.4 million -RRB- yielded massive hits like ` Pour Some Sugar On Me ' and ` Animal ' and sold 20 million worldwide . Also pleasing the bean counters at their record companies were Korn 's Untouchables -LRB- $ 3.9 million -RRB- , Kaye West 's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy -LRB- $ 3.25 million -RRB- and Metallica 's The Black Album -LRB- $ 1.81 million -RRB- . But there have been releases which been rock 's answer to the Titanic , which lead to record labels going bankrupt or executives getting sacked . In no special order , here are 12 expensive album flops . The Happy Mondays -- Yes Please ! -LRB- 1992 -RRB- Former Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club member Tina Weymouth who co-produced Yes Please ! remembered the sessions : `` I grew up in New York in the 1970s , and I 've seen a lot of people who live life on the edge . `` But I 've never before seen a group of people who had no idea where the edge is . '' The money spent on Happy Mondays ' fourth album tipped their record company Factory over and sent it bankrupt . Alarmed by the band 's E and smack intake , Factory head honcho Tony Wilson had packed them off to Barbados to record . One problem with that bright idea : he did n't realise it was the crack capital of the world . Before the trip the Manchester band tried to kidnap The Smiths ' guitarist Johnny Marr to work on the sessions -LRB- `` I was a Happy Monday for 25 minutes '' -RRB- . Singer Shaun Ryder , a recovering addict , took enough methadone to last for four weeks but accidentally smashed them at the airport . During the sessions when the money ran out , the band would sell furniture from the studio -LRB- owned by reggae star Eddy Grant -RRB- for crack -- rumoured to be 30 rocks a day . Band member Bez broke his arm overturning a hired car . When the album was `` finished '' with an electro-synth approach which was totally different to their Madchester sound , Ryder withheld the master tapes from Factory until he was paid # 50 . Wilson then discovered no vocals had been recorded as Ryder had not written any lyrics , so more money had to be invested . To this day , in the chaos during and after the sessions , no one knows how much the record cost , but it would have been in the hundreds and thousands of pounds . Melody Maker reviewed Yes Please ! with just two words : `` No Thanks ! '' The album scraped into the Top 30 and yielded no hits . According to label mate New Order 's Peter Hook , Yes Please ! only sold 1,000 copies . Two months after its UK release , Factory went belly-up . A now cleaned up Ryder remembers the sessions as `` a crack nightmare '' ... '' dirty , horrible . '' Michael Jackson -- Invincible -LRB- 2001 -RRB- Michael Jackson 's sixth solo album through Epic/Sony -- also his final one -- certainly did the business . Ten million sales around the world , # 1 in 12 countries , including Australia where it was certified double Platinum . But this was wheesh meat compared to his previous achievements . According to the Telegraph , Thriller has done 109 million worldwide , Dangerous 32 million , Bad 30 million , Off The Wall 20 million and HIStory 20 million -LRB- counted as 40 million units as it 's a double album . In fact Invincible looked like it would be joining those powerhouses . It cost $ 30 million to make , with Jackson reportedly cutting between 50 to 87 songs , using different producers in ten studios . Each day he booked three studios simultaneously -LRB- a very expensive exercise -RRB- because he did n't know which one he 'd feel like using until he woke that day . Sony did n't mind the huge budget : after all it planned to spend $ 25 million in marketing , to boost the sales figures . Alas , the superstar and the company got into a squabble over who actually owned the early Jackson albums . Jackson refused to tour , Sony responded by pulling its advertising dollars , and the album failed to cover its costs . Lady Gaga -- ARTPOP -LRB- 2013 -RRB- Lady Gaga 's first two albums were massive sellers as she deftly combined songwriting suss and esoteric theatrics . Seven years later , the critics are still divided as to whether ARTPOP was brilliant but misunderstood or just had a bizarre pretentious soft centre which her public was not impressed with . But the panic button was pressed in its first week of release in the US , when only 260,000 fans gave it a home . This was a 75 % drop from the last album , which shifted 1.1 million units first week . ` Applause ' , the first single , went Top 5 but badly failed to hit top spot . Interscope Records lost $ 25 million in marketing costs , and Examiner.com reckoned it caused staff layoffs at the company as a result . Gaga had the last laugh . She moved to acting and jazz duets , and impressed with her performance in A Star Is Born . The Darkness : One Way Ticket to Hell ... And Back -LRB- 2005 -RRB- After the runaway success of their debut album Permission To Land , The Darkness wanted to make an epic big-sound record . Not surprising that when the British rock band met Queen 's epic-loving producer Roy Baker Thomas backstage at a show , sparks flew and a bromance developed . `` We were going for a huge , huge production sound , '' Baker said , which meant trying out expensive techniques . The spent a full year in the studio -LRB- at one point booking two studios -RRB- , cutting 37 songs with nearly 10,000 separate tracks . Some of the tracks on the final cut had 120 layers of guitar , with Dan Hawkins using 50 different guitars . Some tracks had 160 vocal tracks , one time putting the mic in a champagne bucket to get a hollow sound . They installed the stage they used on the road in the studio . For drum sounds , they 'd try things like hanging up the bass drum halfway between the floor and ceiling or putting a kit out in the parking lot . When one of the tracks needed a pan flute , it was decided that as a pan flute is not in the tempered scale , a new one had to be created in Peru from a number of them . Not surprisingly , the budget clanged up to # 1.3 million or $ 2.46 million in Australian currency . It got mixed reviews , with Planet Sound noting its masculine themes and calling it the `` world 's most expensive penis joke . '' One Way Ticket to Hell ... And Back went up to # 11 on the UK charts , but it most likely did n't recoup costs and the band split up not too long after . James Freud -- Step Into The Heat -LRB- 1989 -RRB- After leaving The Models to become a solo act again , Mushroom Records sent James Freud off for the best part of a year , and hired the expensive services of Chic co-founder Bernard Edwards . Freud would later admit in his 2002 autobiography I Am The Voice Left From Drinking that his songs for the record were below par . As Edwards and he continued to work at the Powerstation studio to try and derail the impending monorail wreck , costs jacked up . Freud told this writer that he took to ducking phone calls from Mushroom head honcho Michael Gudinski in Melbourne to avoid telling him that costs had -- with music videos -- climbed to $ 750,000 . The album was a flop , and only one of its three singles made the charts . If that was n't enough to dent his confidence , an argument with Countdown identity `` Molly '' Meldrum at a party went on to shatter it . Freud had appeared on Countdown Revolution , the short lived `` younger '' version of Countdown , and expressed a criticism of the show 's format . Meldrum and his cowboy hat hit the roof . `` You 're nothing but a fucking has-been . Look around you . See the new hosts of the show . They are the future of Australian music . `` You 're on your way out now ! '' The argument took place on Freud 's 30th birthday , and he admitted he thought of himself as a has-been for a long time after that . Fleetwood Mac -- Tusk -LRB- 1979 -RRB- After Fleetwood Mac 's Rumours sold 23 million at the time -LRB- now 45 million -RRB- their record company Warner Bros expected the follow up to be an even bigger baller . The whole US music industry , going through one of its lows , also had the Mac pack in its sights , hoping it would be the sort of hit-laden radio-friendly blockbuster to get `` da kids '' back into the stores . However , someone forgot to tell Mac guitarist Lindsey Buckingham who was running the show . His plan was a double album -LRB- warning alert -RRB- which would give Mac a place in the post-punk scene -LRB- double warning alert -RRB- . In other words , no Rumours 2 . He dug Talking Heads and even hunted down the Beach Boys ' legendary unreleased and experimental album Smile for further inspiration . Making of Tusk video here . The band built their own personal recording studio at Village Recorder in Los Angeles from royalties -LRB- Warner Bros refused to fund it -RRB- and set to work , brewing up 20 songs in ten months . Tusk was so much Buckingham 's baby , that parts of it even recorded in his home studio . `` He was a maniac , '' producer Ken Caillat described the guitarist 's obsessive behaviour during the sessions : `` The first day , I set the studio up as usual . `` Then he said , ` Turn every knob 180 degrees from where it is now and see what happens . ' `` He 'd tape microphones to the studio floor and get into a sort of push-up position to sing . `` Early on , he came in and he 'd freaked out in the shower and cut off all his hair with nail scissors . He was stressed . '' It cost $ 1.4 million -LRB- close to $ 5 million today 's rate -RRB- and was the most expensive album at the time . Imagine the faces of Warner Bros executives when they sat in their board room listening to the record that was to make them their Christmas bonuses , and hearing ` Tusk ' as the first single . Tusk was well produced but the songs were sketchy and experimental , with just ` Tusk ' and Stevie Nicks ' ` Sara ' considered singles . It only sold 4 million copies , and was considered a fail by the record company , foaming at the mouth . In the blame game that followed , Buckingham pointed the finger at the RKO radio chain which played the album in full -LRB- allowing fans to tape it -RRB- , and Warner Bros for pricing the 2 LP set in America at the top price of $ 16 -LRB- or $ 56.70 in today 's money . Fleetwood Mac never tried anything as adventurous again . After Tusk started sputtering they clawed back their fans to their bosoms by rushing out a live album and never strayed too far away from their classic-rock format . Guns N ' Roses -- Chinese Democracy -LRB- 2008 -RRB- It was n't supposed to end up in tears before tea-time . After all Appetite For Destruction was one of the greatest debut albums of all time and sold 28 million worldwide . Use Your Illusion I & 2 sold 5.5 million each in the US alone . So when Axl Rose declared he was making a Guns N ' Roses album `` for the 21st century , and which would take the audience with him '' and it would be ready by 1999 , Geffen Records was all smiley-faced . There were ten years of delays , and the revolving door of band members , managers , songs -LRB- 60 to 80 -RRB- , producers -LRB- 6 -RRB- and studios -LRB- 15 -RRB- saw the cost-o-meter nudging $ 13 million . Geffen offered Rose $ 1 million if he delivered the wretched thing by a certain time . It then tried to offset costs by rushing out a greatest hits set into the marketplace , only to be slammed with an `` oh no you do n't '' lawsuit from Rose in 2004 . The singer lost the case and the hits album came out . Exasperated beyond belief , Geffen pulled funding in 2005 . One estimate suggested that of the $ 250,000 a month budget the band was wasting $ 75,000 on renting gear that was n't used . Studio rental was $ 50,000 a month . Each band member was getting $ 11,000 a month , guitar technicians $ 6,000 , the chief engineer $ 14,000 , and the recording software engineer $ 25,000 . These guys basically just sat around waiting for Rose to show . The talk is that with the coming of sudden and mega-success , Rose had freaked out . He had wanted to make a perfect record but he was faced with demons , including fears there were forces working against him . Chinese Democracy is a cool record . But by the time it came out , the audience had moved on , or the Gunners ' audience had split into the Axl camp and the Slash camp . It got mixed reviews , came into the US charts at # 3 and after a year had only sold 1 million in the US and 1 million in Europe . When the original lineup reunited and toured -LRB- after which the album 's streaming jumped from 8 million streams to 24 million -RRB- you could sense the crowds thinking , `` wow , Chinese Democracy would have been so awesome if it had been made by the original guys . '' The Rolling Stones -- Their Satanic Majesties Request -LRB- 1967 -RRB- Not to put too fine a point on it , 1967 was a stinker of a year for The Rolling Stones . Drug busts , court appearances , a management split , and Keith Richards stealing actress Anita Pallenberg away from Brian Jones during a holiday in Morocco . `` We were all strung out , '' Mick Jagger would admit later . So not the best time to go into a recording studio . But The Beatles had released Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band to high praise , so the Stones figured they should be shoving themselves back in the game . Problem was , there were hardly any songs in the booty bag -- except for ` 2000 Light Years From Home ' which Jagger wrote in prison , the ballad ` She 's A Rainbow ' and the riff-laden ` Citadel ' -- and no producer to control the sessions . Jagger and Richards ran loose as producers , and sessions went on unchecked , more psychedelic noodling than anything . Bassist Bill Wyman recalled in his memoirs , `` Every day at the studio it was a lottery as to who would turn up and what -- if any -- positive contribution they would make when they did . `` Keith would arrive with anywhere up to ten people , Brian with another half-a-dozen and it was the same for Mick . `` There were assorted girlfriends and friends . I hated it ! '' After Decca Records refused the original idea of Jagger tied naked to a cross , the album cover was to be a 3D sensation where their faces would change direction if you tilted it . But new manager Allen Klein -LRB- who had somehow struck a deal where he 'd make more money than them -RRB- said it was too expensive , and shish-kebabed that idea . It would emerge in later deluxe editions . Their Satanic Majesties sold 2 million copies . Some Girls from 1978 , by comparison , moved 11 million . Jagger distanced himself from it in 1995 , saying : `` It 's not very good . It had interesting things on it , but I do n't think any of the songs are very good . `` There 's two good songs on it ... The rest of them are nonsense . '' Andrew Ridgeley : Son Of Albert -LRB- 1990 -RRB- Once Wham ! declared themselves Split City in 1986 after a final show in London before 72,000 fans , George Michael threw himself back into music . Faith alone sold 20 million , almost equalling the total 28 million sales of Wham ! over five years . So Epic/Sony naturally expected great things from Georgie 's sidekick Andrew Ridgeley . But first they had to wait until `` Animal Andy '' -LRB- as the Brit tabloids dubbed him for his partying antics in nightclubs and for being thrown out of the Live Aid after-party -RRB- moved to Monaco to make it as a racing car driver -LRB- nope ! -RRB- and then to Hollywood to become an actor -LRB- nope ! x 2 -RRB- before he made a solo album . No money was spared in promoting it , including one of the videos being shot in Australia . Son Of Albert got the most savage reviews of all , for being totally inconsequential . It flopped badly , and Ridgeley was never allowed anywhere near a studio again . `` It was disappointing and depressing to receive quite such a beating over that album , '' he whimpered . He did n't have to worry too much . It is estimated that he makes up # 10 million -LRB- A$ 18.8 million -RRB- each year from continued Wham ! royalties . Jet -- Shine On -LRB- 2006 -RRB- After Melbourne band Jet 's debut album Get Born -- capturing all that was exhilarating about the renaissance of guitar rock -- sold 4 million worldwide , the purse strings were relaxed for the follow-up . Sessions were held in Barbados , Massachusetts and Los Angeles . In an insightful interview in Songwriting Magazine , singer Nic Cester revealed that hard touring around the world exhausted and overwhelmed them . They were too busy partying to write songs . And when they did , `` It was a very difficult process , well I found it difficult , anyway . `` It was different . Our worlds had changed dramatically , obviously . But there 's a darkness over that album because our dad passed away -LRB- from a battle with cancer -RRB- just before writing began . `` It was very sudden and he was very young , not quite 50 , so that whole album is very much shaded by that . '' Sales were well down . In Australia and the US where Get Born moved , respectively 660,000 and 1.7 million , the new one did 70,000 and 137,000 . Reviews were mixed . Pitchfork gave it 0 out of 10 stars and , instead of a review , posted a video of a monkey pissing into its mouth . Garth Brooks -- Garth Brooks in ... The Life of Chris Gaines -LRB- 1999 -RRB- One of US country music 's biggest superstars , Garth Brooks , suddenly began sporting a long hair wig and affected an Aussie accent in the best ` the dingo took mah baby ' tradition . Actually Gaines was the character of a planned movie called Lamb about the problems that a rock singer faced with success . Fans were confused , it sold just two million in the US -LRB- way down compared to his country efforts which did between 6 million and 7 million each -RRB- and irritated stores started discounting it within weeks . The head of Brooks ' record company was sacked for approving the $ 5 million budget . Steely Dan -- Gaucho -LRB- 1980 -RRB- There 's good perfection and umm , bad perfection . No less than 42 musicians were used on Gaucho by Steely Dan 's Walter Becker and Donald Fagen . They complained they had to repeat the same riff from noon to 6 pm . The drums on the title track were assembled from 46 different takes . Despite working with some of the best session drummers in the business , the picky pair decided to get engineer Roger Nichols to build a drum machine . It cost $ 150,000 and six weeks to make . They later gave ` Wendel ' , as it was christened , its own Platinum record award . Dire Straits ' Mark Knopfler was brought in and recorded for a few hours , and only had 40 seconds of his guitaring used . The final mix to the 50-second fade out of ` Babylon Sisters ' was completed on the 55th attempt . Three quarters of ` The Final Arrangement ' was accidentally erased by the engineer . They tried to recreate it but finally abandoned it . Costs built up to $ 1 million or $ 3.2 million in today 's money . That did n't include the $ 1 million they paid jazz composer Keith Jarrett to quieten down after he grumbled that the track ` Gaucho ' was too close to his ` Long As You Know You 're Living Yours ' . The 37-minute Gaucho did n't take two years to make just because of perfection and obsession . Before sessions began in New York , some lunatic ran over Becker one night , breaking his leg and putting him in hospital for six months . Some of his contributions to the record were literally telephoned in . His girlfriend died of a drug overdose in their apartment , and her family unsuccessfully tried to sue him for introducing her to drugs . Becker had his own drug issues , which did n't add to the problems . `` It was n't fun at all , really , '' they said later of the album 's making .

'' She continued , `` I literally worked for him . He was ordering me a car , and he told me to come upstairs and pick up a demo . I thought I would be in his apartment for five total minutes . That 's it . And he showed up naked , wearing a condom and tackled me to his bed , while I screamed and fought and said , ` No , ' and cried . That 's rape .

And I attempted suicide . He knew , '' Abrams said . `` And I told him why , that he had ruined my life , and that I had nothing . '' Jones claims Simmons raped her on their first date in 1991 . `` This was a very swift attack , and what was going through my mind more than anything was , ` Why ? ' Because I liked Russell . And I , you know , I would 've just kissed him . I would 've made out with him . I would 've -- he did n't have to attack me , '' she said . `` He raped me right up against the fucking wall . Excuse my language . But he -- that 's what he did . I had to keep this secret . '' Simmons has denied all rape allegations .

The budget , which had received a number of cuts , represents a 1.33 percent increase over fiscal 2020 , with the biggest changes in operations , with a decrease of $ 249,281 , and in salaries , with an increase of $ 236,455 . Benefits and assessments are also expected to see increases of $ 130,484 and $ 123,559 , respectively , according to the budget document . Voters must approve the budget before it becomes final . `` I think it 's come a long way , '' board member Dick Frantz said after an about-45 minute presentation on the changes . `` I think we need to get on it and get it out there . '' `` I do n't think we have any other changes we can do to it , '' added Tony D'Onofrio , vice chairman of the board . Southwest Vermont Supervisory Union Superintendent Jim Culkeen said further changes would mean the board would be looking at cutting personnel . `` We 're not doing that , no , '' D'Onofrio replied . Board members Cindy Brownell and Susan Hoag were absent . The budget would result in an increase to the estimated homestead tax rate in Bennington , Pownal , Shaftsbury and Woodford.The estimated increase would be 8.49 cents in Bennington , 11.12 cents in Pownal , 7.29 cents in Shaftsbury and 12.59 cents in Woodford per $ 100 of property value , according to a budget document . This represents an estimated increase of $ 169.72 for a home valued at $ 200,000 in Bennington , along with an increase of $ 222.49 in Pownal , $ 145.78 in Shaftsbury and $ 251.76 in Woodford for a home of the same value . The estimated homestead tax rates incorporate the homestead property yield , which is set at the state level and subject to change . At the meeting Tuesday , SVSU Director of Finance and Operations Renee Gordon summarized the changes in the budget from Draft 1 and 2 for the board , including the removal of requested positions and vacant positions , with the exception of one additional kindergarten teacher . Culkeen clarified that removals of positions that were budgeted at various schools but were not filled are cuts that are not resulting in layoffs . `` They 're sitting there empty , but on a line item , so we cut those , '' he said . Probably close to $ 240,000 had been budgeted for vacant positions that had not been filled , Gordon said . Board member Chaila Sekora asked how long the positions went unfilled . At least two years , Gordon replied . There were also a series of requests for increased funding for building-based planning this year , she said . `` Anything that was an ` ask ' for this year we essentially , for the most part , have pulled out , '' she said . Requested additional/supplemental funding for field trips -- mainly Nature 's Classroom -- has also been removed , she said . `` Again , an add , '' she said . `` We have n't removed anything that was previously budgeted . This was an increase to the existing funding . '' Planned projects have also been reduced to include only safety and building occupancy concerns -- table and septic needs , namely , she said . The budget the board passed also suspends reserve account contributions for fiscal 2021 , she said . `` So that was $ 130,000 that we 've pulled out , '' she said . Some schools also requested funding for additional transportation for summer programming . `` Again since that was an add , it 's not something we currently provide , we removed that , and that was about $ 23,000 , '' Gordon said . Sixty thousand dollars has also been removed that would have gone to a replacement truck and sander , she said . At the last meeting , four new paraprofessionals were previously requested , but only one new one is allotted under this budget , she said . She said the district must go back to the SVSU board and request permission to reduce those positions . `` I ca n't see where the SU board will not agree with the reduction , '' Culkeen said . Gordon reminded the board that the entirety of the SVSU budget is built into the district budgets . Even though the SVSU budget itself is going up close to 9 percent for fiscal 2021 , this budget is not , she said . D'Onofrio asked how the changes are being reported to the principals . Article Continues After These Ads Culkeen said he individually reached out to each principal in the district schools . `` So that they heard it directly from me , and did n't pick it up in the newspapers , '' he said . `` And I did express how the board was reluctant to -LSB- make those cuts -RSB- . '' Things like the outcome of healthcare negotiations and a lower student count has resulted in the `` perfect storm '' to impact this year 's budget , he said . `` Makes it a very difficult year to add anything , '' he said . It 's also a very difficult decision to not budget any contributions into the reserve fund , as that 's a risk that `` could come back to bite us at some point , '' he said . '' -LSB- But if -RSB- these cuts do n't go through , then we could be looking at reducing staff , and that 's what we 're trying to avoid , '' he said . Dick Frantz asked if there are any potential grants on the horizon . The only immediate one Gordon said she knows organizers are looking into is an equipment grant , in which $ 5,000 has been allocated to the budget for matching funds . Gordon also spoke with the board about particular expenditures , broken down by department/function . The category in this breakdown with the largest percent increase , by far , is in attendance/social work services , with a 12,212.7 percent increase to $ 61,564 . Chris Murphy , chairman of the board , asked Gordon what the current balance is in the reserve fund . The Bennington reserve account has a little over $ 157,000 , while Pownal 's is just over $ 332,000 , Gordon said . A year or two ago , Gordon said , a ballot article was approved by Pownal 's voters to move funds that had been set aside for the bus sinking fund to capital reserve . Shaftsbury has about $ 315,000 , but recent work on a ventilation project has not yet been paid from that account -- to the tune of about $ 167,000 , she said . Woodford has about $ 119,000 in their reserve account , she said . Revenue changes This year , Gordon said , the district is budgeted to receive an additional $ 47,00 in elementary tuition revenue . The district 's general state support grant is also budgeted to increase 6.98 percent over fiscal 2020 , to $ 22.4 million . This line essentially refers to what the district is requesting from the state education fund , she said . `` Any other revenues we have offset the demand that we place on the education fund , '' she said . The fund balance is also to decrease , from $ 1.9 million in fiscal 2020 to $ 728,665 . That is a good thing , Gordon said , as auditors have told them to get fund balances down . `` So we have done that , '' she said . `` But unfortunately , that actually reduces our offsetting revenue , so that 's going to drive up our tax rates . '' SVSU Budget The SVSU board passed its budget by a margin of 5-1 at a meeting on Jan. 2 , after much back-and-forth , during which multiple board members expressed concern over possible effects on taxpayers . The $ 27.7 million fiscal 2021 budget that represents an 8.87 percent spending increase over the current budget . The board initially had a tie vote of 3-3 ; after two board members , Ron Higgins and Brownell , changed their `` no '' votes , the budget passed by a margin of 5-1 . Frantz , chairman of that board , was absent . The largest increases over fiscal 2020 come from benefits , salaries and tuition , with a $ 1.02 million increase in benefits , more than half of which is attributable to higher costs for health insurance . Equipment , supplies and transportation are budgeted to decrease by $ 14,606 , $ 79,594 and $ 33,885 , respectively . The SVSU budget is the only one in the supervisory union not directly considered by the voters .

Lake said , now that he 's taken over , the first priorities were check off three boxes : Keeping the -LRB- then -RRB- current recruits committed and then signed . Win the bowl game and `` send Coach Pete out the right way '' Retain the coaches on staff -LRB- who were n't released -RRB- . Lake elaborated on that saying that there were lot of programs -LRB- and NFL clubs -RRB- who regularly try to `` pluck off '' members of the coaching staff , and added that it happens all the time , `` It 's the nature of the business '' . Lake said that now that those boxes are all checked , it 's time for the next phase ; which is to get the team back into the weight room . Softy was belaboring the fact that practices have been closed the past few years to the media , and Lake said if injuries were n't reported , the media could come in , `` There 's other people in the media who do love to report -LRB- on them -RRB- , we do n't need that out there . '' Lake said things like that and too-detailed practice reports are problematic for the program , and that coaches from every program read their opponent 's practice reports all the time . Lake said that Will Harris and Terrance Brown will be pretty autonomous with the DB 's , but that he will always be around to check on and coach up the DB 's , but also every other position group on the defense , What he 's really looking forward to , however , is getting to be around the offensive players more . `` I 'm excited to cheer on the offense '' , he said , noting that he 's always gone against them in practice . Lake said they will keep the `` culture '' that Chris Petersen implemented ; meaning Built for Life , and the `` anchors that have held this program down '' . He also talked about having a `` brick-layer attitude '' . He wants to see a `` state of growth and improvement '' and will continue to explore new trends from the NFL . As for what may be different ? Lake talked about the Husky offense , and said that there 's a `` mentality that 's been missing '' . He wants to see more attacking , `` I want defenses to have to deal with our stuff . '' He wants Washington 's offense to be physical ; an offense `` who will run the ball down your throat '' . As for the controversial -LRB- to the fans -RRB- hire of John Donovan , Lake said he spoke to many contacts in the NFL and Donovan 's name just kept coming up ; contacts from Green Bay , Tennessee , Seattle , etc. , `` My whole world changed when I coached in the NFL '' , Lake explained , `` I became a better X and O guy , a better leader , and after doing all the research and interviews I know this will be the same for John Donovan . '' Lake continued to reiterate that Donovan 's ideas are `` in line with what I want to see : physical , bruising attack with tight ends and fullbacks , empty sets and to be able to throw the ball . '' Lake finally said , `` John is a brick-layer and I ca n't wait for him to construct the offense . '' Lake wants to have the same success getting offensive guys to the NFL that he 's seen with defensive guys at Washington . He said Donovan will have autonomy , but will get input from the entire offensive staff -LRB- which is normal -RRB- . As for the defensive coordinating , Lake said he has complete faith in Pete Kwiatkowski and Ikaika Malloe . Now 's where it got interesting : Softy asked Lake if he had thought about who will be lining up behind center when the team takes the field against Michigan , Lake said `` We only have two on the roster right now -LRB- aside from incoming freshman Ethan Garbers -RRB- '' , but then he got about as candid on the subject as he could get when asked about the transfer portal , `` I 'll say this . . the best QB that ends up on the roster in August will be the starter for September 5th . '' On the subject of the transfer portal , Lake said it 's primarily a good place to look for quarterbacks . Asked if there 's anyone more who will be added to the recruiting class ? `` Yes , we really do hope to -- couple positions and some guys that we 've had on trips prior or who are still going through the process , a couple others too . '' Finally , Lake made a big announcement when he declared that there will be a proper , formal spring game this year -LRB- for the first time in nearly a decade -RRB- and he hopes to see the stands packed and for it to be a big event for fans .", "url": "https://realdawghuskies.com/jimmy-lake-talks-to-kjr-notes-and-quotes/", "kws": ["KJR", "Jimmy^^Lake", "Quotes", "Lake", "Dick^^Fain^^today", "Chris^^Petersen", "Dave^^Mahler", "John^^Donovan", "Seattle", "Softy", "Terrance^^Brown", "Green^^Bay", "freshman^^Ethan^^Garbers", "contacts", "too-detailed^^practice^^reports", "Pete^^Kwiatkowski", "line", "Washington", "defensive^^guys", "coaching^^staff"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 0.7072019577026367}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Football": 0.7072019577026367}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Football_Other": 0.7072019577026367}}}

Last year , the mother -LRB- Jana Kirchner -RRB- of a Keokuk wrestler took notice of how very badly the KMS wrestling team needed new mats . The old mats were more than 30 years old and were in dire need of replacement . The old mats had seen a lot of good matches , but it was time for them to go . Kirchner is a regular citizen of Keokuk who decided to start raising money for new mats and she did n't stop until the fundraiser was completed and the needed funds had been raised . Little did she know how much her enthusiasm and effort would have a snowball effect in a very positive way . Before you knew it , so many members of the community were donating to this great fundraiser that the goal was reached . Not only was it reached , but it was surpassed , so the leftover money was used to buy new warmups , which were also very much needed . The community knew the mats were very much needed and they also knew it was something that would last for many years to come . This is something that 's helping the youth of our community , as well as something that will help the students and coaches have more pride as a team . It 's so heartwarming to see and know that Kirchner 's efforts have paid off . And on Tuesday evening for the home meet , the crowd and wrestlers got to see the brand new mats rolled out and used for the very first time . The KMS wrestling team -LRB- as well as their coaches -RRB- were full of excitement . Kirchner said , `` These new mats only take two people to put out -- one person to butt the mat up while the other person rolls over it with the roller , locking the two together -- but tonight , the team helped . The mats went together smoothly and quickly and with a lot less effort . '' Coach Bruce and Coach Tommy Rose were the ones who picked a mat out . Coach Bruce said , `` It was great having the new mats tonight . The ziplock connection worked pretty slick . It cut our preparation time in half , not to mention they look awesome ! Now lets get more wrestlers on these mats . '' At the meet on Tuesday , Keokuk hosted Fort Madison and Mt. Pleasant Middle Schools .

1.0	{"docid": "0Nr9sZkw", "title": "' I was sexually abused by a shaman at an ayahuasca retreat '", "content": "The psychedelic powers of a traditional Amazonian plant medicine called ayahuasca are attracting more and more tourists . It 's said to bring spiritual enlightenment and to help with addiction , depression and trauma . But a string of allegations suggests there 's a darker side to the ayahuasca scene . Warning : this article contains details of alleged sexual assaults Rebekah first tried ayahuasca on a `` complete whim '' when she was travelling in Peru in 2015 . `` I thought it sounded interesting and I thought I might as well give it a try , '' says Rebekah , a New Zealander in her 20s who asked the BBC not to use her surname . `` So I found a retreat centre that I felt was good and I just went for it and it was amazing . '' Ayahuasca can induce visions of things like serpents , palaces , and alien beings - and bring up long-forgotten memories . Like many who 've drunk the brew , Rebekah has a wide-eyed distant look as she reminisces about the experience . `` It was like being guided very gently and very kindly through some really awful experiences that I 'd had in the past , '' Rebekah says . `` And returning back home after that , I felt like my relationships were a lot stronger . I felt it was a lot easier to share and receive love . `` They do say that ayahuasca is like 20 years of psychotherapy . And I completely believe that . '' Ayahuasca is usually taken in ceremonies at night , led by a healer - sometimes called a shaman . He or she will drink the sticky brown liquid - a brew of two Amazonian plants - then dole out helpings to the participants . It 's been used by tribes in the Amazon region for centuries but now there 's a boom in what 's become known as `` ayahuasca tourism '' , with ever more specialist retreat centres opening . Travellers often come for help dealing with mental health problems - and a growing body of scientific research suggests ayahuasca could be an effective treatment . About half an hour or so into a ceremony , the medicine takes its effect and the healer will start singing sacred chants , known as icaros , which guide the participants through their visions . Drinkers usually `` purge '' during ceremonies too , vomiting and sometimes getting diarrhoea as well . When Rebekah went on her first ayahuasca retreat , she was the only single woman there and noticed that the male healer was paying her special attention . `` How he treated me was very different , which I did n't find suspicious at the time . But upon reflection , now I do . '' A year later , by now a more experienced ayahuasca drinker , Rebekah returned to the same retreat in Peru . The same healer was leading the ceremonies . Once again , she says , she was treated differently from everyone else . There was a lot of flattery . Then the healer began confiding in Rebekah . `` He constantly told me that he had a lot of troubles , '' she says , `` and he said he was having problems with his wife , that he was n't sexually fulfilled , and that I was the one who was able to cure him of that . '' Rebekah was 20 at the time ; the healer in his 50s . `` He also promised me a lot of spiritual advancement or a lot of spiritual power , if we had a relationship - while his wife was down the road . '' Simon Maybin and Josephine Casserly 's documentary Ayahuasca : Fear and Healing in the Amazon on is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 's Crossing Continents on 16 January 2020 at 11:00 Or listen again on BBC Sounds Rebekah says the healer sexually abused her , coercing her into sexual acts . `` It 's disgusting , '' she says . `` Because he was a shaman , I thought he had moral superiority in a sense and I trusted him . '' After she was abused , Rebekah left the centre - and the country : `` I booked a flight and got the hell out of there . '' She was left with a tangle of painful emotions : `` Disgust , repulsion , betrayal - confusion , as well as to why a guide would do this , why a teacher would do this and why they would exploit their power like that . '' Rebekah 's alleged abuser is still the head shaman at his centre - which gets five-star ratings on review sites . `` He is still there , '' Rebekah says , clearly deeply angered by the situation . Her hands are visibly shaking . `` There are other centres that I know of as well that are still operating . There 've been multiple women that have been sexually abused in these centres . '' Experiences of sexual abuse seem to be widespread in this world . We 've heard numerous allegations against numerous healers and read many testimonies of sexual abuse on online forums . One name that comes up repeatedly is Guillermo Ar\u00e9valo , a well-known healer who 's been honoured by the Peruvian Congress for his work on sustainable development . `` He came to Canada many times , '' says a woman in her 40s whom we 're calling Anna . `` It was quite lucrative - big ceremonies . They 'd fill up fast , people paying C$ 300 -LRB- # 175 -RRB- to come and sit with Guillermo . He had kind of a status . It was an honour to sit in ceremony with him . '' Anna , who had long been interested in alternative medicine , hoped ayahuasca might help her deal with her addiction to heroin . At first , she was impressed by Ar\u00e9valo . `` Like a lot of people , you 're flabbergasted by the man 's presence and power and ability to lead the ceremony - it 's quite profound , '' she says . `` The chanting . He is a good healer . '' But a ceremony about seven years ago dramatically changed Anna 's opinion . `` It was completely pitch black , the room had no windows . There were a lot of people . `` I was under the effects of the medicine . When you 're under the effects there 's lots of different sounds . People are crying , verbalising things that make no sense at all , purging or moaning . `` Even if I had been able to say something , nobody would respond . '' Anna was having a difficult time . She recalls lying down , moaning and groaning . `` Guillermo came and he sat with me and at first it was a sense of relief because I think I 'm going to get some help , '' she says . `` He started to chant to me and put his hands on my stomach over my clothing which is normal . And then he put his hands down my pants . And there 's this sense of feeling frozen . I lay there in fear and then he put his hands up my shirt and felt around my breasts . '' She remembers thinking : '' ` What the heck was that all about ? ' Just a sense of disbelief and confusion . '' It 's taken six years for Anna to feel able to speak out about what happened to her . `` Women are conditioned to accept this behaviour . For myself , coming from a history of addiction - and I 've had abusive relationships with men that I 've tolerated in my life - and a history of childhood sexual abuse , there 's a sense of familiarity there , of normalcy . `` And also this weird co-dependent relationship for me where the medicine was helping me so I did n't want to speak up because I was afraid I would be ostracised from the community and then I would be kind of cut off from the medicine . '' Risks and benefits ? While preliminary scientific studies have suggested that ayahuasca could have therapeutic benefits , it contains DMT , which is illegal in the UK , and there are potential risks . A 2015 report found six volunteers with depression showed a decrease in symptoms after taking it . A separate study two years later indicated that it held promise as a treatment for eating disorders . Psychologists have also speculated that it could help those with PTSD . The Foreign and Commonwealth Office warns that some people have `` suffered serious illnesses and in some cases death '' after taking part in ayahuasca ceremonies . It points out that retreats are typically some distance from populated areas and that while some have basic medical facilities , others do not . Could ayahuasca have health benefits ? Around the same time , a group calling themselves Ayahuasca Community Awareness Canada - which included senior academics - put their names to a letter about Ar\u00e9valo 's behaviour and circulated it within the ayahuasca scene . The letter-writers say they took action because of the number of complaints made against the healer , citing reports of non-consensual or inappropriate sexual behaviour . When further named signatories were added to the letter in 2015 and it was made public , Ar\u00e9valo stopped visiting Canada to lead ayahuasca ceremonies . But when we track him down it seems he 's been active all around the world in the intervening years and is now based at a retreat centre in Peru . The place used to be called Anaconda but when we 're there has its first group of foreign guests under a new name , Bena Shinan . They 're milling around in a dining room behind us when we put the allegations of sexual abuse to Ar\u00e9valo , a slight 71-year-old with silver hair and gold teeth . `` I do n't accept the allegations because they 're not true , '' he says firmly . `` Because sometimes people just imagine these things . '' He says he 's heard about the letter by members of the Canadian ayahuasca community , but has never read it . `` It does n't interest me because the allegations are n't true , '' he says . `` It does n't bother me because I do n't think an allegation 's going to kill me . '' The claims against him , he says , are `` the imaginings of the unwell person '' . `` When you touch someone who 's been abused or raped , they think you 're the same . That 's what happens . That 's how I make sense of it . '' Will LSD ever be accepted as mainstream treatment ? When we put Anna 's specific allegation to him , he says he does n't remember ever touching a patient during a ceremony in Canada , saying she too must have imagined it . `` What else is he going to do other than just lie and deny it , '' Anna responds . `` Otherwise he would have to step up and take responsibility and be accountable for the way he has acted . '' What about his claim that she just imagined the sexual assault ? `` It sounds like gaslighting to me , really , '' she says . `` That 's what it feels like . '' Although Ar\u00e9valo denies having sexually abused anyone , he does admit that healers working under him have had sex with `` unwell people '' . He says he no longer works with those healers , but that in some cases it was the patients who initiated the relationships . `` Western women , when they come , they 're also seeking out healers , '' he says . Anna 's experience with ayahuasca and abuse does n't end with Guillermo Ar\u00e9valo . Despite her experiences with him , she did n't want to give up the benefits she received from the brew and continued taking it under the guidance of other healers . She says that in 2014 she was raped in ayahuasca ceremonies in Peru by a healer who is a member of Ar\u00e9valo 's extended family . She says again she `` just froze '' and `` let him do whatever he wanted to me '' . `` I think he probably raped me four or five times and I noticed he was doing it to other people . '' Afterwards , Anna says she was in shock . She does n't remember much about that period of her life . `` I started to develop symptoms of psychosis and ended up relapsing and becoming addicted to fentanyl and overdosed and almost died . I think I really blamed myself for a long time - why I could n't say no , why I could n't move , why I let him do those things . Those were the things that were going through my mind . '' We 've spoken to another guest who was at the same retreat as Anna , who says the healer was later sacked from the centre , because of allegations made by other clients . We 're not naming him because , despite our best efforts , we have n't been able to reach him to give him the chance to respond to the allegations . Emily Sinclair , a British doctoral student researching ayahuasca , is part of a group trying to raise awareness about the problem of sexual abuse in the ayahuasca world . Working with the Chacruna Institute , an organisation set up to share research on plant medicines and psychedelics , Sinclair has written the Ayahuasca Community Guide for the Awareness of Sexual Abuse . The guidelines highlight typical scenarios in which abuse happens . They also encourage people to drink with trusted companions and to research retreats by checking out review websites before they visit . Sinclair has been distributing the little green booklet to cafes , tourism offices and ayahuasca centres in the Iquitos area of Peru , known as the hub of ayahuasca tourism . `` A lot of abuse we 've found occurs in the context of individual healings where a woman might be asked to remove her clothes unnecessarily , '' she says . `` And when she 's in this unfamiliar context , she does n't know if that 's normal or not . '' Sinclair points out that it 's not just indigenous healers abusing Westerners . `` Abuse happens across cultures and within them , '' she says . `` But one of the big problems is that a lot of people who come here romanticise shamans . So we put them on a pedestal . And it 's very easy for that image to be taken advantage of . `` There 's also assumptions that some of the people here may have about Western women and culture . '' Some of the red flags Sinclair warns people to watch out for echo Rebekah 's experience . Information and Support `` If he 's overly touchy with you , he tells you his wife does n't mind him having sex with other women , he encourages pacts of silence and secrecy between you , he says he wants to teach you ` love magic ' . This kind of thing . And also that having sex with them will increase their power and energy . These are all things that have been reported to us as being said to women in this context . '' Those affected by sexual abuse understandably find it difficult to talk about openly . On top of that , there 's a strong sense within the ayahuasca world that any kind of negative publicity could result in government intervention , which creates an additional pressure to stay silent . But Rebekah and Anna are speaking out because they hope it will prevent other women being abused . `` I think the only thing we can do is just speak out about it and talk about it , '' Rebekah says , `` make sure people know that it 's happening . '' Rebekah says that after she was abused there 's been `` a lot of sadness and a lot of therapy '' . It 's been hard work for her to trust a healer again , but now she 's back in Peru , taking ayahuasca and researching her master 's thesis on indigenous medicine . `` Regardless of everything that happened , obviously ayahuasca 's great , '' Rebekah laughs , `` because I keep going back to it .

It 's said to bring spiritual enlightenment and to help with addiction , depression and trauma . But a string of allegations suggests there 's a darker side to the ayahuasca scene . Warning : this article contains details of alleged sexual assaults Rebekah first tried ayahuasca on a `` complete whim '' when she was travelling in Peru in 2015 . `` I thought it sounded interesting and I thought I might as well give it a try , '' says Rebekah , a New Zealander in her 20s who asked the BBC not to use her surname . `` So I found a retreat centre that I felt was good and I just went for it and it was amazing . '' Ayahuasca can induce visions of things like serpents , palaces , and alien beings - and bring up long-forgotten memories . Like many who 've drunk the brew , Rebekah has a wide-eyed distant look as she reminisces about the experience . `` It was like being guided very gently and very kindly through some really awful experiences that I 'd had in the past , '' Rebekah says . `` And returning back home after that , I felt like my relationships were a lot stronger . I felt it was a lot easier to share and receive love . `` They do say that ayahuasca is like 20 years of psychotherapy . And I completely believe that . '' Ayahuasca is usually taken in ceremonies at night , led by a healer - sometimes called a shaman . He or she will drink the sticky brown liquid - a brew of two Amazonian plants - then dole out helpings to the participants . It 's been used by tribes in the Amazon region for centuries but now there 's a boom in what 's become known as `` ayahuasca tourism '' , with ever more specialist retreat centres opening . Travellers often come for help dealing with mental health problems - and a growing body of scientific research suggests ayahuasca could be an effective treatment . About half an hour or so into a ceremony , the medicine takes its effect and the healer will start singing sacred chants , known as icaros , which guide the participants through their visions . Drinkers usually `` purge '' during ceremonies too , vomiting and sometimes getting diarrhoea as well . When Rebekah went on her first ayahuasca retreat , she was the only single woman there and noticed that the male healer was paying her special attention . `` How he treated me was very different , which I did n't find suspicious at the time . But upon reflection , now I do . '' A year later , by now a more experienced ayahuasca drinker , Rebekah returned to the same retreat in Peru . The same healer was leading the ceremonies . Once again , she says , she was treated differently from everyone else . There was a lot of flattery . Then the healer began confiding in Rebekah . `` He constantly told me that he had a lot of troubles , '' she says , `` and he said he was having problems with his wife , that he was n't sexually fulfilled , and that I was the one who was able to cure him of that . '' Rebekah was 20 at the time ; the healer in his 50s . `` He also promised me a lot of spiritual advancement or a lot of spiritual power , if we had a relationship - while his wife was down the road . '' Simon Maybin and Josephine Casserly 's documentary Ayahuasca : Fear and Healing in the Amazon on is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 's Crossing Continents on 16 January 2020 at 11:00 Or listen again on BBC Sounds Rebekah says the healer sexually abused her , coercing her into sexual acts . `` It 's disgusting , '' she says . `` Because he was a shaman , I thought he had moral superiority in a sense and I trusted him . '' After she was abused , Rebekah left the centre - and the country : `` I booked a flight and got the hell out of there . '' She was left with a tangle of painful emotions : `` Disgust , repulsion , betrayal - confusion , as well as to why a guide would do this , why a teacher would do this and why they would exploit their power like that . '' Rebekah 's alleged abuser is still the head shaman at his centre - which gets five-star ratings on review sites . `` He is still there , '' Rebekah says , clearly deeply angered by the situation . Her hands are visibly shaking . `` There are other centres that I know of as well that are still operating . There 've been multiple women that have been sexually abused in these centres . '' Experiences of sexual abuse seem to be widespread in this world . We 've heard numerous allegations against numerous healers and read many testimonies of sexual abuse on online forums . One name that comes up repeatedly is Guillermo Ar\u00e9valo , a well-known healer who 's been honoured by the Peruvian Congress for his work on sustainable development . `` He came to Canada many times , '' says a woman in her 40s whom we 're calling Anna . `` It was quite lucrative - big ceremonies . They 'd fill up fast , people paying C$ 300 -LRB- # 175 -RRB- to come and sit with Guillermo . He had kind of a status . It was an honour to sit in ceremony with him . '' Anna , who had long been interested in alternative medicine , hoped ayahuasca might help her deal with her addiction to heroin . At first , she was impressed by Ar\u00e9valo . `` Like a lot of people , you 're flabbergasted by the man 's presence and power and ability to lead the ceremony - it 's quite profound , '' she says . `` The chanting . He is a good healer . '' But a ceremony about seven years ago dramatically changed Anna 's opinion . `` It was completely pitch black , the room had no windows . There were a lot of people . `` I was under the effects of the medicine . When you 're under the effects there 's lots of different sounds . People are crying , verbalising things that make no sense at all , purging or moaning . `` Even if I had been able to say something , nobody would respond . '' Anna was having a difficult time . She recalls lying down , moaning and groaning . `` Guillermo came and he sat with me and at first it was a sense of relief because I think I 'm going to get some help , '' she says . `` He started to chant to me and put his hands on my stomach over my clothing which is normal . And then he put his hands down my pants . And there 's this sense of feeling frozen . I lay there in fear and then he put his hands up my shirt and felt around my breasts . '' She remembers thinking : '' ` What the heck was that all about ? ' Just a sense of disbelief and confusion . '' It 's taken six years for Anna to feel able to speak out about what happened to her . `` Women are conditioned to accept this behaviour . For myself , coming from a history of addiction - and I 've had abusive relationships with men that I 've tolerated in my life - and a history of childhood sexual abuse , there 's a sense of familiarity there , of normalcy . `` And also this weird co-dependent relationship for me where the medicine was helping me so I did n't want to speak up because I was afraid I would be ostracised from the community and then I would be kind of cut off from the medicine . '' Risks and benefits ? While preliminary scientific studies have suggested that ayahuasca could have therapeutic benefits , it contains DMT , which is illegal in the UK , and there are potential risks . A 2015 report found six volunteers with depression showed a decrease in symptoms after taking it . A separate study two years later indicated that it held promise as a treatment for eating disorders . Psychologists have also speculated that it could help those with PTSD . The Foreign and Commonwealth Office warns that some people have `` suffered serious illnesses and in some cases death '' after taking part in ayahuasca ceremonies . It points out that retreats are typically some distance from populated areas and that while some have basic medical facilities , others do not . Could ayahuasca have health benefits ? Around the same time , a group calling themselves Ayahuasca Community Awareness Canada - which included senior academics - put their names to a letter about Ar\u00e9valo 's behaviour and circulated it within the ayahuasca scene . The letter-writers say they took action because of the number of complaints made against the healer , citing reports of non-consensual or inappropriate sexual behaviour . When further named signatories were added to the letter in 2015 and it was made public , Ar\u00e9valo stopped visiting Canada to lead ayahuasca ceremonies . But when we track him down it seems he 's been active all around the world in the intervening years and is now based at a retreat centre in Peru . The place used to be called Anaconda but when we 're there has its first group of foreign guests under a new name , Bena Shinan . They 're milling around in a dining room behind us when we put the allegations of sexual abuse to Ar\u00e9valo , a slight 71-year-old with silver hair and gold teeth . `` I do n't accept the allegations because they 're not true , '' he says firmly . `` Because sometimes people just imagine these things . '' He says he 's heard about the letter by members of the Canadian ayahuasca community , but has never read it . `` It does n't interest me because the allegations are n't true , '' he says . `` It does n't bother me because I do n't think an allegation 's going to kill me . '' The claims against him , he says , are `` the imaginings of the unwell person '' . `` When you touch someone who 's been abused or raped , they think you 're the same . That 's what happens . That 's how I make sense of it . '' Will LSD ever be accepted as mainstream treatment ?

Sunday 's game against the 49ers in Santa Clara , CA will be their third title game appearance , and the hope the third time is the charm and they will advance to their first Super Bowl since 2010 . But oddsmakers have installed San Francisco as 7.5 point favorites for Sunday , in large part to the week 12 beatdown -LRB- 37-8 -RRB- they handed the Packers in the same stadium . Most everyone knows the 49ers are the favorites to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LIV ; and if the Niners themselves do n't know it , the Packers were making a concerted effort on Wednesday to inform them . Here 's what Aaron Rodgers had to say : `` I think if you look at this game , they are definitely favored by what , 7.5 points ? So they are obviously expected to hold court and win ; people know and are talking about how we played the last time . So I think if you look at pressure , the pressure is in a certain place and we should be nice and loose . '' And Davante Adams : `` This is a great opportunity , we understand what is in front of us . Nothing to lose , but a lot to lose , everything at the same time . But the pressure is really on them , they want out there and they dominated us in that last game , and we did not take care of business the way we should have . So we kind of bottled that up , that feeling , and we are ready to convert that into something great . '' Rodgers has been great enough in his career to win numerous individual awards . Several of his teammates probably deserved more awards this season ; specifically sack leader Za'Darius Smith , who despite his team leading 13.5 sacks and NFL leading number of QB pressures , was left of the Pro Bowl and All-Pro teams . He wore a t-shirt with the word `` snubbed '' under his jersey in the Divisional Playoff win over the Seahawks , flashing it after a sack of Russell Wilson . Rodgers was asked on Wednesday if his team , like some of its ' players , has been overlooked this season . `` I do know that there has been some incredible performances by our guys , and maybe they have n't got the recognition they deserve . I hope we all remember why we 're doing this though , it 's to win championships . And when you win championships , everybody wins . As someone who has won some of those individual awards , I 'd definitely trade those for a couple more rings .

Fullback Danny Vitale also returned to the practice field , although Wednesday 's workout was little more than a walkthrough .

The campaign called `` The H is for Human , '' launched on Monday and focuses on raising HIV awareness and includes a new website , HIVandME.com . A part of the campaign is specially branded condoms and their distribution . However , a volunteer committee member who helped create the campaign said he was told to stop distributing the condoms in an email from a fellow committee member followed up by a phone call from the governor 's office Wednesday afternoon . A few of the Utah-centric condom packages read : Greatest Sex on Earth Enjoy Your Mountin ' Toss the Jello Salad SL , UT Explore Utah 's Caves HIVandMe CondomWallets Final by Jennifer Weaver on Scribd A press release from the health department stated that most of the campaign is local public outreach efforts on the website , HIVandME.com , but also includes billboards , TV and radio commercials , along with social media messages . All of the information distributed is aimed at providing resources and support for those living with HIV , those at risk for the disease , or people trying to support a friend or family member living with the infection . The condom designs and `` tongue-in-cheek '' messages were created by the UDOH and advertising agency , Love Communications , said Michael Sanders , a volunteer UDOH committee member . He told 2News he was told to stop sharing the condoms . Sanders said he has been a member of the special HIV awareness committee for four years . He added that the campaign was funded last year from federal grants from the CDC Integrated HIV Surveillance & Protection Program for Health Departments and HRSA 's Ryan White Care Act Title II grant . Sanders said in a phone interview : We have worked so hard to get this program and information up and running and it 's vital . Our message is that HIV of today is different then it once was and we want to keep the general public up-to-date to understand how important it is to get tested so if you test positive you know the options available and if you test negative , then you know the options to remain negative . We want to explain what HIV is today in 2020 to reduce the stigma and enhance the lives of those living with HIV here in the state of Utah . Our goal is zero infections . Sanders said he began taking condoms to LGTBQ resource centers , college campuses , Utah Pride Center , bars and upcoming shows when he received the email to stop immediately . `` I was on my way to the University of Utah when I got word that it was about to be shut down by Governor Herbert 's office , '' he said . Sanders would not share the email he received with 2News but said he received a returned phone call from the governor 's office after he inquired about the instruction to stop sharing the condoms . He said : I was told it was an inappropriate use of taxpayer dollars . 2News received the following statement from the governor 's office just after 6 p.m. , Wednesday : The Governor understands the importance of the Utah Department of Health conducting a campaign to educate Utahns about HIV prevention . He does not , however , approve the use of sexual innuendo as part of a taxpayer-funded campaign , and our office has asked the department to rework the campaign 's branding . The UDOH also released the following statement : These condoms are an element of a larger campaign and are designed to resonate with target audiences and spark conversation about HIV . All condoms are latex , which prevent HIV and STIs . The condoms come in ` wallets ' which are small cardboard holders . The wallets have Utah specific euphemisms , or plays on words , and were inspired by other successful campaigns in the region , specifically in Alaska and Wyoming . They refer the condom owner to the website HIVandMe.com . These condoms are for anyone , but specifically were meant for Utahns who are at-risk for HIV and who are historically harder to reach through traditional communication channels . They were purchased with federal grant funds . Sanders said the committee members on the campaign comprised of representatives from the state health department , state and county health departments , members of the Intermountain Healthcare , University of Utah Health , and the U of U Clinic 1A . HIVandMe : Condoms What they are : The Prevention , Treatment and Care Program -LRB- PTCP -RRB- has distributed sex-positive and fun condoms that are designed to resonate with target audiences and spark conversation .

These condom wallets have Utah specific euphemisms , or plays on words , and were designed by our contractor Love Communications . They refer the condom owner to the website HIVandMe.com .

This includes those having casual sex , sex with multiple partners , sex with partners of unknown HIV status , and men who have sex with men .

Col. Anthony Retka , who retired earlier this month , was accused of abusive sexual contact against Jordana Kennedy , the wife of Lt. Col. Patrick Kennedy , at an off-base going away party in May 2019 . At the time , Lt. Col. Kennedy was director of staff for the 52nd Fighter Wing . Two months later , he took command of Spangdahlem 's 480th Fighter Squadron , under Retka 's command . Wing Commander Col. David Epperson took administrative action against Retka after the Office of Special Investigations completed its investigation last September , Gabe Myers , a spokesman for U.S. Air Forces in Europe-Air Forces Africa , said Tuesday . Criminal charges were not filed against Retka , Myers said . USAFE would not say which administrative action was taken against Retka , citing the Privacy Act . But administrative actions can include letters of reprimand , admonishment or counseling . USAFE said Retka chose to retire several months earlier than expected . Retka declined to comment , according to USAFE . Witnesses interviewed by OSI also described a history of `` unprofessional , sexist and misogynistic comments '' and inappropriate behavior on Retka 's part , including an inappropriate comment after an anti-sexual harassment skit . Witnesses also revealed that in 2004 , while he was a captain deployed to Kunsan Air Base in South Korea , Retka engaged in a prank called `` steamrolling , '' barging naked into sleeping pilots ' dorm rooms and rolling over them in bed until they woke up . Witnesses also told OSI investigators that while at Kunsan , Retka once placed a much smaller pilot -- who became extremely intoxicated as part of a squadron initiation rite and drunkenly tackled Retka -- in a chokehold and refused to let go . Witnesses said Retka 's chokehold was a `` full asphyxiation '' that caused the drunk pilot to lose consciousness and soil himself . The squadron commander was the only person strong enough to break Retka 's hold on the pilot , witnesses said . Myers said the administrative action was taken only in response to the dinner incident , not the other incidents described to OSI . Jordana Kennedy provided a copy of the investigation report to Air Force Times , which corroborated the report provided by another source . She spoke with Air Force Times Jan. 9 and agreed to be identified by name . According to the report , Retka , the Kennedys and other staff and family from the 52nd attended a farewell dinner for the former vice wing commander at the Schloss Neiderweiss restaurant on May 3 . Several witnesses told OSI the event was `` somewhat crowded , but relatively easy to navigate '' without bumping into other people . Shortly after the Kennedys arrived and began chatting with other guests in the center aisle of the dining room , the report said , Retka walked up to the group and pinched or touched a male colonel 's rear end . Immediately afterward , Kennedy told investigators and Air Force Times , she felt a man forcefully rub against her buttocks . She turned her head and saw it was Retka , who walked away . The colonel asked the group , `` Did somebody just touch my butt ? '' and Kennedy replied , `` Yeah , mine too , '' the report said . `` I felt his pelvis , his privates , his everything into my backside , '' she told Air Force Times . `` It thrust me forward . '' Her husband told investigators that Retka approached the group directly behind his wife and stood `` crowded subway close '' to her , which he described as awkward . She told investigators that about 30 people had previously passed through the center aisle without any physical contact , and that there was eight to 10 feet of open space behind her . Kennedy told investigators she was in shock and disbelief at what had just happened and felt numb , upset and uncomfortable . However , she did n't want to make a scene and ruin the evening , as she and her husband had gotten a babysitter to be able to go out for the night . `` I did n't want to make a big deal of it because the night had just started and I wanted to honor these nice people , '' Kennedy told Air Force Times . `` But at the same time , I wish I had -LSB- said -RSB- ` Tony , what is your goal ? Why would you put your privates beside my body ? ''' She told investigators that Retka came up to her a few minutes later , apologized , and asked if they were OK , to which she responded `` Yeah , Tony , we 're good . '' The report quoted Kennedy as saying Retka then replied , `` Okay , good , because you were -LSB- indistinguishable -RSB- target . '' Kennedy told Air Force Times that Retka said she was `` the non-intentional target . '' In a written statement to OSI , Retka denied he inappropriately touched Kennedy and that any contact was incidental and not done with the intent to abuse , humiliate or degrade her or for his own gratification . The venue was crowded , he said , and he turned his body sideways to move through a group of people . Retka said he was also carrying a tall glass of beer in front of him , and told someone else that Kennedy may have felt the glass against her . Things soon became even more uncomfortable for the Kennedys , Jordana said . As the wing 's director of staff , Lt. Col. Kennedy had been working directly for former wing Commander Col. Jason Bailey . But on July 3 , exactly two months after the incident at the dinner , Kennedy took command of the 480th Fighter Squadron . He was now working directly for Retka . Jordana Kennedy said having to be around Retka and his wife was `` crushing '' and `` super-stressful . '' She began to skip group events with spouses to avoid running into the Retkas , and said she recently had a panic attack when she thought they might show up . OSI investigators also uncovered reports of more questionable activity by Retka over the years , particularly while he was deployed to Kunsan around 2004 . Several witnesses said Retka then regularly engaged in the steamrolling pranks , sometimes while naked , the report said . Other pilots also engaged in steamrolling at the Kunsan dorms in the early 2000s , witnesses said , describing a frathouse-like atmosphere rife with pranks and heavy alcohol use that was more tolerated in the Air Force at the time . Retka returned to Kunsan in 2012 as a squadron commander . During that assignment , he was chastised by his wing commander for making an inappropriate joke after a skit on sexual harassment . A female officer acting in the skit played the part of a harasser who was badgering a junior male airman for a date and offering her number . Retka reportedly said , `` Yeah , what 's your number ? '' but apologized after being corrected by his wing commander . By the time Retka returned to Spangdahlem as a group commander , he was viewed by some as a bully who had a tendency to mock , disparage or undermine his subordinates . A female officer at Spangdahlem told investigators that in October 2018 , Retka tried to sidestep her authority by saying he would solve a particular issue with another male officer , and said , `` We will talk about this as men later , over cigars and scotch . '' Before the investigation concluded , Retka decided to retire several months earlier than originally planned , Myers said . His retirement ceremony was held Jan. 6 at Spangdahlem . Myers said retiring was Retka 's choice , and that he was not ordered or pressured to retire early . His retirement leaves the operations group without a permanent commander until June , when his official replacement will assume command . Lt. Col. Michael Driscoll , who was deputy commander under Retka , is now the group 's acting commander . Retka , who took over the operations group in August 2017 , was in his third year in command , and had already been planning to retire at Spangdahlem , Myers said . Operations group commanders typically serve two-year stints , Myers said , but Retka last year volunteered to extend his time in charge of the 52nd . In late September , Jordana Kennedy said in a memo to reviewing authorities that Retka should not be retained on active duty , and should be removed from command and leave the service . Kennedy said she is satisfied with how the investigation proceeded . She hopes that by sharing her story , she can help do away with the remnants of a culture that tolerated such behavior by leaders . `` I would like to get my voice back , '' Kennedy said . `` I really hope that the Air Force can grow and move forward in a more positive environment . And the time when it was OK to pinch someone 's butt or rub up against someone or make a derogatory or misogynistic comment , I really want to see those days go away and be behind us .

Although the 49ers did n't try to earn the second overall pick in the 2019 draft by going 4-12 in 2018 , it happened naturally . And it allowed them to selected defensive end Nick Bosa . And Bosa has helped fuel the 49ers to the No. 1 seed and , as of Sunday , hosting the NFC Championship . `` Things have a way of working out , '' quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo told reporters on Wednesday regarding his ACL tear that sparked San Francisco 's not-so-special season . `` I always told myself it was a blessing in disguise , the ACL and everything , and yeah we got Bosa out of it . That 's a pretty good trade-off I guess . Things have a way of working out I guess . This ride is crazy . You 've just got to roll with the punches . '' Coach Kyle Shanahan agreed with the idea that the injury to Jimmy G in 2018 helped lay the foundation for a special team in 2019 , and likely beyond . `` It 's definitely helped , '' Shanahan told reporters . `` Everything happens for a reason , and you need to get good players in , some difference-makers , and Bosa has definitely been a difference-maker . I 'm very glad we have him . I do n't wish 4-12 on anybody , but after going through it , it was nice what it brought us . '' Although Shanahan surely did n't intend to make a commercial for tanking , San Francisco 's experience underscores how losing can become #winning . So the next time your favorite team naturally or artificially falls apart in a given season , take heart . By the next season , your favorite team could be on the brink of the Super Bowl . Permalink 47 Comments Feed for comments Back to top 47 responses to `` 49ers are now happy they went 4-12 a year ago '' Does Jimmy G really think he 's a 9 win difference maker ? At least a few times this year -LRB- last weekend included -RRB- this team won despite Jimmy G. just ask the jaguars just ask the bunglas/bengals and let 's throw in the browns the latest and most glaring example of how playing to tank is sometimes the best plan I was down voted last year when I said Garrapolo 's injury last year was a `` blessing in disguise '' . Allowing the 9ERS another year to build depth and drafting key contributors this past draft in Bosa , Greenlaw , Wishnowski , Samuel . Funny how Jimmy G made the same comment to reporters today . It means that Seattle was about the only team with a winning record that the 49ers beat . Has worked fantastic for the Raiders over the past 20 years ! Also Lynch fleecing the Bears for the Trubisky picks did n't hurt either Only the players still on the team most likely . I am fairly sure the players who are no longer on the 49ers are not happy that they went 4-12 . The NFC West has been weird lately with teams getting super high draft picks for being so bad or very late draft picks for being in the playoffs/SuperBowl . Any team can own the top pick in the draft , if they are bad or lucky enough , but only a good front office can make a good use of it . The St. Louis Lambs traded away their early picks for more picks but it did not get them anything . Lynch thought that Solomon Thomas would be his elite pass rusher , but it did not turn out that way . He was pretty lucky he got a second chance . Some teams , like Seattle , do not even have a first round pick most of the last decade . I think a team is going to be better off to have a tank year , vs. staying average . If a team is average every year they are going to draft in the middle range on every round , now you are doomed to average . If a coach or G.M. is on the bubble they will trade away the team 's future to acquire top talent in an attempt to not get canned.The 49ers lucked out getting Jimmy for a second round pick and there was a new coach and G.M. , so no pressure on the management . If your really need a Q.B. you need the first few top picks . Every now and then a Cinderella Story , out of nowhere , star player is drafted . The law of averages is you are better off to be drafting number one in each round . When I see their success I think , hmm , maybe the Redskins can do something similar . Then I bust out laughing . Jalen Hurd is a good looking rookie yet to see regular season action yet . Bosa was a gift from football heaven given to the Niners to make up for the Aldon Smith and Ruben Foster debacles . John lynch as a gm is working out so far . Bengals come to mind here . Next year , who knows ? Right Jimmy ? Browns and Raiders picking at the top for many many years have not brought this success . They beat Green Bay as well 8-8 ,5 -11,2 -14,6 -10 probably had alot to do with it . #Dolphins . If they can draft even the league average as far as hitting on draft picks starting in the next couple of years , they have the potential to be very good . 49ers have the best defense ever in NFL History way better then the seahawks back when they won the superbowl ... . Richard Sherman is a shutdown Corner the best in the league !!!!!! Kyle Shanahan is a better coach then anybody in the league for sure !!!! If you think the 49ers won despite Jimmy G , you did n't watch the games . The haters just ca n't stand it Jimmy G is the most overrated qb in the league . The guys stat line mostly looks like 201yds 1td 2ints and 2FL week in week out . That run game , and defense has carried him all year . Shanahan has done a nice job scheming for him , but how long can jet sweeps , reverses , and dump offs work ? Does Jimmy G really think he 's a 9 win difference maker ? At least a few times this year -LRB- last weekend included -RRB- this team won despite Jimmy G. _ -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- You have no argument here . 2 years ago he took over a 1-10 team and went 5-0 and beat 2 teams that made the playoffs . All the evidence would show that he does make that big of a difference . In the last 3 years , the Niners are 4-20 without him and 20-5 with him . mjclementz says : January 15 , 2020 at 8:25 pm Does Jimmy G really think he 's a 9 win difference maker ? At least a few times this year -LRB- last weekend included -RRB- this team won despite Jimmy G. ************** Just look at the 49er 's record with and without Jimmy G . He came to 1-9 team and won the last 6 . He was lost for the season in 2018 and they went 4-12 and with him they 're 12-4 . It 's hard to argue . its all about good timing . Rams did the same thing back in 98-99 . And they won a SB . Will see what the 9 ' ers can do . for all the doubters ; all Jimmy does is win games . You are what your record says you are . he 's 22-5 . Romo being hurt helped dallas get Zeke . This happens if you know how to draft . Lions fan all nervously nod in unison . Shanahan 's big ego cost long-cursed Atlanta a SB title because running the damn ball & burning clock was n't good enough -- he kept calling pass plays so he could be the young `` genius '' who blew out Belichick . We in Atlanta hope Einstein never wins the big one . It the same way they 've been adding talent for the past 6 or 8 years . Be a bottom dweller , and amass high draft picks . Props to Bosa for staying healthy . Cool . I do n't think my Bears will be doing that . I could be wrong , but their bottom-of-the-barrel coaching changes and lackluster draft record under Pace do n't provide much hope . daysend564 says : January 15 , 2020 at 9:00 pm It means that Seattle was about the only team with a winning record that the 49ers beat . I hope that was sarcasm , otherwise that was straight up sour grapes . They beat both the Packers and the Saints in regular season -LRB- who were the # 2 and # 3 seeds going into the playoffs -RRB- . Their only 3 losses came while we were down both Dee Ford and Kwon Alexander . One was a loss to the Seahawks in which we were also down Kittle and E Sanders -LRB- and it was both left and right tackles first game back since weeks 2 & 3 -RRB- and another was to Baltimore , in their home stadium and it terrible weather -LRB- and again , defense was down players still -RRB- . The only surprising loss was to Atlanta but every team usually has one , so I will take it . Even that Atlanta loss was only due to a TD at the very end . That 49 ' ers defense is nasty ! No offense to title town , but should the 49ers rest some players to get ready for the Super Bowl ? californianewton says : January 15 , 2020 at 9:17 pm Any team can own the top pick in the draft , if they are bad or lucky enough , but only a good front office can make a good use of it .

Richard Sherman is a shutdown Corner the best in the league !!!!!! Kyle Shanahan is a better coach then anybody in the league for sure !!!! + + + No he is n't . He only plays one side of the field .

Pats picked nospeed harry ... 9ers pick deebo a few picks later . deebo = good ; harry = bad It was more than just Jimmy who got hurt last year . Half of the D was injured , among other 's on the O not named Jimmy . Is Jimmy a game changer ? Absolutely . Because he took advantage of the down-time and thoroughly learned the play-book . Couple that with an amazing draft class , some savvy FA moves , and here you go . Geoffrey Mendoza says : January 16 , 2020 at 12:32 am Romo being hurt helped dallas get Zeke . This happens if you know how to draft Yes and that was to their advantage for 3 years while on his rookie contract . Not a good draft pick now with that bloated contract and a huge drop-off with his production , this year . And that was with him having the best O-line in FB , above avg QB along with other talent . Paying Zeke and soon elite QB pay -LRB- to an above avg QB -RRB- . Does n't matter how well they draft , over paying these 2 will sink the franchise for years . Get use to more yrs of 8-8 or 9-7 . Cowboys just making the playoffs ... is the same as my Niners making the NFC title game or super bowl . Guess when your team has n't done crap in 25 years . . then this is as good as it gets for Cowboy fans lol It worked for them no doubt . Team has sucked for years and all those high 1st round choices have panned out . This is their year to win it all . If they do n't , there 's some players wanting to get paid big dollars . They ca n't pay them all and team will start experiencing what every other winning club does ... losing top notch players without replacing them . This , death and taxes are a constant . Another part of this story : the Niners have n't picked a QB in the 1st round in the last 15 years and only two in the last 40 years . By not trying to hit the QB lottery every season -LRB- AZ , Cleveland -RRB- and getting talent everywhere else they were able to actually build a decent team around Garoppolo .", "url": "https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2020/01/15/49ers-are-now-happy-they-went-4-12-a-year-ago/", "kws": ["49ers", "canned.The^^49ers", "Niners", "Rams", "NFL", "Seahawks", "Bengals", "Cowboys", "Pats", "Lions^^fan", "Saints", "Redskins", "defensive^^end", "quarterback", "happy", "super^^bowl", "Belichick", "quarterback^^Jimmy^^Garoppolo", "yeah", "games"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Football": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Football_NFL": 1.0}}}

Voters send messages to politicians and the press about what they will tolerate and what they wo n't . The Democrats have n't voted yet , but they 've been campaigning for more than a year . They have just held their last debate before the Iowa caucuses two weeks from Monday . That 's time enough to learn some useful things , from the majority of the two-dozen-plus declared candidates who have already dropped out and from those still in the race . The first thing we 've learned is that voters , Democratic voters , have a limited appetite for free stuff . Many candidates have been promising free college , free healthcare , and free Ben & Jerry 's ice cream . Sounds good at first , as when Elizabeth Warren backed Bernie Sanders 's Medicare for All proposal . But the refusal of the `` I have a plan for that '' candidate to say how she 'd pay for it did n't fly . And , when she did answer the question , that flopped , too , and she fell back on saying it would be delayed until her second two years or second term . The second thing we 've learned is related : As blogger Glenn Reynolds puts it , `` Go woke , go broke . '' Kirsten Gillibrand , Beto O'Rourke , Kamala Harris , Julian Castro , and Cory Booker , all candidates who have held some moderate stands in the past and could have played them up , chose instead to emphasize how hip they were . They embraced positions such as free medical care for illegal immigrants , reparations for descendants of slaves , and abortions for men who have transitioned to become women . These things sound reasonable to fans of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez . To Democratic primary voters , not so much . All five are now ex-candidates . Third , identity politics has proven to be a loser , too . Harris and Booker got only single-digit percentages from black voters . Castro made zero progress with Hispanics . Things were quite different in 1988 , when Jesse Jackson carried blacks , Michael Dukakis won white ethnics , Al Gore won southern whites , and Dick Gephardt won union members . Identity politics is big on campus , where you get denounced for wearing a serape on Halloween if you do n't have Mexican ancestors , but voters do n't care so much . Harris and Booker failed to duplicate the frisson inspired by President Barack Obama in 2008 , probably because you can only elect the first black president once . Catholics were similarly excited by John Kennedy in 1960 but have n't necessarily been inspired by any Catholic candidate since . Fourth , the white college graduates , or gentry liberals , who are for the first time in history one of the Democratic Party 's largest constituencies , are a fickle bunch . Black and elderly Democrats have consistently given Joe Biden large pluralities , and Hispanic and the low-income noncollege Democrats have shown some affinity for Sanders . That largely accounts for the buoyancy of the support for these 77 - and 78-year-old candidates . But gentry liberals have been bouncing around . They were briefly smitten with Harris after she bopped Biden on school busing , they swooned longer for Warren when she kept repeating , `` I have a plan for that , '' and then they were charmed by Pete Buttigieg 's crisp and self-assured articulateness . The gentry liberals ' fling with Harris did n't last long , and current polling suggests their crushes on Warren and Buttigieg are over . But there 's still plenty of room for these voters , numerous among those who bother to attend Iowa caucuses and demographically a large share of the population of New Hampshire , to swing decisively in February 's first two contests . That 's what happened in 2008 , when high-education Iowans swung to Obama . That convinced black voters that he , unlike Jesse Jackson , could win whites ' votes and the nomination . But gentry liberals are hard to gauge , because what they 're after is not government aid but morally satisfying reassurances -- not substance , but style . Finally , Democrats , or their many friends in the press and social media , have an obsessive yearning for `` diversity , '' which turns out to mean racial quotas and preferences . There is moaning about not having any `` people of color '' on the latest debate stage , as if the party had a responsibility to somehow field a group of candidates demographically identical to the population . Actually , the six candidates at the last debate come from a wide range of backgrounds , reasonably appropriate for a party which , in its 188-year history , has always been a coalition of out-groups . What 's important is not what the field of candidates looks like but who will be its nominee , who will inevitably be of one gender and a limited number of ancestries . But who that will be is something Democratic voters have not told us yet .", "url": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/what-weve-learned-so-far-from-the-democratic-race", "kws": ["Democratic^^voters", "Democratic^^primary^^voters", "race", "Democrats", "Iowa^^caucuses", "Elections", "Bernie^^Sanders", "debate", "Joe^^Biden", "politicians", "President^^Barack^^Obama", "identity^^politics", "Michael^^Dukakis", "Dick^^Gephardt", "Things", "78-year-old^^candidates", "gentry^^liberals", "Hispanics", "Catholics", "blacks"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Federal": 1.0000100135803223}}}

That 's Rape '", "content": "Three of the women speaking out about their alleged experiences with Russell Simmons want to be clear when they claim : he raped them . In an interview with CBS This Morning , Drew Dixon , Sil Lai Abrams , and Alexia Norton Jones opened up to network correspondent Michelle Miller about the hip-hop mogul ; each woman alleged he forced himself on them without their consent . Jones -LRB- above , insert -RRB- described his behavior as `` penetral rape , '' to which Dixon added : `` This is violently tackled and raped -- while saying no and fighting and crying . '' Dixon went on to recall the alleged encounter with Simmons she says occurred 25 years ago . She shared : `` I literally worked for him . He was ordering me a car , and he told me to come upstairs and pick up a demo . I thought I would be in his apartment for five total minutes . That 's it ... And he showed up naked , wearing a condom , and tackled me to his bed , while I screamed and fought and said , ` No , ' and cried . That 's rape . '' Dixon was one of the first women to come forward with accusations against the Def Jam Recordings co-founder . In 2017 , she told The New York Times she was working her `` dream job '' as an executive at Def Jam in 1995 but allegedly endured `` prolonged and aggressive sexual harassment '' by Simmons . Dixon claimed the mogul made sexual comments toward her , asked her to sit on his lap during a meeting , and frequently exposed his erect penis to her . She said this nasty alleged behavior reached a crescendo when he allegedly raped her in his NYC apartment ; she claimed after Simmons pinned her to his bed , she blacked out despite not having alcohol before waking up naked in his hot tub . Abrams , who casually dated Simmons in the early ` 90s , alleges he raped her in 1994 when she was too drunk to consent . Holding back tears , she said : `` He 'll say , ` Yes , we had a sexual relationship , ' but he can not address the fact that I was too drunk to consent , and that the next day I called him up , screaming . And I attempted suicide . He knew . And I told him why : That he had ruined my life , and that I had nothing . '' Jones also fought tears when she claimed that Simmons raped her on their first date in 1990 , `` right up against the f**king wall . '' The two did not date again afterward , and the then 21-year-old felt she `` had to keep this secret . '' She recalled : `` This was a very swift attack , and what was going through my mind more than anything was , ` Why ? ' I liked Russell ... I would 've just kissed him . I would 've made out with him . He did n't have to attack me . '' Wow . Watch a clip of the interview -LRB- below -RRB- to see how visibly triggered these women truly are . First on @CBSThisMorning : We 're hearing from women interviewed for a new documentary who claim music mogul Russell Simmons violently assaulted them . @CBSMMiller spoke to three of the women in the documentary . Simmons has denied the allegations . https://t.co/nd8J02H4HJ pic.twitter.com/2TliAIFgG6 -- CBS This Morning -LRB- @CBSThisMorning -RRB- January 15 , 2020 The music mogul issued a statement in response to the network 's new interview , in which he once again denied the `` false accusations . '' It read : `` I have issued countless detailed denials of the false accusations against me , including pages of sworn witness testimony including family members , clergy , journalists and mutual friends who were present at every stage . These denials have been validated by my passing nine prosecution-grade lie detector tests . '' The 62-year-old went on to say he has `` admitted to being a massively unconscious ` playboy ' which today is appropriately titled ` womanizer , '' adding : `` What I wo n't do is engage in a shootout of attacks and counter-attacks . The social change from today 's activism is more important to the world my daughters will inherit than any dirt from false accusations from nearly 40 years ago . '' The three women were interviewed for a related yet-to-be-titled documentary highlighting the many allegations that have been levied against him . Simmons made his feelings about the doc , which is set to premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this month , known on Instagram by sharing a photo of himself and Oprah Winfrey -- who bowed out of her executive producer role on the project last week -- and yet again denied the allegations . He wrote : `` I am guilty of exploiting , supporting , and making the soundtrack for a grossly unequal society , but i have never been violent or forced myself on anyone . Still I am here to help support a necessary shift in power and consciousness . Let us get to work on uplifting humanity and put this moment and old narrative behind us . '' Um ...

Gay and bisexual men have experienced the most dramatic decline in new infections , with rates falling by 73 % . It has been attributed to a rise in the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis -LRB- Prep -RRB- . Campaigners are urging the government to make Prep , which is almost 100 % effective at preventing transmission , more widely available . Virally suppressed Of the estimated 103,800 people living with HIV in the UK in 2018 , 93 % have been diagnosed with the virus . Of these , 97 % are receiving treatment . And of these , 97 % are , as a result , undetectable , meaning they can not transmit the virus . Among gay and bisexual men , transmissions of HIV have dropped from 2,300 in 2014 to 800 in 2018 . HIV testing has greatly increased over the past decade . And the number of men who have sex with men living undiagnosed with HIV has halved between 2014 and 2018 , to 3,600 . Impact trial Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK was on track to achieve its goal of ending HIV transmission by 2030 . `` I feel very strongly that we must end HIV transmission , '' he said . `` HIV has brought untold hurt and suffering to so many , so it is encouraging to see transmissions continue to fall across the UK . '' Prep is currently freely available for high-risk patients in Scotland but many in England have had to wait until they can gain access to an impact trial that first began in September 2017 . And as of October 2019 , at least 15 people in England have tested HIV positive while waiting for a place on the trial . What is Prep ? A pill taken daily or on demand prior to having sex , to prevent HIV infection If taken consistently , when a condom is not worn and someone comes into contact with HIV , it protects cells in the body and disables the virus to stop it multiplying A UK Medical Research Council-run study found an 86 % fall in new HIV infections among gay men on Prep compared with non-users Many in the sexual-health sector say Prep , when taken correctly , is almost 100 % effective It is aimed at men who have sex with men without a condom as well as others at high risk , including HIV-negative partners of individuals with HIV that is not virally suppressed Researchers are assessing demand for the drug and its effect on the number of new HIV infections ` Get a grip ' Phil Samba , of advocacy group Prepster , told BBC News that while the new data was incredibly promising , the lack of commitment from the government to making Prep widely available in England remained troubling . `` The figures show the impact that Prep , combined with increases in HIV testing and rapid access to HIV treatments can have . `` We truly are living in a new era of HIV prevention . `` Yet , Prep is still not freely available on the NHS in England and unnecessary HIV infections are happening because of foot-dragging by politicians . `` Today , we make a clear call to Matt Hancock and his colleagues , ` Get a grip and fund a full Prep service now . ' '' Late-stage infections Terrence Higgins Trust head of policy Debbie Laycock said a focus beyond communities stereotypically associated with HIV was now needed . `` The fact we are still seeing 43 % of all new HIV diagnoses at a late stage , in particular among heterosexual men and the over-50s , is evidence of the urgent need to engage these groups around HIV and regular testing . '' Late-stage infections have more than a tenfold increased risk of death in the year following diagnosis compared with those who are diagnosed early and begin treatment immediately .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrAvO6k", "title": "8 Tricks Make up Artists Use ...", "content": "No makeup trick is ever too much , especially if you like to try out new things and explore this wonderful world that 's known to everybody and available to us , women , only . That 's why I 've combined some of my favorite pro makeup tricks that could come handy to both beginners and girls that have been using makeup for quite a bit now . 1 . Play with Your Foundation Do n't get all desperate if you ca n't find an ideal foundation shade or realize the shade that fits you perfectly makes your face appear too pale or dull on photos or under neon lights . Pro makeup artists often use more than one shade of foundation to get the color and the effect they were going for . Get a lighter and darker shade to mix together or a special one that comes with a special tint that enables you to make lighter or darker shades , depending on your preference . If you think your foundation is too heavy for daywear or you do n't need all that coverage that often , simply make a light version by mixing it with your day cream . Alternatively , you can get one of those foundations with shiny particles -LRB- like Rimmel Recover -RRB- and apply it on parts of your face that need to look shiny and fresh . Now , about this last tip , let me share something from personal experience -- if you 're thinking about trying out Recover , use it only as describe above , because it does n't provide much coverage and appears too shiny on photos . \u2193 next \u2193 2 . Shiny VS. Matte When getting ready for a special event of some kind , it very important to know which parts of your face should be covered with shiny particles and which ones should remain matte . So , if you want your face to look fresh rather than greasy on photos , pro artists suggest you should keep the shine low on the center of your face . Apply translucent powder on your nose , chin , and forehead and leave the sparkles for cheeks , eyes and lips . \u2193 next \u2193 3 . Make Your Lipstick Last Longer We all know lipstick comes off , not matter how waterproof , kiss-proof , eat or drink-proof it 's supposed to be . To avoid smears that just wo n't come off or horror of realizing that half of your extra durable lipstick came off and the other half wo n't even budge , prep your lips using the oldest trick in the book -- lip pencil . Now , these are definitely worth investing some cash in , especially if you are going to be wearing a dark lipstick . Just apply it like you would normally apply any lipstick and voila ! \u2193 next \u2193 4 . Plump , Juicy Lips Well , I 'm sure most of you know about this , but I just ca n't avoid mentioning it and I 'm about to tell you why . You see , a lot of self proclaimed makeup artists here prefer to go outside the natural lip contours and always apply a thick layer of lip gloss all over . Yes , it does look great on pictures , but only if the camera is not too close to you , otherwise it will capture what 's evident to everybody around you -- that your lips look like a big , messy shapeless blob ! So do n't mess with the Mother Nature a lot -- there is a more subtle and equally effective way to look good , live and on photos . Dab on a very glossy , reflective clear lip gloss on the center or your lover and upper lip ! \u2193 next \u2193 5 . Instant Freshness Lip gloss in Nude is something we have in our purses at all times , is n't it ? Well , according to famous and , I daresay , very skilled makeup artist , Gina Brooke , there 's more than one way to use that gloss ! So , in those times when you look tired or your skin is lacking that natural shine and you have no other ways to `` fix things '' , smear a little bit of that lip gloss over the apples of your cheeks . Not too much ladies as you do n't want your skin to look greasy but radiating and naturally glowing . \u2193 next \u2193 6 . Bronzer `` boob-job '' I absolutely love , love , love this trick and if you , like me , do n't have a lot of cleavage to show , I 'm sure you 'll love it too ! Now , this is too messy to use every day and I doubt you 'll need a pair of double Ds to do your grocery shopping , finish up those financial reports or attend a PTA meeting but , special times call for special measures -LRB- special , not desperate ! -RRB- . So , when you need that breathtaking cleavage , simply use your foundation and bronzer and paint it on by shading an imaginary curvy line that would have been there if your boobs had managed to go up two sizes overnight . Makeup artists use this trick to accent abs and boobs for underwear campaigns too , so if all those models are not embarrassed for faking features that are supposed to be a big part of their job , why should you be ? \u2193 next \u2193 7 . Long Wear What would you do if you need to get ready for an important event and you have just ran out of your primer potion or spray you use to prevent the makeup from fading away ? Stay at home ? Opt for a bag big enough to hold your first aid makeup kit ? Nope ! Here 's a little trick I 've managed to pick up while waiting on my turn at the beauty salon -- light hold hairspray ! Shake it , spray it some inches in front of you and just gently close your eyes and walk through that mist . It 's not something you should practice every day but it 's a great first aid solution in case the unimaginable actually happens and you forget to re-stock your makeup bag . 8 . Thicker Lower Lashes Do n't know about you but my lower lashes just do n't respond to any conventional procedures . They are long and every product I use makes them even longer , so long that they actually start to curl and poke . However , the volume just is n't there . A non-existent category ! Volume ? What ? What is that ? Could you define that term , please ? Now , here 's the trick I use and I picked it up reading an article in Cosmo -- apply mascara , clear smudges -LRB- if any -RRB- , take a very thin eyeliner brush and draw a tiny line wherever you feel like you could use an extra eyelash or two . Do n't be afraid to use this tips , ladies . After all , did you really think an average celeb really looks THAT good without the help of a pro makeup artist and 3 sideshows to wheel all that makeup in and out of the place ? Which one of these tricks you feel like your could use the most ?

The studio , with a breathtaking view of the Portland skyline , is where the blonde-haired MC breathed fierce life into the bulk of her sparkling 2019 debut mixtape If I May . . , which sees the artist genuinely confronting her privilege , setting admirable intentions , and slaying complicated , reference-heavy rhymes over monstrous production . A week before Wynne hit the road to join EarthGang 's `` Mirrorland '' tour , flanked by b-boy/hype man Rafael `` Raf '' Newman and engineer Itay Lerner , I went to chop it up with her about all the exciting moves she 's made , her decision to stay in Portland , and what she still hopes to bring home to the Rose City . MERCURY : So how are you doing ? I heard you slipped a disc ? WYNNE : I 've had so many health issues in the last month , it 's been horrible . I just kind of have a bad back and then I got hit by that car -- that was two years ago -- and my back never really fixed itself . And so we started preparing for the show and for tour : I 'm going to the gym everyday , I 'm running on the treadmill -- which I 'm not supposed to do because I do n't have a disc between two of my vertebrae , so impact is not great . Ended up slipping a couple discs and could n't really walk for a couple days during rehearsal . Supposed to be wearing a back brace 24/7 , but forgot it today . And I got really sick , I 'm kinda getting over it now . Had a three-week virus , a cold . But feeling better ! Ready to leave in a week ! Good ! I had so much fun at your `` Hunny I 'm Home '' Hawthorne Theatre homecoming show . WYNNE : I 'm so glad you came ! How will this `` Mirrorland '' tour performance compare to that ? Will there be a live band ? Totally no . Super no . We wanted to make the hometown show something special because we 've turned down a lot of great opportunities in order to really present my first headlining moment as its own thing . So we wanted to go all-out , obviously . We were so lucky to have the Amazon partnership that allowed us to bring in a creative director and build the big beehive that hung from the stage , and bring the bear , have the little vine installation , have the band . -LSB- This new set -RSB- is still gon na be special . We had a music director help us build out that `` Hunny I 'm Home '' set , and we 've taken those elements to bring on tour with us . Raf , hype man extraordinaire , is obviously coming . We 'll have a big LED video screen that EarthGang 's letting us use , so we 've got some good content going on . So it 'll be special , but it 's an opening set . How did the connection between EarthGang and you come about ? We built a really solid relationship with the SinceThe80s crew . SinceThe80s is a management company -- I think they 're starting a label branch -- but it 's Kei Henderson , Barry -LSB- `` Hefner '' Johnson -RSB- and Zeek -LSB- Nicholson -RSB- . They manage J.I.D. of EarthGang and 21 Savage . So through our J.I.D. relationship , EarthGang became familiar with us , and it just made sense for us to hop on as opener for their tour 'cause our fanbases align . How have you been preparing for this tour ? I know you said you 've been doing your physical therapy and have to continue with that ... A lot of physical therapy . The `` Hunny I 'm Home '' rehearsals helped us prepare quite a bit because the set length will be fairly similar . Obviously , going to the gym , trying to get ready to be healthy for six weeks , which is a challenge . But we rehearse every day , Raf and I. Got my in-ear monitors for the first time , which is an adjustment . And you know , spending as much time as I can with family and friends before we go out and making sure we have a comfortable van is important . What 's the setlist like ? It 's about half-project , half singles . I 'm coming out to `` Buzzer . '' The second song that follows that is called `` Obitchuary , '' but it 's not released . It 's produced by Christo who also produced `` Fine Things . '' He 's J.I.D. 's producer . I 'm gon na do `` Rose City . '' I 'm gon na do `` Ego Check , '' obviously . `` Fine Things , '' `` Do n't Touch , '' and I think I 'm gon na do the `` KOD -LRB- Remix -RRB- '' cause Dreamville fans , they need that . Especially if they 're unfamiliar with an opener , they want something to make them familiar . So if I can crush a J. Cole beat in front of them , that might give me an edge up . We 're packing like eight songs into 20 minutes , so ... it 's thick . `` Ego Check '' feat . J.I.D. is one of my favorites on the album for sure . I do have some questions : What do you mean when you say `` I do n't see anybody waitin ' / I prefer you say congratulations '' ? Who is talking to whom here ? `` Ego Check '' was actually a weird story . I was such a nerd in high school . I never really fit in and did n't go to parties . Just kind of stayed in my room and wrote music . And now all those kids who bullied me in high school are like , `` Hey we should hang out , '' and `` Hey , I always knew you 'd make it . '' And so those background vocals are me standing in the venue looking at the people waiting -LSB- in line -RSB- : No one 's in here , you do n't know anybody here . And like , I prefer you say `` Congratulations '' to me for getting in here . There had just been a bunch of parties in LA , and Ty -LSB- Lerner -RSB- and I -LSB- would -RSB- go to mingle and to meet people and to network . And we are lucky enough to have team members who allowed us to skip the line . I remember seeing people I knew , just like walking past them and getting in . That 's kinda sick . And then the night that we recorded it , we went to a Swizz Beatz party in downtown Hollywood , and we could n't get in for like an hour . We 're just like standing out there . At that point I 'd already written the lyric , and we were recording it , and I go `` I 'm gon na name this song ` Ego Check , ' because I can be both of these people . '' Are you gon na make a music video for it ? Yeah , Lord willing . Any other songs off the album you 'd ideally like to make a music video for ? For sure . We 're in the process of shooting a `` Rose City '' video . We have a couple of logistics that we need to flesh out , but hopefully we finish filming before we leave for tour . And we could do kind of a short-film-trio situation for `` Hungover , '' `` Playa '' and `` Petty '' because they are kind of a story . So to maybe do half of one song that leads into another , and the other one 's kind of an outro ... that 's a possibility . And then , for `` 212 \u00b0 , '' how did you connect with Mahalia ? I 've been a fan of hers for a really long time , ever since she released her Colors video , and I heard `` Sober , '' and I was like , `` Holy shit , that 's my favorite song of the year . '' I made the record with Sounwave first , and Mahalia is actually signed to the same publishing company as me , which is also where Parisalexa is . And so we had kind of known similar people . Someone on my management team , -LSB- who -RSB- knew that Mahalia was also kind of working with Sounwave through our publishing company , hit us up and was like , `` Hey , my friend produced a lot for Mahalia and she 's in LA right now . She has one more night here . It 'd be great to get you guys in the studio and see if she 'd be down to work on the song . '' She pulled up on us later that night , I think . For the first two hours , we just talked and just kicked it because it 's so rare that you meet another young woman who 's doing shit in music . We just became friends pretty quickly . We were pretty comfortable with each other . And just kind of told stories , we had a lot of weird stories with producers and people we knew that we could connect about , and she ended up wanting to lay it down on the song so we did that and she 's just ... she 's dope . Cool ! So I 'm sure you guys will probably do more work together in the future . Totally . Totally . Cool cool . I kind of already asked you about your setlist , but will you be performing `` Open Letter to Donald Trump '' on tour ? I will not be . That 's a song that I would like to save for ... I do n't know . That 's a really good question actually because it 's a very important time . It 's hard to sort of pay attention to the audience you 're playing for and fill 20 minutes . You also want to play fairly recent material . But we are releasing -- soon hopefully -- an acoustic version of `` Open Letter '' I did with Banana Stand , and we filmed that . So we 're gon na release that hopefully in the next month ... Our publicist got really sick so we 're trying to figure out how to release that in the best way . It 's super timely right now , unfortunately . I mean it 's been timely since you dropped it . Fuck . Yeah , so that 'll be coming soon . Shifting gears ! You 've had all these viral moments , big looks , cosigns , and high profile features at this point -LRB- like the BET Awards -RRB- . Do you have any awkward or unexpected celebrity encounters ? This was n't weird , but after the BET Awards , we had gone out to Nobu Sushi with my team , my publicist . And we turn around , and Anderson . Paak was sitting there with his girlfriend or his fianc\u00e9e . And my manager walks up to him -- and he did n't know him -- but he was like `` Hey Anderson , we have a couple mutual friends . I just want to introduce you to my artist Wynne . '' And I 'm like sitting at this table and I 'm like `` Holy shit , I love Anderson . Paak . '' Like `` Holy shit , Anderson . Paak is sitting right behind me . '' I 'm looking at my publicist like `` What are we gon na do right now ? Court just walked over there ! He 's like , having dinner ! '' And I hear Anderson go `` Wynne ! '' And I like turn around , and he 's like -LSB- motions to come over -RSB- , he 's like `` Sit down ! '' and he pulls out a chair , I sit down with him , he like pours out a shot of sake , he goes `` This is your first awards show !? '' I 'm like `` Yeah ! '' He goes , `` Cheers ! '' Aww ! We sat there for 10-15 minutes with him . He 's super nice . Just like a genuine dude . That was probably my coolest moment . And legendary live . Yeah , definitely one of the best live shows I 've ever seen . Whew ! He blew my mind . It was the Malibu tour at -- Crystal ? Yeah ! I was in the VIP section and I was like , `` I 've never seen a crowd this dancey in Portland . '' What 's cool is I waited two or three hours outside of the venue to meet him with my Malibu vinyl and he finally came out and I gave it to him and he signed it . And I go , `` In three years , I 'm gon na work with you , '' and we took a picture together . And when I sat with him at Nobu , I told him that . And he was like `` Holy shit ! '' And I was like `` Yeah man , it 's about time . We got ta knock it out now . '' So that 's one I 'm trying to manifest for sure . What artists or albums are in your heavy rotation right now ? Roddy Ricch . Love that album . Fuck ! -LSB- His Portland show -RSB- is the day we leave . Yeah we go to Seattle that day . That sucks ! Damn ! I 've been listening a lot to his album . I 've been listening a lot to Baby Keem . I listen to Summer Walker 's project a lot . That was probably my most played project of the year . Listening quite a bit to the new Ant Clemons . Spent a lot of time listening to Xavier Om\u00e4r 's project with Sango . And yeah , those are probably my most recent . And I 've been listening to Lucky Daye 's project since it came out . How has the reception been for your album If I May . . ? Does it feel like everyone 's saying ` Yes , you may ' ? Yeah . -LSB- Laughs -RSB- It feels like that . You know , when we started working on the project it was Ty and my goal to make something we felt could stand the test of time and that we 'd look back on and be proud of , not embarrassed . And that 's part of the reason we built this room : to have a safe space to work on the project . To see the reactions of people -LSB- to the project -RSB- be exactly what we wanted is not something you can ever prepare for . And a lot of people have been like `` Yo , I found you off the J.I.D. feature and had no idea who you were and suddenly you dropped my favorite hip-hop project of the year . '' And that to me is -LSB- huge -RSB- . Because it 's one of my favorite hip-hop projects of the year . I feel like I gained a lot of trust in myself and in my team , mostly Ty . -LSB- We -RSB- know what our goals are and we work towards them , and those things are achievable if you put in what you want to get out . So I felt not lucky , but blessed . `` To see the reactions of people -LSB- to the project -RSB- be exactly what we wanted it to be is not something you can ever prepare for . '' How would you characterize your fanbase ? It 's mostly men . It 's mostly underground hip-hop fans . My Spotify is like 80 percent dudes . Interesting . Right ? And I think it 's because I 've done so many cyphers and came up cyphering and freestyling . Your cyphers are very tight and impressive and it 's always just kind of like , `` Oh , that 's embarrassing '' for everyone else . In the `` Cypher Effect '' video , you step up and look a little mousy for a second , then you open your mouth and it 's like `` Oh okay ! '' I feed off that . That 's how I gained confidence . I had to walk into the room with 20 dudes , and they would all go first and I would go last and the producer would be like `` Yeah , you should close it out . '' And then I was like `` Okay , word , '' like , `` Maybe I can do this . '' `` CVTVLYST '' is the song that hooked me . I always love the nostalgic references to like Disney characters and stuff . Always ! But it does n't come off as corny at all . What 's your writing process like ? Are there certain things that need to be happening for you to write a lot ? Sometimes . `` CVTVLYST '' happened because I was distracting myself a little bit from a pretty unfortunate situation with a guy who kind of broke my trust . So over winter break I was doing everything I could to not think about it , and I just kept writing , and it turned into a six-minute song . But my writing process has changed a lot . I used to just sit there with my earbuds and write until I felt like something was finished . But when I joined my college band the Illaquips , which is where I met Raf ... that 's when I started to freestyle . Because we would freestyle hour-long house show sets , and we were doing a lot more melodic things . I came up as an MC so I was n't ever thinking about singing or melodies or harmonies , and once I started doing that it became a pretty important part of my writing process . Now I sit on the couch with a mic and some headphones with Ty . I used to only write by myself . He 'll put a beat on and I 'll spend 30-45 minutes freestyling melodies , lyrics , concepts , anything . And then I 'll go through the session and pick what I like and I 'll write words to it . I 'll keep things , add harmonies , layer things . I would say at least 70 percent of the project was freestyled in some way . Was there one song that was harder to write on the album or one that you struggled with ? Or maybe a track that took a lot more editing ? Yeah I would say every song for the most part on the project came easy , just because that 's the best stuff that ends up making the project is the stuff that comes easy . The hardest song was `` Fine Things '' because I made that the week that we had to turn the project in because I felt like we were missing something on the project . So I hit Christo , who 's a fantastic producer , and I hit Samurai to make some samples for me , gave Sam some references . He cooked those up quick , like in a day . I sent them to Christo , -LSB- and -RSB- Christo sent me back the beat in a day . And I really only had like two days to write the song . To me it needed to fit a very specific thing , so I did a lot of editing to that song . I freestyled the hook pretty quickly and got that down . But then I got to the verses and was like , `` How do I wan na flow on this without sounding basic , and keep the energy alive , but make it musical like the rest of the project . '' That was probably the hardest one . A lot of reward with that one . `` I feed off that . That 's how I gained confidence . I had to walk into the room with 20 dudes , and they would all go first and then I would go last and the producer would be like ` Yeah , you should close it out . ''' < hr > This is kind of a big question : Are there any other Portland-based artists you 'd like to collaborate with ? I really honestly wan na make a bar-out track with Vursatyl . That 's one of my goals , and we 've talked about it too . So that 's on my checklist . I would love to make some shit with Rasheed -LSB- Jamal -RSB- . I think he 's got an incredible pen and an incredible flow . I think we would sound really good together on a track . I would love to keep making shit with Blossom . She came in here a couple of times during the making of -LSB- If I May . . -RSB- and laid a lot of backgrounds . We even laid some stuff for an album down the line that did n't end up making the mixtape , but it showed me a lot of what Blossom and I could do . I 'd love to work with Myke Bogan . He 's got some incredible ideas and flows and I love the texture of his voice . Cool ! What 's cookin ' on the backburner right now for after the `` Mirrorland '' tour is done ? I need to make some new shit . There 's some stuff we made towards the end of the project that could exist on a shorter project , like an EP , at some point this year . But we have n't been able to flesh it out because we 've been deep in mixtape street runs or preparing for the show , or the holidays . So hopefully while we 're on tour we get some beat packs and I could make some shit . But when I get back I need to make another something else . Hopefully I 'll put out some singles while I 'm on the road . Hopefully . Easier said than done . And I would love to do some more touring this year . It 's good to get that under my belt . I think we 're gon na learn a shit load . Is there anything else you 'd like to talk about ? -LSB- My team and I -RSB- decided we 're not gon na move out of Portland . Ever ? Nah , we 're not leaving . I wanted to talk to you about this , because I also grew up in a suburb of Portland and I 'm still here , working and in that zone where it 's like , `` Should I go or should I just stay ? '' Yeah , it 's an interesting line to walk because it 's very thin . I 'm extremely aware that I 'm from Lake Oswego . I talk about it in every interview . That being said , this is the city that I put on for . And there 's a lot of potential here . There 's a lot of spaces that I can see myself filling . There 's a lot of work I want to do , a lot of things I want to help with , whether that 's just overall societal things or in terms of developing -LSB- the -RSB- music industry culture here . There 's a lot to be said for deciding : If I 'm going to be a hot commodity ... I 'm going to be telling labels `` If you want to meet with me , you need to come to Portland . '' That 's a statement that I think not only is important for just me and what I stand for -- I 'm such a Northwest kid , I could n't live in LA -- i 's also just who I am . I 'm just a loyal person . Dame -LSB- Lillard -RSB- actually instilled a lot of that in me , because he 's very much like , `` I came to Portland , I 'm gon na bring my city a ring . Like , whatever that takes , I 'm not leaving to get a ring . If I get one , it 's gon na be in Portland . '' And that kind of loyalty is something I really look up to and realize is important to me , too . And I realize that it 's an ever-changing place with a lot of its own issues and a lot of its own wonderful aspects , but that 's something that I 'm gon na stick with no matter what it means . I really like that attitude . One of the first times I interviewed Blossom I asked her , `` How do you feel about this pressure to leave Portland once you reach a certain point ? '' And she was like , `` I do n't see why I would need to leave . I can travel . '' She 's like , `` I love Portland . I want to live here . '' Yeah . When we 're working on music , we 're in LA for at least two weeks . And that 's because of all the resources and people ? Yeah , all the producers . There 's a lot of creatives over there , but there 's also a shitload here ! I mean , all the artwork -LSB- for the album -RSB- , a lot of the production , pretty much all the additional instrumentation , background vocals , anything musical that was added to a beat was out of Portland . All the visuals , whether it was Riley Brown or Fenn Paider really going to bat to help execute my creative vision . And , you know , Dame deciding that he wants to pull up to Pioneer Square to shoot -LSB- `` The Thesis '' -RSB- ? These are people who believe in the city and want to make it work , and that to me is exciting . I said to someone in some interview who asked if I feel a pressure to put on for Portland , and I said it 's less of a pressure and more of like a passion . Because it 's exciting to me . I feel like I get to wake up every day and this is my office . I 'm not in LA in a small studio like ` What can I do here ? ' I 'm here looking at all of this . I feel like I can help , and that 's exciting . I 'm excited just hearing you talk about it . 'Cause it is such a hard thing for me to think about like `` Am I really gon na live in my home city , like , for my whole life ? '' Right . That 's fair . Why would I move somewhere else in the US when Portland is kind of like THE place to be right now ? Every time you travel and you come back ... you miss it , and then you like smell the air and you 're like `` Oh I can breathe here . I can drink the water here . '' It 's fresh . And I need that so bad . I feel you . I love coming home to this . I ca n't wait to be in a van for six weeks with three boys . I 'm gon na be in like Nebraska and Illinois , and then come back to Portland and be like -LSB- sigh -RSB- . Exactly . And it helps knowing that other people are also committed to that and not just taking all our talents elsewhere . And that 's what it is . There has to be at least a couple people that are like , `` No , I 'm gon na stay . '' And then more people can make that decision . But nobody 's made that decision yet really except for Dame . We were going back and forth : `` We might need to move to LA this year . What 's that gon na be like ? '' We had a meeting at Kamp Grizzly and that was eye-opening because ... you kind of get this idea in your head that things are n't possible in Portland . You ca n't develop an industry here . Those things only exist down there with those resources . And we went to Kamp Grizzly , which is just a dope creative agency here . We were just seeing their office and meeting them and being like , `` Oh , those things exist here . '' People do n't know about them because they are n't necessarily feeding Portland . They 're still working with New York and LA , but they 're here and you can do that . And we left there and we were like `` Fuck that . We should just be here . That 's way sicker and way easier . '' And immediately , we just got so much happier . I 'm glad y\u2019 all came to that conclusion . And also you have this view , which is frickin ' tight , to remind you of that . Yeah , it 's the best spot . In `` Buzzer , '' I said `` Floor9 views for the skyline . '' Like when you 're working ... and you 're looking at this , especially at night , you can see everything . And that 's just like so fuckin ' sick . It 's so inspiring . And Ty and I have a lot of our meetings downtown because we like to be inside of it when we 're thinking about it . But it 's nice to come back here and work and be slightly removed but be able to stay on it . Yeah , and also to be a part of Portland 's rise . 'Cause like I feel like we 're the next spot almost . Yeah . Yeah . The time is coming . It 's coming . And some people wo n't be here to see it . I have this like horror idea in my head of like leaving and moving somewhere -- And it happens without you . Yeah . I do n't wan na come back and be like , `` Huh ? '' Yeah , that 's definitely a fear . 'Cause I feel like I 've already invested so much time and energy here , I do n't want to just leave it to somebody else . And you see it paying off ! Like , I can see shit growing here .", "url": "https://www.portlandmercury.com/music/2020/01/16/27818448/rap-goddess-wynne-talks-new-album-rose-city-loyalty-and-touring-with-earthgang", "kws": ["EarthGang", "music", "underground^^hip-hop^^fans", "lyrics", "mixtape^^street^^runs", "tour", "Wynne", "Yo", "melodic^^things", "background^^vocals", "hype^^man^^extraordinaire", "downtown^^Hollywood", "melodies", "Holy^^shit", "harmonies", "LA", "Rose", "Blossom", "J.I.D.", "Rose^^City"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 0.9697056412696838}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Music": 0.9697056412696838}, "third_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Music_Other": 0.9697056412696838}}}

The 47-year-old reality star -- who shares daughters Gia , 19 , Gabriella , 16 , Milania , 15 , and Audriana , 11 , with Joe -- made the revelation about her kids after getting into a verbal disagreement with Joe , who , at the time , was living in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement while he fought to appeal a judge 's deportation order . Joe , 49 , was calling to wish Teresa a Happy Mother 's Day , but instead began bickering with her over a previous necklace he had given her with her name on it . According to Joe , the piece of jewelry was similar to the silver one Teresa 's daughters had just gifted her for Mother 's Day . Problem was , Teresa never remembered getting Joe 's gift , and combated his insistence otherwise . `` You did n't -LSB- buy me a necklace with my name on it -RSB- , '' Teresa said . `` No . I would remember . '' `` Years ago , '' Joe said . `` You do n't remember anything . I bought you a lot of things . ... My wife 's brain is going mush ! '' Though Teresa insisted he had n't , her girls quickly came to their dad 's defense . `` He 's saying he did , so he did , '' Milania told her mom . `` You do n't remember anything , so you do n't ! You have such a bad memory . '' The incident left Teresa feeling hurt . `` Today started out , beautiful day with my daughters but Joe always gets the girls to go against me , '' she told audiences . `` It hurts me tremendously . There should be no sides taken ! '' `` My kids , they take Joe 's side , '' she complained to pal Dolores Catania later . `` Here I am busting my ass doing everything and then it 's like , he 's the greatest thing that walked the earth ! '' It 's not the first time Teresa has groaned about feeling as if her daughters do n't have her side . Earlier this season , after two similarly tense phone calls between her and Joe , Teresa expressed her disappointment that her daughters did n't have her back . `` Normally I would n't talk about Joe in front of the girls but sometimes I do snap at him because he just gets me at that point , '' Teresa said in a previous episode . Later , Gia explained why she might have a little more compassion for her dad , saying that she was well aware of the difficult living conditions he had in the ICE facility . `` Honestly , they 're good at aggravating each other , '' Gia told audiences , of her parents . `` But when he lashes out , I just wish my mom would keep quiet , just because he 's fighting for his life in there . '' Indeed , Joe 's fight has been difficult on him . The Giuidce patriarch has been living apart from Teresa and his children since he reported to prison for mail , wire and bankruptcy fraud in March 2016 . He had hoped to go home but was deported , having never obtained American citizenship after moving to the U.S. as a young child . Two deportation appeals have been denied so far . A third is still pending . `` Am I okay ? I 'm going on 38 months in this crap ! '' he said , during a call to Teresa that aired in a November RHONJ episode . `` They want to separate us now , we 're married 20 years . We got four kids , alright ? They want to destroy four kids . I 'm here now and I 'm getting deported and that 's all there is to it . It 's over . '' `` I do n't see anybody in here walking out . They 're all getting deported , '' Joe added . `` I 'm over it . I 'd rather be out and see you while I can than be sitting in this friggin ' junk hole . At this point , I do n't care where the hell I go . ... I 'm going to fight it out a little while later , and then I 'm done . That 's it . '' Since then , Joe has been granted a request to live out his final appeal decision in his native Italy . He moved there in October , and was visited by his girls and Teresa in November . The girls went back to see their dad over Christmas . Teresa skipped out on the holiday visit , with PEOPLE announcing exclusively in December that the two had agreed to separate after 20 years of marriage . A source told PEOPLE the pair are n't divorcing just yet , and are instead remaining focused on their children during their time apart . Meanwhile , her squabble with Joe aside , Teresa had an emotional Mother 's Day on Wednesday 's RHONJ -- even breaking down into tears at one point after reading the card her daughters had penned for her . '' ` To my spectacular mom ... thank you for everything you do , ' '' Teresa said , reading the card before tearing up . '' ` I 'm so grateful for you in that you always fight through hard times . When you were n't here for Mother 's Day , I felt like you were always right next to me . ' `` `` I love this card , '' Teresa said . `` I love that . You guys are making me ball . You guys are the best ! '' `` Mother 's Day is a difficult day for me since I lost my mom , '' Teresa added . `` She was just the most caring , loving mom ever . '' As for her relationship with her own girls , Catania urged Teresa to give it time . `` I know that Teresa 's very hurt right now . I just hope Teresa knows that at the end of the day , these kids are going to show her all the gratitude , love , and respect in the world , '' Catania said . `` It 's just a rough time for her right now .

Everything , it seems , becomes larger than life . For East Ascension senior wrestler Trent Mahoney , the Louisiana Classic always has been that way . `` I remember coming to this tournament as a little kid and telling my Dad this was the tournament I had to wrestle in , '' Mahoney said . `` To me , it was the biggest tournament and the best . I could n't wait to be one of those guys . Winning it was what I always wanted . I 've won twice and it 's still a big deal . '' The two-day tournament that begins at 3 p.m. Friday at the Lamar Dixon Expo Center in Gonzales . Mahoney earned the meet 's coveted Outstanding Wrestler award as a precocious freshman . Most competitors consider themselves lucky to win the Classic OW award or a weight class once at the Classic . Mahoney enters his final Classic as the top seed at 170 pounds with a 59-0 record that includes 44 pins . Though he idolized the wrestlers watching his father , EAHS head coach Pat Mahoney coach , there was one other key factor -- he believed he could be them . The route to become that guy , the Division II King College signee who has set Louisiana state records for career wins and pins already this season was much like the 6-foot , 170-pounder -- a bit unconventional . `` You know what I like the most about my Dad as a coach ? '' Mahoney stated . `` He has always made it fun for us . Some parents who coach their kids are so hard on them and demand so much . He always wanted to make sure we -LRB- Mahoney along with older brother Patrick Jr. and younger brother Brad -RRB- , which was a good for me . `` As a kid , I got to wrestle all over the city and work with different coaches . It was a great experience . But from the time I was about five or six until I was about 11 , I was pretty bad . I did n't win much , but I had fun . '' That young apprenticeship is just part of Mahoney 's unconventional story . The fact that he started his prep career in the 132-pound weight class and moved on up ladder to now wrestle nearly 40 pounds higher also is a bit unusual . `` The thing about Trent is this -- what he does ... he 's so funky . I understand that his matches can be hard to officiate because of what he does , '' Pat Mahoney said . `` A classic wrestler sets up in a stance and then goes for a shot to score .

After our revelation yesterday that weekly sessions can stave off the menopause , we took a look at other ways that loving feeling can help our health . And our findings bring a whole new meaning to sexual healing . From a longer life and catching fewer bugs to a better night 's kip , you can reap rewards from getting randy . And even solo sessions bring benefits -- as Tyson Fury would agree . The heavyweight told yesterday how he is masturbating SEVEN times a day to reach peak condition for his Deontay Wilder rematch in February . He believes daily rounds help keep his testosterone pumping , admitting : `` If it 's gon na give me an edge , I 'm willing to try it . '' We also told how middle-aged women who have weekly sex sessions are 28 per cent less likely to experience the menopause over the next decade . And even getting frisky once a month meant a 19 per cent reduced risk , according to the University College London study . PhD student Megan Arnot said : `` The findings suggest that if a woman is not having sex , and there is no chance of pregnancy , the body ` chooses ' not to invest in ovulation as it would be pointless . '' The study was prompted after researchers realised married women start the menopause later than single ladies . Here , we fling back the sheets on the many health benefits of sex . Reproductive organs IMPROVES libido : It sounds obvious but the more you do it the better it gets , says Northwestern University in Illinois . For women , having sex raises vaginal lubrication , blood flow and elasticity , which increases sex drive . Strengthens pelvic floor : During orgasm , muscle tone , heart rate , and respiration all increase , and the pelvic floor gets a workout -- helping ward off erectile dysfunction or incontinence . Aids fertility : A female orgasm can boost the chances of conceiving . Experts say when a woman experiences the Big O a minute after her partner ejaculates , she is likely to retain more sperm . If she orgasms before her partner , there is lower sperm retention and less chance of conception . Stops STIs and unwanted pregnancies : Unsurprisingly , going it alone prevents the risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection or getting pregnant . Heart REDUCES chance of death after heart attack : Heart attack survivors who had sex more than once a week were 27 per cent less likely to die during the 22-year study period compared to those who were celibate . The research , published in the American Journal of Medicine , found getting jiggy even once a week , cut deaths by 12 per cent , and less often by eight per cent . Lowers blood pressure : Regular sex can cut blood pressure as effectively as medicines , according to a Georgia State University study . Orgasms cut it by 13 per cent -- and this reduction lasts until the next day . However , curiously , masturbation did not . Body STOPS back pain : Orgasms are ten times more effective than painkillers such as Valium and have ten times the anxiety-reducing effect of it , a study by the University of Munster , Germany , shows . Half of sufferers felt pain lessen after using `` sexual activity as a therapeutic tool '' . Reverses ageing : Romping more often in older age can make you look seven years younger . The effects work better if the sex is `` loving '' , says Dr David Weeks , a neuro-psychologist at Royal Edinburgh Hospital . Avoids prostate cancer : Men who ejaculate 21 times a month are a third less likely to get prostate cancer , Harvard scientists say . This includes `` sexual intercourse , nocturnal emissions and masturbation . '' Mind IMPROVES sleep : An orgasm before bed can help you relax and drop off due to feel-good hormone oxytocin being released . It also helps you have a peaceful night by staying asleep . Sex could be an alternative or additional treatment for insomnia , say scientists at the University of Ottawa in Canada . Raises self-esteem : Casual encounters could heighten your sense of self-worth and life satisfaction . While those without a partner can also get a confidence boost through solo orgasms , according to the study by Cornell University in New York . Eases stress : When women are affectionate with their partners , they report feeling happier and less stressed the next day , says an Arizona State University study . Another report found when rats have sex every day for two weeks , their hippocampus -- the part of the brain that keeps stress under control -- grows . Sexploits so super SUN sexpert Dr Pam Spurr reveals why getting frisky is great for you : `` Do not underestimate the power of sex to benefit your physical health and general well-being . On the physical side , studies have shown those who have an active sex life have better health pretty much across the board . That 's not just for the young ' uns having sex but also for those who continue physical intimacy into their 60s , 70s and beyond . Research shows the medical benefits of sex range from better cardiac health to fewer head colds and many points in between . It also has a powerful effect on your mental and emotional health . During sex , hormones and brain chemicals are produced , including oxytocin , dopamine and serotonin . These give you a feelgood factor . The natural chemicals bring a sense of calm and also help you to bond with your partner . That increased feeling of well-being and intimacy strengthens your relationship . The couple that plays together -LRB- in bed -RRB- stays together ! Even if you 're `` flying solo '' you can expect to gain the health benefits . The release of sexual tension can decrease anxiety and facilitate relaxation . Any way you look at it , sex is natural , it was meant to be , and everyone should take advantage of the benefits . '' Weight AIDS weight loss : 25 minutes of sex burns about 69 calories for women and 100 for men . So sex twice a week for a month burns around 700 calories -- the same as a spinning class . Lowers risk of diabetes : In a number of studies , women who have sex more often showed a greater resistance to type-2 diabetes . Experts from the University of Sydney , Australia , believe this could be down to greater overall health and less weight gain . Immune system PREVENTS infections : Research suggests female masturbation can protect against cervical infections . Orgasms flex the cervix and flush out bad bacteria , according to Joann Ellison Rodgers ' book Sex : A Natural History . Boosts immune system : Students who had sex once or twice a week were more likely to ward off colds and flu . The subjects in the Pennsylvanian study had higher levels of an important illness-fighting substance in their bodies compared to those who did n't get any . Head STOPS migraines : A study of 83 women at Southern Illinois University found that nearly half of those who climaxed reported that their headaches disappeared . When women in the study had orgasms , their pain threshold went up more than 108 per cent and the pain relief lasted up to ten minutes . Lifespan AIDS long life : In a decade-long study of nearly 1,000 middle-aged British men , those who had at least two orgasms a week had half the death rate of those who reported just one a month . For women , frequency has no bearing on longevity -- the sex has to be good . A 25-year North Carolina study published in 1982 noted women who said they enjoyed sex lived longer .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrBJJqA", "title": "The eight most striking details from the Aaron Hernandez series on Netflix", "content": "A much-anticipated docuseries on Aaron Hernandez hit Netflix on Wednesday , and over three episodes it traces his shocking and seemingly incomprehensible downfall . Between the ages of 16 and 27 , the Connecticut native went from being a fun-loving high school star to a well-paid tight end for the Super Bowl-minded Patriots , only to end up committing suicide in prison after being convicted of one Boston-area murder and heavily implicated in two others . Members of Hernandez 's family declined to participate in the series , the executive producers of which are a pair of sportswriters , Dan Wetzel and Kevin Armstrong , who appear frequently in the episodes to recount events . Hernandez can be heard speaking with a number of people close to him , including his mother and his fiancee , in phone conversations recorded while he was in a Bristol County -LRB- Mass. -RRB- jail . In addition , the series features commentary from childhood friends , law enforcement and prison officials , defense attorneys , journalists and Patriots teammates . AD Here are the eight most striking details that emerged from `` Killer Inside : The Mind of Aaron Hernandez . '' His high school quarterback said they were in a sexual relationship As with many other aspects of the series , those who followed Hernandez 's saga closely or who happened to catch a relevant headline may already have been familiar with the claims made by Dennis SanSoucie , his quarterback and close friend at Bristol Central High . Those unfamiliar with the claims , however , may well be taken aback to hear SanSoucie say they `` experimented '' sexually . `` We continued because we probably enjoyed it . `` Yes , we were in a relationship back then , '' SanSoucie tells the camera , `` but at the time , you do n't look at it like that . '' Elsewhere in the series , SanSoucie says that when news emerged that Hernandez may have had a lover in prison , his father scoffed and declared that there was no way the stud athlete he knew could be gay . SanSoucie said it took him months after that before he `` broke the news '' about himself and Hernandez . AD SanSoucie 's father , Tim , sits next to his son and says at one point that he was `` homophobic '' years ago , just as Hernandez 's father was . `` Aaron was extremely terrified of his father finding out , '' Dennis SanSoucie adds . `` I mean , Mr. Hernandez was well known as a man 's man , a father that slapped the -LSB- gay slur -RSB- right out of you . '' While the series is understandably incapable of fully explaining what drove Hernandez to forfeit his lucrative athletic career in favor of the criminality that eventually led to at least one homicide , `` Killer Inside '' posits at several points that his discomfort with his sexual inclinations , or at least the way they might be viewed by others , manifested itself in angry and occasionally violent outbursts . Other potential factors , such as his brain being posthumously discovered with a stunningly advanced case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy -LRB- CTE -RRB- , as well as his father 's abrupt death when he was 16 , are also explored . Yet the possibility that Hernandez was homosexual or bisexual is consistently raised in the series , including by former Patriots offensive lineman Ryan O'Callaghan , who came out as gay after his NFL career ended in 2011 . AD O'Callaghan appreciated the Patriots culture , pointing out that the team 's focus on winning and mandate to avoid any and all distractions made life easier for him as someone in the closet . He also suggested that Hernandez was extremely concerned about deterring any suspicion regarding his sexuality . `` I think the whole story about Aaron is really unfortunate because you do n't know what drove him to do these things , '' the former offensive lineman declares . `` You know , if he was able to be himself and have some of these negative things not in his life , what kind of difference would that have made ? '' The series also notes that Hernandez 's older brother , DJ Hernandez , wrote in a book that there was a time when Aaron , inspired by female cousins , wanted to become a cheerleader . Their father ended that quickly , DJ claimed . AD He grew up in such a pro-University of Connecticut family , even their dog was named UConn The Hernandez household was all about the Huskies -- for as long as the patriarch , Dennis Hernandez , was alive and providing leadership and stability for young Aaron . The father , known in their Bristol neighborhood as `` The King , '' played at U-Conn . and DJ was a quarterback there who would soon be joined by his star tight end of a sibling . Everything changed , according to several interviewees in the series , after Dennis Hernandez unexpectedly died in 2006 while undergoing hernia surgery . `` Once his father passed , '' the sheriff in charge of the Bristol jail says , '' -LSB- Hernandez -RSB- basically lost the ballast that kept him on course . '' A childhood friend and football teammate , Steven Ziogas , tells us Dennis Hernandez was `` that rock , someone who can set that foundation of values to make sure you 're gon na be a good man , a good father and a good member of the community . '' With his death , Ziogas says , `` Now that 's all gone . '' AD Dennis Hernandez was n't always a positive role model , though , according to `` Killer Inside . '' DJ Hernandez is seen saying their father had issues with alcohol , and `` if it was n't a good day , you felt it . '' In a phone call to Tanya Singleton , a cousin with whom he was very close , Hernandez describes his father as a good man who possessed a wild side . He also says his father 's relationship was his mother was destructive , suggesting that the elder Hernandez put her `` through hell . '' Still , Hernandez and his dad are described as very close by another childhood friend , Kristen St. John . She says that she thought at the time of the father 's death , `` This is not good . Aaron is not gon na take this well at all . '' St. John described the period around Dennis Hernandez 's death as `` the turning point of everything in Aaron 's life . '' AD Hernandez , stunning his family , decided to jilt U-Conn . and his home state altogether not long after , to play football at the University of Florida , where Coach Urban Meyer had built a powerhouse program . He told his mother in a phone call from prison , `` You f -- d my whole life up . '' If Hernandez was well aware that his father could be cruel to his mother , he hardly let her off the hook for his issues . In one call from jail , he tells her , `` I do n't put you down , and you f -- d my whole life up . '' When she protests , he exclaims , `` You did ! But I forgave you , and it 's over with . '' It was n't quite over in that exchange . Hernandez went on to exclaim to his mother , `` I was the happiest f ----- g little kid in the world , and you f -- d me up . And I just lost my father , and I had to go to college . And I had nobody . AD `` What the f -- did you think I was gon na do , become a perfect angel ? '' Hernandez is then heard telling is mother , `` Oh my god , if I was with you right now , I would have probably punched the -LSB- expletive -RSB- out of you . You bring me to this level . '' In another phone conversation between the two , he explains that he does n't feel he can confide in her , saying , `` You 're going to die without ever even knowing your son . That 's the craziest thing about it . '' He asked after the 2013 season to be traded away from New England The request came shortly after Hernandez allegedly shot Alexander Bradley , a partner in crime both literally and figuratively , in the face . It was also several months after the double-murder for which he eventually went on trial , and Hernandez was said to be in a very high state of anxiety , if not outright paranoia . AD Patriots Coach Bill Belichick turned down the request even though Hernandez said he had some worries about his family 's safety , but the team did suggest some extra security measures and helped Hernandez find an apartment . Tim San Soucie expresses annoyance in the series at the NFL for helping Hernandez find other living arrangements that he found to be secretive in some measure . `` Now the guy 's got a house , why does he need another apartment ? '' SanSoucie says . `` And why are you helping him get it ? Did you think he was gon na be painting Bob Ross pictures over there ? '' Testimony from Robert Kraft helped convince jurors of his guilt During Hernandez 's trial for the murder of Odin Lloyd , the boyfriend of his fiancee 's sister , the Patriots ' owner took the stand to divulge what he discussed with the tight end shortly after Hernandez was connected to Lloyd 's death . `` I understood there was an incident that had transpired , and I wanted to know whether he was involved , and if he was -- any player that comes into our team I consider part of our extended family , and I wanted to get him help , '' Kraft said of Hernandez . `` He said he was not involved , that he was innocent , and that he hoped that the time of the murder incident came out , because I believe he said he was in a club . '' Hernandez 's comments , as relayed by Kraft , suggested that the tight end already had some idea of the time of the murder , and at least a few jurors took note . There was also a mountain of other evidence that at the very least placed Hernandez at the scene of the crime , including a marijuana-filled blunt that was linked to his DNA . He told a former NFL teammate that all players needed were `` weed and Toradol '' `` That 's all you need , baby ! '' Hernandez told former Florida teammate Mike Pouncey , then with the Dolphins , at the time of their recorded phone exchange . `` I 'm telling you , bro , they 're canceling all the Toradols , '' Pouncey replies , referring to a painkiller notoriously overprescribed for years by NFL teams . `` They do n't want to give you no Toradol shots no more . '' `` If players want it , man , '' Hernandez says , `` they 're getting that . '' At another point in the series , Jenkins is heard on a phone call telling her fiance , `` All those drugs they shoot you guys up with , and tell you to go out there and play . ` Play through your pain . Go ! Go ! ''' `` You know what 's crazy ? '' Hernandez replies . `` They banned that -LSB- expletive -RSB- from the league , saying you only could take it if you have a serious injury or something . ... Guess who they gave that -LSB- expletive -RSB- to every -LSB- expletive -RSB- game ? Me . '' Hernandez also tells Jenkins in the series , `` My body 's so f -- d up , honestly . Just from football , you know what I mean ? '' After his suicide , his defense attorney thought , `` We 've got ta get that brain . '' Hernandez hanged himself in his prison cell in 2017 , despite being acquitted four days earlier for the murders of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado , two strangers whom Massachusetts prosecutors argued were shot in a 2012 drive-by after a brief altercation with the Patriots player at a Boston club . The defense attorney , Jose Baez , said a day after the suicide that Hernandez 's family would donate the tight end 's brain for study by Boston University researchers . That prompted assistant district attorney Patrick Haggan to dismiss it in his mind as `` just a publicity stunt of some sort , '' he says in the series , but he admits he `` could not have been more wrong when I saw the results of his CTE . '' Boston University 's Ann McKee is seen saying at a news conference that Hernandez had unusually extensive deterioration in his frontal lobes , which are critical for judgment and decision-making . `` This would be the first case we 've ever seen , '' she said at the time , `` of that kind of damage in such a young individual . '' Former Patriots teammate and fellow tight end Jermaine Wiggins makes it clear that he 's not ready to use CTE to explain away Hernandez 's actions , calling that line of reasoning `` a cop-out . '' He jokingly asked his agent for a marketing deal with Smith & Wesson Hernandez 's agent , Brian Murphy , is heard joking with the ex-player , now in jail , `` I 'm still trying to get you marketing deals . It 's not so easy , man . '' As Hernandez laughs , Murphy goes on : `` I talked to Nike the other day . They said it was really hard to put the Nike swooshes on orange jumpsuits . '' `` Hey can you get me a Smith & Wesson deal ? '' Hernandez asks . He cracks up as Murphy replies , `` No , I can not get you a Smith & Wesson deal , you -LSB- expletive -RSB- . '' A brain study examined 111 former NFL players . Only one did n't have CTE .", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/01/15/aaron-hernandez-netflix-documentary/", "kws": ["Aaron^^Hernandez", "DJ^^Hernandez", "AD^^Dennis^^Hernandez", "AD^^Hernandez", "Mr.^^Hernandez", "Netflix", "Brian^^Murphy", "star", "episodes", "Alexander^^Bradley", "Kevin^^Armstrong", "Jose^^Baez", "Bob^^Ross", "Jermaine^^Wiggins", "Jenkins", "Kristen^^St.^^John", "Dan^^Wetzel", "man", "Odin^^Lloyd", "Tanya^^Singleton"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"CrimePublicsafety": 0.8675247430801392, "Sports": 0.6811449527740479}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Other": 0.6811449527740479, "CrimePublicsafety_Other": 0.8675247430801392}}}
0.0	{"docid": "0NrBPSSv", "title": "The reality of assisted suicide : `` I took my dad to die ''", "content": "My stomach swirled with nerves as I clutched my plastic bag stuffed with toiletries and removed my shoes , preparing for airport security . I was with my family -- my mum , dad and older brother Edward -- and we were surrounded by groups seemingly just like us : it was November and everyone was jetting off for some much-needed winter sun . But their excited chatter washed over me as I tried to swallow back my tears . I was so afraid my crumbling emotions would give us away . Even once we were through security -- meandering around shelves of duty-free Toblerone -- the fear we 'd be stopped coursed through me . I knew that to anyone watching , we must have looked just like the thousands of other passengers , but we knew the truth : while the four of us would be flying out , only three would return . When I was little , Dad and I would build dens out of logs and climb trees together . He worked on an army base and would bring home thick ropes that we would clamber up . He was strong and stoic -- I could n't imagine anyone , or anything , ever hurting him . But then , in 2008 , when I was 13 , Dad was diagnosed with Huntington 's disease . It 's a genetic condition that causes cells in the brain to slowly degenerate and , as members of his family had had it , Dad suspected he did too . The doctors confirmed his worst fears and gave him a prognosis : he had just 10 years to live . We were n't a family who spoke openly about our emotions , and Dad did n't want Edward or I to know about his diagnosis , but Mum insisted . She sat us on the sofa in the living room , the front door slamming as Dad left to take our dog for a walk , and delivered the news . I felt numb , and when Dad returned , we did n't talk about it . He did n't want to . That night though , in my room , I scanned the symptoms online . Tears dripped onto my keyboard as I scrolled : falling , choking , mood swings . He had n't shown any of these signs yet . He was just Dad . It was like reading a list of horrendous moments from our future , knowing there was nothing we could do to stop them . Every article said the same thing : there is no cure . Over the years , we became helpless bystanders as Dad succumbed to each symptom : the first time he choked on his dinner , Edward and I were paralysed with shock , and soon he started stumbling as he walked down the stairs . His illness created a silent unity between the four of us , but Huntington 's also caused Dad 's moods to darken , and he 'd often be angry . We 'd tiptoe around him , for fear of an outburst , telling ourselves that this was n't the real Dad , but Huntington 's slowly eroding his true self . Birthdays were no longer celebrations , but reminders that I had another year less with him . So when my friends began moving away for university , I knew I would n't join them . Instead , I got a job as an administrator at a local company . Dad knew his death was likely to be a painful one , that he was going to end up losing control of his body and mind altogether . In 2017 , he began threatening suicide . It was either that , he told us , or Dignitas -- a centre in Switzerland where severely and terminally ill people can go to end their lives under the guidance of professional staff . Assisted suicide is illegal in the UK , but it was what Dad wanted , and he began to bring it up regularly . We would brush him off and say he was being silly . There was a tug of war between his yearning to die on his own terms , and us wanting him to live as long as possible . But then , one Friday in April , he changed our minds for us . An impossible choice I was brushing my teeth with my boyfriend , Zak , when I noticed the pills . Dad often took tablets , so I did n't think anything of the empty packet of painkillers on the edge of the sink . I went to bed , but was woken at 3am by Mum banging on the door . Dad had taken an overdose . Terrified , I ran to find him . He was in bed and did n't want to be saved . He begged us not to call an ambulance and , instead , to let him die . Eventually , he relented . In hospital , every so often , he 'd let his eyelids settle and say , `` I 'm going now , '' as if willing himself to die . I was torn : he desperately wanted to end it , but I was so relieved he 'd lived . After that night , Dad 's symptoms meant he could no longer look after himself and , as a family , we found it too difficult to care for him full-time . So he moved into a care home during the week , spending weekends at our house . I 'd do what I could to comfort him -- brushing his teeth , pulling on his socks and delivering his meals on my lunch breaks . He ate soft foods he would n't choke on , like rice pudding . And he 'd only ever drink cold tea -- hot water burned his mouth . On weekends , I 'd take Dad out for the day : he loved sitting in the passenger seat as I drove us to McDonald 's . He 'd order a Big Mac , a McFlurry and a milkshake , and I 'd sit across the Formica table , taking pictures as he wolfed the lot . Though the parent/child dynamic had reversed , I 'd occasionally see flickers of the old Dad . On Sunday nights , he 'd beg to stay with us at home , insisting he could cope . But erratic behaviour was never far away : once , Mum was returning him to care when he leapt from the car into a main road . Before he went into care , I 'd thought Dad was being so selfish -- I could n't understand his desperation to die when he had us to live for . But after his overdose , I slowly began to realise we were the selfish ones . Despite this , when Mum told me that summer that she 'd agreed Dad could go to Dignitas , I was angry : why was n't our care enough for him ? But the more I thought about it , the more I understood Dignitas to be Dad 's saviour . He had to go while he could still consent and take the lethal drug himself . Otherwise , he risked being trapped in his ailing body until death came naturally , a thought that was impossible for him -- and us -- to bear . He hated being in care , and I could n't stand the idea of watching him deteriorate . I decided that I wanted to be by his side in Switzerland . `` I 'd pleaded with him for one more Christmas , but he was adamant '' Dad booked his death at Dignitas for the 30th November 2017 , aged 59 . I 'd pleaded with him for one more Christmas , but he was adamant . The night he booked it , Dad was elated and wanted to celebrate , but I felt sick . I plastered a congratulatory smile onto my face as Dad -- who never drank alcohol -- savoured a glass of red wine . It 'd been a long process . To be accepted at Dignitas , he 'd had to become a member , send Dignitas a formal request and a medical file , pay # 9,500 for the process , then undergo multiple consultations there . Having control over his death gave Dad a new lease of life , but we were sworn to secrecy for fear of prosecution . Even though assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland , it 's illegal to help someone to go if you 're a UK citizen . We told the care home we were going on holiday , and Dad even worried about telling his brother , a policeman . We booked Dad a return flight to avoid suspicion . I also quietly hoped it could be a way out , if he changed his mind . As the date drew nearer , I focused on making it through each day and hiding my tears from him . He 'd say to me , `` You do n't mind , do you , Lottie ? '' `` Dad , it 's your life , do what 's right for you , '' I 'd reply . It stung , but I meant it : I did n't want him to suffer . The fact his death was premeditated meant we had time to say everything we wanted to . My brother and I each wrote him a letter . As I described how proud I was of him , that he was my hero and always would be , I sobbed so hard the ink ran , and the paper soaked with tears . For our last family day out , the four of us went to Bournemouth beach . I pushed Dad along the pier in his wheelchair as he laughed , watching our dog , Alfie , splash in the waves . We sat on the promenade eating fish and chips , bathed in the late afternoon autumn light . We planned to spend a few days in Zurich before Dad 's death . Weirdly , once we made it through the airport , and the fear of being caught there , the week was fun . We behaved like normal tourists , visiting glassy lakes and drinking at cottage-like pubs . The security of death had made Dad carefree . He walked more than he had in years , released from the fear of falling , and the night before we went to Dignitas , he finished everyone 's leftover desserts , swallowing spoonfuls of cream and flaky pastry . On the morning of his appointment , I blinked awake , and for two precious seconds I forgot what was about to happen . In the car , Dad gave his wedding ring to me and his watch to Edward . The band was loose around my finger , so I slid it onto my bracelet . '' ' I must ask you again : do you want to die today ? ' , said the doctor . ` Yes , ' Dad replied . ` I 'm positive . ' '' Dignitas 's blue building morphed into view , looking more like an industrial unit than a medical facility . Edward went to wait in a caf\u00e9 -- he has sensory processing sensitivity , meaning he feels more deeply than others , and would have been too overwhelmed . Meanwhile , Mum , Dad and I went in . It was n't like a hospital : there were no corridors or strip lights , and we did n't see another patient . Dad 's room was like a fancy apartment , painted white , with a bed , kitchenette and a radio playing classical music . We sat down and the doctor said : `` Keith , I must ask you again : do you want to die today ? '' `` Yes , '' Dad replied . `` I 'm positive . '' The sliver of hope I 'd clung to melted like an ice cube -- my dad wanted to die more than he wanted to live . Dad 's head rested on a bright red pillow and the foot of the bed was lined with candles . He drank the prescribed medication voluntarily through a straw , filming himself as evidence in case the police thought we 'd forced him . My stomach lurched ; there was no going back . Death does n't come straight away , so as the medicine took hold , the world was still . Dad lived for another two hours , with Mum and I by his side . The intervals between his breaths got longer . I kept glancing at the clock and looking back to Dad 's chest , feeling relief every time it rose and fell , then berating myself for holding on to hope . His last breath was a wisp -- a quiet , dignified end . Mum and I gripped each other tightly as we sobbed . When it was time to go , I felt glued to the spot ; I could n't bear to leave Dad alone . On the flight home , people stared at us , wondering what could possibly be so wrong . Minutes felt like hours as we waited for take-off in silence . My mind rushed back to Dad 's room . Then I glanced at his empty seat . I looked out of the window and thought , `` I wish I knew where you were . '' Life after Dignitas Back home , I was engulfed by a wave of devastation and did n't leave the house for days , while a steady stream of flowers and family flooded the living room . When I went to the care home to clear out Dad 's things , the staff 's jaws dropped as I told them why he would n't be returning . In December , Mum went back to Dignitas to collect Dad 's ashes and at the end of January , we held a funeral and celebration of his life . Many of the 100 guests were blindsided by how Dad died , so I read a passage he wrote explaining his decision . I rattled through the words , suppressing the lump in my throat : `` People might not agree , but this is my life and I want control over my death . '' We scattered Dad 's ashes at a tree we 'd planted for him on Hungerford Common , five minutes from our house . A few people disagreed with Dad 's choice and a couple of my friends struggled to understand why he wanted to die , but at the time of Dad 's death , he was close to needing a feeding tube . In that situation , who would rather watch their loved one suffer over having a dignified , pain-free death at the time they choose ? Campaigning to change the law is our last act of love for Dad . We want terminally ill people in the UK to be able to choose when they end their lives and we promised him we would put that into action . With the help of Dignity In Dying , Mum set up a support group for other families like ours , and in July we went to parliament to hear MPs debate the issue . The message seemed to pierce through -- ultimately everyone wants the best for the people they love . After work , I sometimes find myself still heading for the care home , before a jolt of realisation alters my course . If I 'm having a bad day , I 'll go and sit under the tree we planted for Dad and talk to him . Right now , the trunk is thin , but in years to come , I imagine looking up at its sprawling branches and knowing Dad is there with me . What happened next ... `` As well as losing Dad , I also had to deal with the fear that I had inherited the faulty gene that causes Huntington 's . I could n't be tested until I was 18 , and I had the test in early 2019 because the fear had begun to stop me living : I could n't see the point of saving for a house deposit and was terrified about passing it on to my future children . The test came back negative . Now I can get on with my life .

It is snaking through the game methodically , like lava flowing from a fissure , all the while claiming what the industry widely regarded as Good Baseball Men . Alex Cora is the latest to go away , perhaps forever given his integral role in the Astros ' scheme and his likely two-time offender status as manager of the Boston Red Sox , who tossed him aside Tuesday night . Now , rookie New York Mets manager Carlos Beltran must withstand whatever fallout his role in the scheme will bring . And whether he survives will be determined not by Major League Baseball 's judicial wing , but rather how wide this fissure in the game opens . From NFL plays to college sports scores , all the top sports news you need to know every day . Beltran was an Astros player in 2017 , the only one identified by name in a nine-page MLB report that resulted in the firing of his manager A.J. Hinch . In the final season of a likely Hall of Fame playing career , Beltran , MLB noted , was at the forefront of a group of players who early in that season `` discussed that the team could improve on decoding opposing teams ' signs and communicating the signs to the batter . Cora arranged for a video room technician to install a monitor displaying the center field camera feed immediately outside of the Astros ' dugout . '' Shortly thereafter , the infamous camera-monitor-trash can system was hatched , and we all know what happened next : The Astros won 101 games and their first World Series title . Along the way , they conquered the Red Sox in the American League Division Series and the New York Yankees in a stirring seven-game AL Championship Series . Yankees reliever Dellin Betances pitched in Game 3 and Game 6 , giving up a sacrifice fly in the latter to Evan Gattis , captured on video in a regular season game as a card-carrying member of the Trash Can Hitters ' Club . In the ALDS , Boston starter Rick Porcello pitched the ninth inning of a Game 1 blowout at Minute Maid Park -- a game in which the Astros ambushed 308-strikeout man Chris Sale for three home runs -- and started Game 4 at Fenway Park . Now , Betances and Porcello are Mets , and suddenly in the position of taking orders from a 42-year-old first-time manager who in the recent past devised a rules-shattering system designed to beat them . Awkward ? Well , that 's just a function of the modern game , where managerial jobs are viewed as no-experience-necessary gigs , so long as you follow the front office 's analytical playbook to the very last out . Heck , Beltran nearly went from player to manager in just a few weeks , interviewing with those same Yankees for their opening after they let Joe Girardi go -- for losing to Beltran 's cheating Astros in the ALCS . Nowadays , the manager 's role is , essentially , to serve as the public-facing voice of the franchise and also to keep the clubhouse bonded and players on message throughout a tumultuous seven-month trial by fire . Beltran 's ability to serve both those roles seems compromised . He 's already lost ground in the media game , with some dodgy answers to the New York Post about his role in Houston now bearing greater scrutiny . His mere presence will , for some fans and media , be hard to unpack from his role in the Astros ' scheme . But managers have lied -- or withheld the truth -- to reporters for time eternal . It is the clubhouse where Beltran faces a unique challenge . Why ? Players around the game are angry about the cheating scandals -- including Beltran 's No. 3 starter . After Cora was dismissed Tuesday night , Marcus Stroman tweeted his delight , noting Cora had criticized his deceptive movements on the mound . `` Very comical in hindsight , '' he noted . This man had the audacity to say that I compete a certain way and people do n't like it . Very comical in hindsight . Lol https://t.co/bpIDWmqzA6 -- Marcus Stroman -LRB- @STR0 -RRB- January 14 , 2020 Texas Rangers pitcher Mike Minor took a shot at Cora as well . Social media also stoked the embers on the simmering Indians-Astros -LRB- or is it merely Trevor Bauer-Astros ? -RRB- kerfuffle . When spring training camps open in less than a month , we 'll learn just how deep the anger over this scandal runs among the player population . Beltran , meanwhile , will hold his first clubhouse meeting presiding over a group with myriad connections to it . There 's Betances and Porcello , playoff opponents , as well as closer Edwin Diaz , who pitched in eight games at Minute Maid Park as a Seattle Mariner from 2017-2018 , the lifespan of the scandal . Outfielder Jake Marisnick was Beltran 's 2017 teammate , playing in 106 games , though none in the postseason -LRB- same for J.D. Davis , who played in 24 games -RRB- . In theory , Beltran can stand before this group and acknowledge his wrongdoing . Beltran was a Hall of Fame caliber player who also was skilled in the dark art of `` ethical '' sign-stealing . He can make the case that in trying to take that extra inch , he and his Houston teammates eventually wandered a mile , far afoul of baseball 's unwritten and written rules , alike . His players may accept that , too . Yet the great unknown is just how far this scandal is going . Suspicions have followed several teams for years ; the Dodgers have been fingered by the Mets and Brewers each of the past two seasons . The Red Sox and Yankees snitched on one another in 2017 , resulting in fines and the revelation of Apple Watch usage -LRB- Red Sox -RRB- and an unfounded accusation of a YES network camera that doubled as a sign decoder . Most espionage secrets are taken to the grave -- or a mumbled conversation in the players ' lounge -- but after former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers blew the lid off his old clubs ' bad habits , the bar has been reset . Will further cries of inequity from scorned opponents or fans result in players blowing the whistle -- publicly or anonymously -- on their old teams ? Should others fall like Cora and Hinch , the optics of Beltran leading the Mets may worsen . Beltran is clear of MLB 's discipline czars , his 2017 player status sparing him any punishment . Perhaps he must square up with Mets management in the event he 's misled them in the weeks since the scandal broke . And one month from now , in Port St. Lucie , he 'll face his full squad for the first time , no longer their peer as a player , but rather as a manager connected to the game 's scourge of the moment . For now , it seems he can withstand the heat . Yet he - nor anyone in the game - can not control where it goes from here .

I 'm Dame Brian Moylan , president and founder of the Real Housewives Institute , filling in for my intern-for-life Molly `` Milly Fotzpatrick '' Fitzpatrick while she 's away on vacation . -RRB- It 's when the fertility clinic calls Melissa and Joe to give them the results of the tests they took a few episodes back . Because she is a Real Housewife , she is physically incapable of talking on the phone unless it 's on speaker , so the receptionist just has to tell everyone the fertility news , including Melissa 's two young sons , who are sitting on the floor of her palatial `` great room '' trying to play Fortnight in peace . `` Usually we see about 15 million sperm per milliliter , '' the nurse says on the phone , `` but when we put Joe 's sample under the microscope , we only saw three sperm swimming . '' Three . Three ! Oh , stop . Oh , hold on . Let me catch my breath . Oh , I think I just peed a little from laughing too hard . Three . Only three . I mean , Carl from Summer House has three balls , but Joe Gorga has the lowest sperm count on all of Bravo . This would n't be so delicious if Joe was n't always talking about how he has to have sex 90 times a day and that if he does n't `` get the poison out '' of his system by rutting with his wife at every opportunity , it will kill him . But this guy , the same one who is on `` growth hormones '' for `` bone and joint health '' -LRB- a wink as big as the fountain at the King of Prussia Mall -RRB- , has killed all of his sperm . And to make it worse , Melissa is , like , super-duper fertile . Joe , who needs to be the king of his castle , is walking around with a ballsack full of dead fish and Melissa is able to just pop out babies like University of Phoenix hands out degrees . Margaret is having a Mother 's Day brunch for all of the cast and their mothers in her backyard and it 's going to feature drag performances , because nothing says motherhood like men dressed as women . -LRB- For the record , all of these drag queens likely have more working sperm than Joe Gorga . -RRB- Before the event can even start , Jackie ruins it by calling up Teresa , who is getting a pedicure with Dolores , and invites them to her Hamptons house next week . She tells Dolores , `` Oh , I was going to tell you tomorrow , '' confirming for Teresa that they 're all hanging out with Margaret without her . `` She did n't invite me ? Bitch , '' Teresa spews like a broken percolator . Instead we see her at home having breakfast with her four daughters and engaging in New Jersey 's second-favorite leisure activity -- fighting with your spouse . -LRB- The first is jarts . -RRB- God , can we just fast-forward to the divorce that we all know is coming already ? Over at Margaret 's house , she 's dressed in Frida Kahlo cosplay while the queens Harumy , Digna , Sucia , and Hybiscus strut up the driveway like it 's Ninth Avenue and they 're late to a gig at Flaming Saddles . Margaret has them greet all the women and their mothers as they arrive , and that seems to spoil the surprise , does n't it ? Do n't you want to just have everyone over to brunch and then , as they 're digesting their omelets , just bring out the queens so that everyone can holler and grab their phones and swing their napkins over their heads while they lip-sync ? I feel like this has to be the banjee-est job these drag queens have ever had . They have to greet everyone in the driveway , walk across the `` before '' picture in a Scotts Lawn Care ad to the back , and then sit them at a table that looks like it was pilfered from a closed-down princess-themed ice-cream parlor . However , the best part of that whole walk is when the drag queens have to escort the mothers past the landlocked boat on the trailer in Margaret 's side yard . I mean , could n't she bring them through the house or something to avoid that unsightly mess ? Despite that , brunch is going pretty well . All of the women and their mothers are telling stories about what they were like growing up , and Jackie tells a story about how she was living with a guy whom she did n't want to marry and he bought an engagement ring . Jackie told her mother to give this guy $ 15K for the ring , and then when he was ready to propose she would sell him the ring back . However , Jackie told her not to ever sell the guy the ring back . After she tells this story , Jennifer says , `` Wow , she must have had some money growing up . '' This is completely the wrong lesson to learn from this story . The lesson to learn from this story is that Jackie is completely insane . Why would she even bother with any of this ? When she found out the dude had a ring , why not just dump him and have him bring the ring back ? Why go through all of these logistical hoops just so she can , what , continue to date a guy she has no intention of marrying ? This sounds like a plan that Rudy Giuliani would have come up with to get dirt on the Bidens or something . The only real drama at the party is when Margaret talks about Teresa and how she wants her to stop being friends with Danielle to be friends with her . Everyone also thinks that she should have invited Teresa to the party to try to smooth things over . Dolores , correctly , says , `` This is going to be a war . '' Look at Dolores , someone must have given her a Magic 8-Ball for Christmas . Finally we get the drag performance , and one of the queens had to learn the lyrics to Melissa 's -LRB- underrated -RRB- dance hit `` On Display '' because that was the only song that the producers could afford to get clearance for . The rest of the queens are just mouthing `` cantaloupe watermelon '' along to nonsense because Bravo did n't want to spring for the original tracks . Everyone loves it except for Jennifer 's mother , Josephine . When the two talk about the performance later at Jennifer 's house , Josephine says she did n't have any idea what was going on and that these were men dressed up like women . She did n't really like it because it was n't something she was used to . Jennifer explains it all and then uses that to shift the conversation to her brother , who is gay , even though her mother does n't like to talk about it . Now , poor Josephine is going to take a lot of hate on Twitter for what she says next , which is that she supports her son but `` if you have a sick child it 's not like you get rid of it . But why does he have to talk about it so much ? '' Jennifer explains to her mother that it 's not a sickness and that it would help their relationship if she could say , openly , that she is proud of her son and his being open about his sexual orientation . Everyone is going to call her homophobic and , well , her comments do come from a deep-seated place of bias . Josephine even admits that where she is from people do n't talk about this and she does n't know how to process it . Let 's give Josephine a chance to do the right thing before we all pile on her . Both Jennifer and her brother realize that it is not his problem , it 's Josephine 's . Jennifer is also doing her best to support her mother and understand her , but also to push her into doing the right thing . This is what we need to make progress . This is the wind that will fan the flame of righteousness inside of Josephine and get her marching in the Wayne , New Jersey , Pride parade behind a PFLAG banner in 2020 . Telling her how wrong and awful she is is n't going to help anyone . Her family is guiding her in the right direction , let 's just hope she follows them . But this scene is the most I have ever liked Jennifer . Well , this and when she gets the address for Jackie 's Hampton 's house just so she can find out how much it rents for -LRB- $ 50K a month in the summer -RRB- and what it 's worth -LRB- $ 2.7 million -RRB- . Thank you for answering the questions that we want to know and doing the Trulia stalking that everyone at home who does n't have the address wanted to be doing . Jackie 's Hampton 's house is really cute on the inside . It looks like Tory Burch designed a house for her little sister whose family lives in Cleveland . You know that Tory would n't have picked out that front door , though , the one with the oval window with a glass flower design that is the unofficial flag of Long Island -LRB- and not the classy part where the Hamptons are , either -RRB- . As soon as Teresa arrives she says , `` Thank you for inviting me , and thank you for not inviting me , Margaret . '' And we are off on the Teresa venom train . She is thinner-skinned than an onion on Accutane . She 's also so privileged in this group , so insulated by her status as the one OG , that she can just treat people however she wants and not expect any consequences . Sadly there probably wo n't be any , but it does spell a lot of drama for the week ahead .", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/real-housewives-of-new-jersey-recap-season-10-episode-10.html", "kws": ["The^^Real^^Housewives", "Bravo", "episodes", "drama", "Jennifer", "Milly", "Jackie", "sex", "friends", "motherhood", "Joe^^Gorga", "Bitch", "vacation", "Dame^^Brian^^Moylan", "Marge", "Dolores", "Summer^^House", "Joe", "home", "Teresa^^spews"], "text_category": {}}

'' Taimi , Abby and Zoia shouted simultaneously as they stood in the garage-door entryway of a warehouse in Salt Lake City . Look around , you 'll see boxes stacked neatly and taped shut , each one filled with new product that is still wrapped in plastic , and piles of un-made boxes which read , ` YOU GO GIRL . ' On the top flap . From the onset , it looks like a typical warehouse -- however , the items inside will probably spark a conversation you are n't expecting . `` Every month you 'll go , ` I can do this ! ' when your hands are covered in chocolate and you 're crying , '' Taimi Kennerley , said laughing as she clutched one of the small white boxes . Take a closer look at the product and some clever marketing should help bring you up to speed . `` Every period is red , we just thought it was hilarious , '' Taimi said as she pointed to a small red punctuation mark on the box . Taimi , Abby and Zoia are known as The Girls ... the period girls . `` There 's always the initial like , ` We 're the period girls ! ' and there 's always the * gasp * , '' Taimi said . Each white box is a special delivery , coming to you once a month , every month . `` So we put them in these mailers and then take them out , we 've got the box , da da da ! '' Abby said as she pulled a completed and filled box out of a mailer covered in cartoon palm trees . But , unlikely women 's other monthly visitor , these girls are trying to make you feel better . `` Our thing is , ` You 're a crampion ! ''' Taimi said . `` Like you 're a champion of cramps ! We think we 're so funny , '' she laughed . Underneath the #crampion instruction booklet , a white nylon band about five inches wide , four packets of ` hot stuff , ' and a colorful , floral sticker promoting the company . `` So , this is the band , '' Abby said as she opened the first packet . `` There are three pockets in the front and back , then we have this clasp and it 's similar to the clasp you would find on a bra and it has three levels so women can decide how tight they want it , '' she said as she demonstrated how to properly use the band . The band is made of a soft nylon material that provides compression ; a silicon-type strip is secured along the top to prevent slipping . The band is meant to be secured at your natural waist , then the ` hot stuff , ' thin heat pouches , can be added to the pockets to target pain -- Think of it like a hand warmer , but it is thinner -LRB- just 4mm thick -RRB- , gets hotter and lasts longer -LRB- between 6-10 hours -RRB- . The item is so thin , it can be worn under clothing undetected . `` It feels like a warm hug for your uterus , that 's the best description ever , '' Taimi said as the girls laughed . After the ` hot stuff ' loses its heat , they can be thrown away with the garbage . Subscribers will then receive a monthly package , replenishing their heat supply for about ten dollars . The girls admit , even though it 's a natural human function , the topic of menstruation makes many people uneasy . `` It 's a really uncomfortable topic , I think throughout time we 've been taught to be embarrassed of it , '' Abby said . `` In reality , it 's just a part of life . '' `` Our overarching goal is to be able to change the way we talk and think about periods and get rid of that stigma and just allow people to be comfortable and allow women to keep doing all of the amazing things they can do even when they 're on their period , '' Abby continued . However , creating the business did n't happen overnight . For these three women , this is the payout a year in the making . `` When we were putting together our boxes on Friday , I was like , ` I ca n't believe we 're doing this , a year later putting these together , ' It 's been such a long time coming , '' Zoia said . It all started when the three met as strangers , paired together for a project in an entrepreneurship class at Brigham Young University in Provo , Utah . `` We were asked to find a solution to a pain for a specific audience , and we were all passionate about women , '' Abby said . After conducting a series of interviews , they said they realized women wanted a solution to cramp pain . `` We just wanted to find out if heat worked to alleviate cramps because currently , the solution was heating pads you had to plug into a wall , or rice packs , but they 're all stationary type of heat where you ca n't go anywhere with it , '' Zoia said . `` It was a very tedious process where we would like test something , see what the results were , analyze and then change for the next one to see what people said . '' Before they knew it , talking about ` the time of the month , ' turned into a year-round job -- it even broke down the uncomfortable walls surrounding menstruation . `` The more open we were , even men would be like , ` My wife has this problem , ' or , ` My girlfriend has this problem and we want to talk about it , ''' Taimi said . Following many failed prototypes , The Girls Band was born , providing discrete , pressure and heat for pain relief . `` The fact that we get to do something that feels important to people and helps people , '' Taimi said . `` That just makes us cry , I do n't know . '' Ultimately changing the way women view their periods , one little white box at a time . `` We 're the girls and we believe your life should n't stop when your period starts ! Period ! '' The girls said as they shouted their company motto together . Since the project 's inception , The Girls have won three collegiate competitions , totaling almost 45-thousand dollars in prize money -LRB- about half of which has been used to bring the product to market -RRB- . The girls opened sales on their online platform this week and have a patent pending . They said they will graduate from BYU in April and keep their company going -- hopefully , one day giving back to women in need of feminine hygiene products in developing and third world countries .", "url": "https://fox13now.com/2020/01/15/utah-college-students-class-project-turns-to-revolutionary-product-bringing-women-portable-menstrual-cramp-relief/", "kws": ["menstrual^^cramps", "thin^^heat^^pouches", "pads", "product", "menstruation", "clothing", "college^^students", "pain^^relief", "feminine^^hygiene^^products", "compression", "women", "plastic", "rice^^packs", "Utah", "un-made^^boxes", "Provo", "Taimi^^Kennerley", "BYU", "men", "people"], "text_category": {}}

Just like it has for most of the season , the team went through the same exact routine of meetings and practice on Wednesday . The mood in the open locker room was as lively as ever , showing no change from the weeks prior . Music was playing . Emmanuel Sanders was shooting baskets at the hoop over his locker . Players were joking around with each other and Kendrick Bourne was going through his daily routine of customizing his practice gear . On the field , the usual suspects were dancing as calisthenics started . Players went through the same warm-ups and stretching order as they 've had since OTAs . The younger players kept the atmosphere upbeat while the veterans brought out an underlying calm . `` Definitely , you feel it in there , '' Garoppolo said . `` It 's definitely a loose atmosphere , but that 's kind of how it 's been all year . Guys are loose , but they are locked in at the same time . It 's a unique combination . We have the guys that are able to do it . '' Coach Kyle Shanahan believes the challenge posed by the second half of the 49ers ' regular-season schedule mentally prepared his team for the playoffs . He has kept the players ' schedules as similar to the regular season as possible . `` Our players have handled it pretty good all year , '' Shanahan said . `` I know by this background and these helmets next to me there 's a lot more dog and pony show and stuff , but hopefully our players know it 's just Wednesday like it 's been all year and tomorrow will be Thursday . '' Sanders , who has quite a bit of experience in the postseason , noted that he does n't feel any added pressure or stress . `` I do n't feel it ramping up , '' Sanders described . `` It 's crazy . Does n't even -- it just feels like another regular-season game . Like I said , I feel like even in the regular season it was like playoff football . It was so much pressure and us having to perform and trying to get the No. 1 seed that you just kind of get used to it , right ? Every week has been a big week . '' Garoppolo , as usual , shared a few laughs at the podium before getting down to brass tacks when answering questions . He remained unflappable , never showing any signs of nerves or stress . `` It 's no different than any other week , '' Garoppolo said . `` We 're coming out here Wednesday , ready to roll and preparing our ass off . I think guys are locked into the preparation with the game plan going in today . Guys are locked in , they are focused up and we are in a good spot right now .

That same crew will have all the postgame reaction on `` 49ers Postgame Live , '' starting at approximately 5:30 p.m. Packers ' Aaron Rodgers used to dream of helping 49ers win a Super Bowl By Scott Bair January 15 , 2020 3:35 PM Aaron Rodgers is a Northern California kid . The Chico native played at Butte College and Cal before starting an illustrious NFL career with the Green Bay Packers , so he 'll enjoy some hometown support during Sunday 's NFC Championship Game against the 49ers at Levi 's Stadium . Beating the 49ers would vault Rodgers into his second Super Bowl appearance , an ideal scenario after a few years left outside the playoff picture . Even still , this is n't how he originally dreamed it up . As a kid living in 49ers country with grand aspirations , Rodgers thought he 'd be helping his home team . `` I usually dreamed about playing for the 49ers as a kid , '' Rodgers said in his Wednesday press conference . `` Obviously , that thing passed a long time ago . But I do remember some great games over the years between the 49ers and the Packers , including -LSB- one -RSB- in this situation . '' The Packers and 49ers have quite a playoff history . There 's only one NFC Championship Game in their postseason series , a seven-game set all played since 1996 . The 49ers are 3-4 in those playoff meetings , but have beaten Rodgers both times they 've met in the postseason , including the 2013 encounter at Candlestick Park not too far from Rodgers ' hometown . His last time playing in North California did n't go so well . The 49ers smashed Green Bay 37-8 back in Week 12 , after which Rodgers told 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo they 'd meet again .

Coach Kyle Shanahan did not disclose the injury during his pre-practice media availability . Kittle is experiencing `` soreness '' in his ankle that is lingering from the 49ers ' game on Saturday. , according to the team . The initial word is that it is not expected to keep him off the field Sunday when the 49ers face the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game on Sunday at Levi 's Stadium . Kittle is the 49ers ' most-explosive offensive player . He caught 85 passes for 1,053 yards and five touchdowns in the regular season . Kittle missed two games earlier this season with knee and ankle injuries . He had a bone chip in his left ankle , which Shanahan previously described as a piece of bark coming off a tree . Kittle 's knee injury was a popped capsule , according to Shanahan . Kittle caught just three passes for 16 yards in the 49ers ' 27-10 victory over the Minnesota Vikings on Saturday in the divisional round of the NFC playoffs . But Kittle was a huge factor in the run game , as the 49ers gained 186 yards rushing on 47 attempts .

Officials said no .", "content": "A movement to withdraw books with LGBTQ characters from elementary schools in one of the nation 's wealthiest counties suffered a setback Wednesday as officials in Northern Virginia voted to leave in place two books that some parents wanted removed . A few months ago , conservative parents launched a religion-driven campaign to banish LGBTQ literature from elementary school libraries and classrooms in Loudoun County -- with early success . School officials had removed at least five books with LGBTQ themes from elementary schools after parents ' complaints about inappropriate content , said school district spokesman Rob Doolittle . The books -- including `` Hurricane Child , '' which details a romance between two girls , and `` The Pants Project , '' which features a transgender boy -- have been redistributed to middle and high schools in the district , Doolittle said . AD But on Wednesday evening , a three-member subcommittee of the Loudoun County School Board voted 2 to 1 to prevent the removal of `` Prince & Knight '' and `` Heather Has Two Mommies . '' That decision will stand for at least a year . `` It has a homosexual relationship , and I know that some parents do n't agree with that , '' John Beatty , a subcommittee member and one of the few conservatives on the School Board , said at the meeting . His argument failed to persuade his fellow board members to vote in favor of eliminating both books . Charlotte McConnell , a member of the LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Loudoun , welcomed the result but said damage has been done . The previous redistribution of LGBTQ books sends a message to students , she said , that `` there is something wrong with you , something unnatural about who you are , and we 're not going to support you in our schools . '' AD `` Every grade needs access to these books , because we know LGBTQ kids have a higher rate for suicidal ideation , '' McConnell said . `` Books can be a lifeline . '' Ashley Ellis , the Loudoun County Public Schools ' assistant superintendent for instruction , said the district has long allowed parents to critique textbooks and other materials . Ellis said some of the books were limited to higher grades after officials determined , unprompted , that the texts would be better suited for older students . That process of directing books to higher grades is known as `` re-leveling . '' `` We are following our objective process , '' Ellis said , although she acknowledged that `` re-leveling does n't happen regularly . . . . There has definitely been a flurry of appeals -LSB- to remove books -RSB- I had not seen before . '' Over the past several months , Loudoun County parents have lodged more than 60 complaints in emails , at School Board meetings and through a program that allows adults to request the review and removal of books , Doolittle said . Many objections have come from parents affiliated with Parent and Child Loudoun , an advocacy group that urged families to object after Loudoun schools introduced more than 80 LGBTQ-themed books through a `` diverse classroom libraries '' initiative this past fall . AD For Parent and Child Loudoun , the earlier reassigning of some books to higher grades marked the first victory in a larger battle to eliminate LGBTQ themes , sexually explicit language and texts laced with profanities from the school system . On Monday , members of the group gathered in a Leesburg church to denounce LGBTQ texts , saying they contravene Christian teachings and spread lies . `` The diverse books initiative is a disaster , '' Beatty , who attended the meeting , told dozens of assembled parents and teachers . `` I ask your help with reeducation . . . . Please pray for me and for the School Board in this upcoming term . '' Natassia Grover , who co-founded Parent and Child Loudoun , called the redistribution of LGBTQ books `` just a Band-Aid . '' `` These all need to go , '' she said . Experts said the battle roiling Loudoun County , an increasingly diverse suburb where the median household income is roughly $ 140,000 , is playing out across the country . Christopher Finan , the executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship , said a backlash against LGBTQ texts began building several years ago , driven by the legalization of same-sex marriage . In 2018 , more than half of the 11 most commonly challenged and banned books included LGBTQ content , according to the American Library Association . AD Finan said that although LGBTQ books have long drawn complaints , he thinks schools are witnessing an unprecedented increase in the number of removals . `` This is a national problem , and no one is noticing , '' said Finan , whose coalition is drafting a statement to try to raise awareness of the issue . This is not the first time Loudoun County has faced controversy over books : In 2008 , administrators pulled `` And Tango Makes Three '' from libraries after a staffer complained about the book , which describes love between two male penguins . A few weeks later , facing outcry from parents and bloggers , the district reversed itself and restored the text to elementary school shelves , where it remains . Some parents ' opposition to LGBTQ-focused initiatives makes the district something of an outlier in the Washington region . In recent months , Maryland began developing a curriculum that includes lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender history , and Virginia legislators are considering a measure that would enhance protections for transgender students in public schools statewide . AD `` Loudoun , I guess , is changing more slowly than I thought , '' said Melanie Starks , 40 , whose two children attend a county elementary school . `` It just seems so -- just , why are we still debating this ? Like , really ? '' School administrators have broad legal latitude to determine which books are available to different grades , said Eden Heilman , the legal director of the Virginia branch of the American Civil Liberties Union . The First Amendment merely bars school officials from forcing any one viewpoint on their students , she said , and does not prevent them from judging whether class material is age-appropriate . `` Re-leveling is really a gray area , '' Heilman said . As removals take effect , LGBTQ advocates and some educators are coordinating protests and petitioning local officials to take action . This week , Loudoun County Latin teacher Andrea Weiskopf wrote to Schools Superintendent Eric Williams and the School Board demanding that they reconsider restricting students ' access to LGBTQ books . AD `` The school board yielded to the demands of a group whose recommendations are harmful to children , '' Weiskopf wrote . During Monday 's two-hour meeting of Parent and Child Loudoun , speakers denounced LGBTQ books as unsafe , `` leftist propaganda '' and `` moral corruption . '' `` They 've removed everything with a Christian influence . . . and replaced it with smut and porn , '' said Beverley McCauley , a county resident and mother of eight . `` But if we band together and we 're loud enough , they have to listen . '' `` God created Adam and Eve , not Adam and Steve , right ? '' Kay Kale , a co-founder of Parent and Child Loudoun , said at one point , spurring nods and chuckles . On their way out , parents passed a table loaded with LGBTQ books that have been challenged or are soon to be . Each bore a homemade label , typed in black , sans-serif font . AD `` PRINCE & KNIGHT , 2ND GRADE , '' read one . `` Promotes homosexual romance . '' `` HEATHER HAS TWO MOMMIES , '' read another , adding : `` Promotes homosexuality/erases fatherhood . '' At the far end of the table rested several copies of `` Get Out Now : Why You Should Pull Your Child From Public School Before It 's Too Late . '' Several parents stopped to read the back cover . As some parents contemplate pulling their children out of the school system , others are struggling to explain what is taking place inside it . During a recent car ride , Rachel Bracken 's 8-year-old son -- a second-grader in Loudoun County -- posed a question that she found difficult to answer . He wanted to know why people were trying to ban the interesting books , with their big pictures , that he likes to read at home . `` What 's so dangerous ? '' Bracken remembers him saying . `` I do n't understand why they would do that . '' His mother paused . She does n't know why , she told him . Maybe , she said , it 's because they 're scared .", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/some-northern-virginia-parents-wanted-two-books-with-lgbtq-characters-removed-from-schools-officials-said-no/2020/01/15/06f8be0e-36df-11ea-bb7b-265f4554af6d_story.html", "kws": ["LGBTQ^^books", "LGBTQ^^kids", "LGBTQ^^characters", "LGBTQ^^literature", "LGBTQ", "transgender^^students", "LGBTQ^^advocates", "schools", "elementary^^schools", "LGBTQ^^texts", "LGBTQ^^themes", "public^^schools", "LGBTQ^^content", "Public^^School", "School^^officials", "School^^administrators", "elementary^^school", "Loudoun^^County^^parents", "elementary^^school^^shelves", "Loudoun^^schools"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Society": 0.9988279938697815}, "second_cat": {"Society_Other": 0.9988279938697815}}}

The Cavaliers made # 9 Florida State play Virginia 's game . Florida State still won , 54-50 . A run of six straight turnovers in the latter stages of the first half fueled an 11-0 FSU run that sent the Seminoles into the locker room up 31-24 .

It was fun and I get why people wanted to do it even if I would n't be comfortable doing it myself . I say that so you know I do n't really have a problem with people dressing up in costumes for big conventions . But I do not get the furry thing . Somehow it seems very different and I 'm not sure why because , on the surface , it 's sort of similar . I 'm not really sure I could explain why it seems different to me , only that I know I 'd be comfortable going to a convention with a bunch of people dressed up as Star Wars or Marvel movie characters looking through piles of rare bootlegs or back issues . In fact , for better or worse , those are my people . But I do n't think I would feel at all comfortable going to a furry convention . Is it because this is clearly an odd sexual fetish for a lot of people ? Maybe , but then I 've seen some of the cosplay costumes worn by women at ComicCon and those are also pretty obviously sexual in nature . At one ComicCon there was a group photo of women dressed as Princess Leia in the slave girl outfit . No one complained . As it happens , the largest furry convention in the world took place last month in Chicago and a guy named Andrew Callaghan went there and interviewed people . Callaghan runs a YouTube channel called All Gas No Brakes , the theme of which seems to be showing up at gatherings of unusual people and just letting them talk . For instance , last week he published a video in which he attended a flat earth conference . He also has a video from Burning Man , and one from something called Alien Con . There 's even one from a Donald Trump Jr. book club gathering . Callaghan does n't editorialize much -- he mostly just lets people talk and gives an occasional Office-style glance of disbelief into the camera . Anyway , his tour of Midwest FurFest 2019 is every bit as strange as you might imagine . There are some people in full costumes and some who seem to be really carried away with the idea they are not human . Later on the clip takes a detour into alien insemination sex toys . There 's no nudity here but this is both very weird and very NSFW . Consider yourself warned .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrCEA97", "title": "Meet the impeachment managers : Nancy Pelosi taps a diverse team with legal credentials to prosecute the case against Trump", "content": "All but one of them come with legal experience , whether gleaned from evening law courses or honed while winning the conviction of an FBI agent who was seduced by a Soviet spy and traded secrets for cash and gold . Two have served in Congress for more than a quarter-century , while another two have just finished their first year there . In selecting the seven lawmakers who will serve as managers of the impeachment case against President Donald Trump , Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California turned to a diverse team from her Democratic caucus with an array of litigation credentials . Its task , which officially began on Wednesday as the House voted to appoint them , is to prosecute the case for removal of a president in only the third such trial in American history . `` The emphasis is on comfort level in the courtroom , '' Pelosi said Wednesday at a news conference to announce her choices , hours before the House voted to ratify them . `` The emphasis is making the strongest possible case to protect and defend our Constitution , to seek the truth for the American people . '' The group also reflects the historic diversity of the House Democrats , with two African Americans , a Latina and three women . `` The gorgeous mosaic of the House Democratic caucus is represented by its racial , its gender , its regional , its ideological and its religious diversity , '' said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York , who with the other managers flanked Pelosi at her news conference Wednesday morning in a studio in the Capitol . `` That is what we saw onstage . '' It offered a vivid contrast with the group of managers who prosecuted President Bill Clinton during the Senate 's last impeachment trial in 1999 , a team of 13 white men . House Democrats formally hand off articles of impeachment against President Trump to Senate : ` Today we will make history ' '' Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , which led the investigation into charges that Trump pressured Ukraine to help his reelection campaign , will be the lead prosecutor . Schiff and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , were unsurprising choices to present the case against Trump , given their public roles in the inquiry and drafting of impeachment articles . And on Wednesday , it fell to Nadler , who earned his law degree by attending evening courses while serving in the New York state Assembly , to oversee Wednesday 's debate on the resolution that formally approved the impeachment managers , allowing the articles of impeachment to be sent to the Senate . Behind him sat Pelosi , Schiff and the other managers : Jeffries , Reps. Val B. Demings of Florida , Jason Crow of Colorado , Zoe Lofgren of California and Sylvia R. Garcia of Texas . Lofgren is the sole House Democrat to have participated in the past three presidential impeachment processes , having worked as a committee aide during the proceedings against Richard M. Nixon and served on the Judiciary Committee during the impeachment of Bill Clinton . And while Demings does not have a formal background as a lawyer , she was the first woman to be police chief of Orlando , Florida , and sits on both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees , giving her a prominent perch to participate in the impeachment inquiry . The two freshmen lawmakers named to the group , Garcia and Crow , both bring critical perspectives for the arguments to remove Trump . Garcia , one of the first two Latina women to represent Texas in Congress , is a former judge , while Crow , a former Army ranger and litigator , is considered an authority on national security matters , which are at the heart of the Democratic argument for Trump 's removal . And Schiff , a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles who secured the conviction against the FBI agent , won his seat by defeating James E. Rogan , a Republican who had served as an impeachment manager in the 1999 Clinton trial . In a quirk of history , Rogan 's predecessor had also worked on an impeachment inquiry , into the Watergate break-in that led to Nixon 's resignation . Pelosi began conducting individual meetings with lawmakers this month to gauge their interest in the role of manager , according to a person familiar with the meetings but not authorized to discuss them publicly . She called most of the group on Tuesday to inform them of their selection , and then met with the full group privately Wednesday morning . `` This is all about protecting the Constitution , '' Demings told reporters as she left the news conference . `` I 've taken four oaths in my lifetime -- two as a law enforcement officer and two here -- and I take them very , very seriously . '' With only two presidential impeachment trials to serve as a guide , it is up to the group of seven to determine how they will divide the responsibilities . During the Clinton trial , lawmakers spent their two-week holiday break carefully drafting speeches and arguments , splitting up the delivery of opening and closing arguments as well as a breakdown of the articles of impeachment themselves . This group has far less time to prepare , with opening arguments likely to begin next week . The managers huddled behind closed doors Wednesday afternoon , but most lawmakers would not say what they discussed . When asked how the work would be divided among the seven , Nadler answered , `` Appropriately . '' Hours later , the managers flanked Pelosi as she used a handful of pens to formally sign the articles of impeachment . They then marched through the Capitol Rotunda to the Senate chamber , arriving at the ornately decorated double doors to deliver the charges they will soon argue against the president . Zoe Lofgren : A veteran of two impeachment inquiries When it comes to impeachment , Rep. Zoe Lofgren , D-Calif. , is arguably the institutional memory for Congress . She was a member of the House Judiciary Committee in 1998 when it approved articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton for lying about an affair with a White House intern . And as a young law student in 1974 , she helped the committee draft its Watergate charges against President Richard Nixon . Now -- 46 years after the Nixon case -- the 72-year-old lawmaker will take a high-profile role in the nation 's third impeachment trial , serving as one of the managers who will prosecute the House 's case against President Donald Trump in the Senate . For Speaker Nancy Pelosi , the decision to pick Lofgren puts a seasoned , even-tempered ally on the small team of lawmakers whose arguments during the Senate proceedings will be closely scrutinized by other lawmakers , the news media and -- perhaps most importantly -- voters in an election year . Unlike many members of the Judiciary Committee , Lofgren resisted calling for the impeachment of Trump for efforts to obstruct the two-year investigation by Robert Mueller , the special counsel , into Russia 's interference in the 2016 election . After Mueller presented his report detailing 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president , she said that Democrats had not proven that charge to the American people . `` In retrospect , it probably was a mistake '' to have relied on Mueller 's investigation , she said later . But Lofgren embraced impeachment over the revelations about Trump 's efforts to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rivals . And now , Pelosi is counting on her to bring decades of historical perspective to the arguments she and the other managers will make during the trial . Lofgren was raised in the Silicon Valley suburbs of San Francisco , the daughter of a school-cafeteria cook and a beer-truck driver . As an undergraduate student at Stanford University , she worked as an intern for Rep. Don Edwards , a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee , whom she replaced when he retired in 1995 . Now a senior member of Judiciary Committee , she is something of a temperate outlier on a panel that is known for attracting the most fiery , outspoken and partisan lawmakers . When constitutional scholars testified before the committee last year , Lofgren brought the official , 528-page record of the Nixon impeachment case . She said she had taken it out again to better understand what the founders meant by setting the standard of `` high crimes and misdemeanors '' for impeachment . -- Michael D. Shear Hakeem Jeffries : The Democrats ' messaging guru Standing on the House floor hours before voting to impeach President Donald Trump , Rep. Hakeem Jeffries issued a characteristically quotable pledge . `` We will impeach Donald John Trump , '' said Jeffries , D-N.Y. `` We will clarify that , in America , no one is above the law . '' Having already made good on the first prong of his vow , he will take up the second in the coming weeks as one of the impeachment managers who will prosecute House Democrats ' case against Trump at trial in the Senate . Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's decision to elevate him to the sought-after role is a sign of her trust in Jeffries , who as the No. 5 House Democrat is the highest-ranked member of leadership to be included on the team . Jeffries , 48 , is openly ambitious and is regarded by many Democrats as poised to become the first black speaker of the House when Pelosi steps aside . Elected in November as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus , Jeffries , of Brooklyn , has emerged as one of the Democrats ' top messaging lieutenants , letting acidic rebukes of the president and Republicans roll off his tongue even as he seeks to focus attention on the caucus ' legislative priorities . `` We must hold this president accountable for his stunning abuse of power , '' Jeffries said as the House Judiciary Committee debated the articles of impeachment . `` We must hold this president accountable for undermining America 's national security . We must impeach this president . '' Jeffries has shown few signs of tempering that approach . When a reporter on Tuesday asked him about comments made by Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California , the Republican leader , suggesting former Vice President Joe Biden should suspend his presidential campaign during the Senate trial , Jeffries deadpanned , `` Who ? '' `` We will not take political advice from Kevin McCarthy , '' he replied icily . As likely to quote from the Bible as he is from 1990s hip-hop lyrics , Jeffries ' rhetorical skills were honed as a high-powered litigator working at an elite corporate law firm in New York , where he defended CBS in a lawsuit over Janet Jackson 's wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl . Jeffries won his first race in 2006 , securing a seat in the New York State Assembly after two unsuccessful attempts . He was elected to Congress in 2012 . -- Catie Edmondson Val Demings : Offers law enforcement experience As one of the newer members of the House Intelligence Committee , Rep. Val B. Demings , D-Fla. , was one of the last to question Robert Mueller , the special counsel , during the seven-hour hearing in July on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election . But it was a question from Demings about President Donald Trump 's written answers to the inquiry that elicited a rare and striking concession outside the contents of Mueller 's report . When she asked whether the president 's `` answers showed that he was n't always being truthful , '' Mueller appeared to agree : `` I would say generally . '' It is that approach to questioning , coupled with her experience on both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees , that helped propel Demings , in only her second term in Congress , to the role of impeachment manager nearly six months after that exchange . She participated in both the public hearings into the allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine for assistance in his reelection campaign and the committee work on the two articles of impeachment that passed the House last month . `` I 've taken four oaths in my lifetime , two as a law enforcement officer and two now as a member of Congress , '' she said in December . `` Each oath stated that I will protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic . '' `` I 've enforced the laws and now I write the laws , '' she added . `` And I know that nobody is above the law . '' Demings , 62 , grew up in Jacksonville , Florida , where she shared a two-room home with her six older siblings and her parents , Elouise , a maid , and James , a janitor . After attending segregated schools , she became the first in her family to graduate college , with a criminology degree from Florida State University . `` I believe in the promise of America because I 've seen the promise of America , '' Demings said at that December hearing . She went on to join the Orlando , Fla. , Police Department , becoming its first female chief in 2007 . After serving on the force for 27 years , she retired in 2011 . The next year , she narrowly lost a race for the House of Representatives . In 2014 , she passed on a congressional rematch to run for mayor of Orange County , home to Orlando , before later withdrawing from that race . In 2016 , she won her congressional seat . Demings enjoys -- in what her congressional biography calls her `` very limited free time '' -- riding her Harley-Davidson Road King Classic motorcycle . -- Emily Cochrane Adam Schiff : Brings experience and controversy As a young federal prosecutor in Los Angeles 30 years ago , Adam B. Schiff won the conviction of an FBI agent who was seduced by a Soviet spy and traded secrets for gold and cash -- a case , he said then , `` of government misconduct and government corruption of the highest and most disturbing order . '' Schiff is now a 10th-term Democratic House member and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee , and he soon may find himself repeating that sentiment , this time as the lead House manager in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump . His selection by Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hardly a surprise . A fellow Californian , Schiff , 59 , first began digging into the accusations that gave rise to the impeachment inquiry when he pushed for the disclosure to Congress of a whistleblower complaint related to Trump that the administration was refusing to share . Once that complaint came out , alleging a scheme by the president to enlist Ukraine to help him in the 2020 election , Schiff led the investigation that resulted in the president 's impeachment for pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals . Strait-laced and slightly nerdy , Schiff tightly controlled the divisive process . When Rep. Matt Gaetz , R-Fla. , muscled his way into a closed-door hearing without invitation , Schiff calmly told him to `` absent yourself . '' When two dozen Republicans stormed the secure hearing room , accusing Schiff of running a secret `` Soviet-style process , '' he suspended the session rather than create the spectacle of having his colleagues removed by Capitol Police . `` He 's a full package , '' Pelosi said in an interview last fall , adding : `` He knows his purpose . He knows his subject . He always thinks strategically , and he respectfully connects with people . '' Republicans revile Schiff and have jumped on him for , among other things , dramatizing a telephone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine . Trump calls him `` Little Pencil Neck '' and `` Shifty Schiff . '' A lawyer educated at Stanford University and Harvard Law School , Schiff won a seat in the California Senate in 1996 ; in 2000 , he was elected to the House by beating a Republican incumbent , James Rogan , who -- in a curious twist -- had been a manager in the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton . Schiff makes no secret of his disdain for the president . In an interview in October , he called Trump `` infantile '' and said he had brought `` ill repute to the office '' of the presidency . -- Sheryl Gay Stolberg Jerrold Nadler : Will tie case to Constitution When Rep. Jerrold Nadler campaigned two years ago to be the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee , he billed himself as the `` strongest member to lead a potential impeachment . '' Nadler got the job , and last December , he led the Judiciary Committee as it drafted and approved two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump . Now , it appears his work is only halfway done . Speaker Nancy Pelosi chose Nadler on Wednesday to serve on the team of lawmakers who will prosecute the case against Trump in the Senate . He will work alongside Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California , the chairman of the Intelligence Committee , who oversaw the House 's Ukraine investigation , and five other managers . If Schiff 's fact-finding formed the basis for Trump 's impeachment -- he uncovered a campaign by the president to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals -- Nadler 's work provided the legal and constitutional case that Trump 's misconduct rose to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors . He is likely to play a similar role in the Senate 's proceeding , laying out for lawmakers why the president should be removed . Nadler , 72 , is the son of a chicken farmer . He has represented the West Side of Manhattan since the 1990s and built a reputation as a loquacious defender of civil liberties . That position , and Nadler 's fierce opposition to a proposed Trump Organization redevelopment project , earned the Democratic congressman the early ire of Trump , then merely a tabloid-famous New York real estate developer . But as chairman of the Judiciary Committee , Nadler has arguably been a bigger thorn in the president 's side . The famously partisan panel has aggressively pursued investigations of Trump 's immigration policies and of possible abuses by Trump around the special counsel 's Russia investigation . Before the Ukraine matter emerged this fall , Nadler spent months trying to build an impeachment case based on the findings of Robert Mueller 's report on Russian election interference and possible obstruction of justice by Trump . The push won him acclaim from liberals but chafed Pelosi , who conspicuously second-guessed some of his decisions to colleagues . As a manager , Nadler brings with him a team of lawyers who were integral to the House 's impeachment proceedings , including Barry Berke , a veteran white-collar defense lawyer , and Norman L. Eisen , a former White House ethics czar and well-known liberal watchdog . Nadler is no newcomer to impeachment . As a younger man , he earned a national reputation for his unapologetic defense of President Bill Clinton when he faced impeachment in 1998 . This fall , Republicans delighted in throwing Nadler 's dire warnings about a partisan impeachment back in his face as the chairman marched ahead to press charges against Trump . `` The American people are watching , and they wo n't forget , '' he said 21 years ago . `` You may have the votes , you may have the muscle , but you lack the legitimacy of a national consensus and the Constitution . This partisan coup d'\u00e9tat will go down in the history of this nation in infamy . '' -- Nicholas Fandos Jason Crow : Pressed to launch inquiry As a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan , Rep. Jason Crow , who flipped a Republican-held seat in 2018 , has quickly emerged in the Democratic caucus as a leading voice on national security . Drawing on those credentials and his experience as a litigator , Speaker Nancy Pelosi named the Colorado Democrat as an impeachment manager on Wednesday , selecting him as part of the team of lawmakers who will play a high-profile role prosecuting House Democrats ' case against President Donald Trump in the Senate trial . Crow is a first-term lawmaker -- one of only two among a seven-person manager team -- and he does not serve on any of the committees that have been leading the impeachment inquiry . So his selection to play a high-profile role in the impeachment trial underscores the crucial role national security-minded freshmen have played in the House investigation . Crow was among a group of seven freshmen from conservative-leaning districts -- all veterans or former intelligence analysts -- who wrote an op-ed urging Congress to impeach Trump if the allegations were true that he withheld military aid to Ukraine as part of an attempt to get the country to investigate his political rivals . The piece was seen by many as a crucial development that encouraged Democratic lawmakers by indicating they had enough backing -- including among their politically vulnerable colleagues -- to press ahead and open an inquiry into the president . `` He allegedly sought to use the very security assistance dollars appropriated by Congress to create stability in the world , to help root out corruption and to protect our national security interests , for his own personal gain , '' Crow and his colleagues wrote . `` These allegations are stunning , both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent . '' While Crow is best known for his advocacy on gun safety measures and his service in the Army , where he was honored with the Bronze Star , he worked as a litigator after his tours in Iraq and Afghanistan , specializing in white-collar defense and government investigations . He has since emerged as one of the most outspoken freshmen from a swing district urging the House to take on Trump . `` If Congress does n't stand up to these abuses , then our system of checks and balances will have failed , '' Crow said shortly after announcing he would support the impeachment inquiry . `` It 's clear that we must respond with the full weight of Congress . '' -- Catie Edmondson Sylvia Garcia : A lawyer and former judge Rep. Sylvia R. Garcia , a freshman Democrat who was named Wednesday as a House impeachment manager , made history last year when she was sworn in as one of the first two Latina congresswomen from Texas . A lawyer and former judge , she has an up-from-the-bootstraps personal story . Born in a South Texas farming community , the eighth of 10 children , Garcia `` saw her parents struggle to raise her and her siblings , '' her website says , adding that her parents `` taught her that with hard work and a good education she could accomplish anything . '' She attended Texas Woman 's University on a scholarship , graduated with a degree in social work and political science , and went on to obtain her law degree from Texas Southern University . She served as the presiding judge of the Houston Municipal System and was later elected city controller , then served in the Texas Senate . Elected to the House of Representatives in 2018 , she became a member of the Judiciary Committee and a fierce critic of the president . On Wednesday , she said on Twitter she was `` honored '' to have been chosen to be on the team of impeachment managers . `` I take my responsibility seriously because we 're working to defend our Constitution at a pivotal moment in our democracy , '' she said . Hours earlier , before her selection had been announced , she appeared to preview a central plank of the group 's case against the president . `` Trump is a clear and present danger to our democracy , and he must be held accountable , '' she wrote on Twitter . -- Sheryl Gay Stolberg c. 2020 The New York Times Company", "url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-nw-nyt-trump-impeachment-managers-20200116-zotoxuz34vfypocs3cidflwjxm-story.html", "kws": ["impeachment^^managers", "impeachment", "impeachment^^manager", "Speaker^^Nancy^^Pelosi", "impeachment^^articles", "Nancy^^Pelosi", "litigation^^credentials", "Pelosi^^steps", "President^^Bill^^Clinton", "Democratic^^lawmakers", "Judiciary^^Committee", "Republicans", "House^^Democrats", "lawyers", "Congress", "leadership", "government^^misconduct", "legal^^experience", "President^^Trump", "constitutional^^scholars"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Federal": 1.0000100135803223}}}

In its place , it clings to a past that if it continues will see this once great nation become a shell of itself while the modern world runs over us . How can this be ? To answer this question , we have to ask ourselves some questions that force us to take a hard look at ourselves . Will we ever be a nation that relies on diplomacy instead of might ? Robert Reich recently reported that one-fourth of our nation 's population has lived its entire life with us at war . This is what happens when we get sucked into wars that have zero end game . It 's also what happens when we fail to learn from our own history , case in point , Korea and Vietnam . The long term result of an entire generation of post 9/11 kids growing up thinking war is a normal aspect of life while remaining ignorant of our history is our future leaders will think nothing of relying on war to solve their international disputes . War economies are never booming economies . Despite our low unemployment , most workers are earning less today than they were before the economy crashed in 2008 . It is more common to see adults holding down multiple part time jobs or second jobs because their primary work fails to provide a livable wage . Today 's youth may never be able to retire because they may never be able to secure enough money to enjoy old age . If you believe in the saying , `` If you always do what you have always done , you will always get what you have always gotten , '' then you will not be shocked when it results in a constantly sluggish and underperforming economy , more terrorist threats at home , and an inability to sit at the table like adults and solve disputes . How does the United States expect to ever get out of the Middle East while remaining an oil dependent nation ? Once again , we failed to learn from history . As long as we insist on sucking oil out of the ground and ocean floor , we will remain involved in the Middle East . As long as our leaders suck up to Big Oil , we will remain involved in the Middle East . We know this because with every oil crisis and every Middle East crisis since the 1970s , our leaders have continued to side with the special interests of major oil companies rather than the interests of voters who could easily have very cheap and renewable energy today had we cut the cord 45 years ago . Since these companies are dependent on foreign oil producers for increased profits and since they also do not care if they destroy our planet to drill for oil , they will continue to line the pockets of Republicans and Democrats , ensuring the cost of solar and wind energy remain costly . Do n't count on affordable energy anytime soon . You do not have to be a rocket scientist to know we could walk away from the Middle East without fearing an oil embargo every time tensions rise . You just have to be a greedy bastard to make sure we remain dependent on big oil and sufficiently immoral to not care about the fallout it has for the average citizen or the planet . When will our environment matter ? Rising seas , melting icebergs , massive storms never before experienced , parched land , burning rainforests , and lung choking air have yet to convince one political party , the GOP , that we have a problem with our planet 's environment . It should not surprise us when this is the same party that describes their opponents as elitists because they value education , while they -LRB- the GOP -RRB- eliminate environmental protections . There is more to learn when you crack open a book and read than by watching some loud mouth on Fox News tell you what to think . Ignorance is bliss until your roof blows off your house and you get sucked out by a category five hurricane that science warned you about . The GOP would have you believe life was better when you suffered from black lung , TB , and dysentery . It 's better to send young men and women halfway around the world to kill Muslims for the good of Big Oil and corrupt evangelicals than it is to put them to work cleaning up our environment by actually producing smaller carbon footprints through a modernization of our approach to living and respecting the planet . Will we ever see the rise of powerful third and fourth political parties ? Do n't count on it , not as long as the two current parties control the process . Perhaps , if enough fed up billionaires with a conscience decide to make it happen , however , what are the odds of that happening ? Both political parties are to blame for our failure to join the modern world . They have turned our political system into one gigantic pissing contest which results in nothing getting done . There is no bipartisanship and do n't bet on there becoming any even if Trump is voted out of office . It generally does not happen unless there is an emergency , think war , so neither party has to carry the banner as being un-American . If Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill were in politics today , they 'd get run out of office by their own parties . Cooperation is something we teach our kindergartners . Leadership is now where adults act like they belong in preschool . When will we wise up about college ? Public education does not serve the needs of the public nearly as much as it buys into the idea that everyone is better off if they earn a college degree . The more people who possess something , the less value it has . I do n't care what the product is , the more of it in the hands of people , the less it is worth . A college degree is now nothing more than a product sold through a dozen years of advertising called public education . For most folks who earn a degree , it leaves them with a massive debt to pay off in a career that has nothing to do with what they majored in while attending college . Parents , quit trying to one up the Jones ' and pressure your children to sacrifice their childhood in the name of college . Make your kids get dirty doing manual labor around the house . Expect them to do chores , hold down a part time job during summer or after school , and make them see how people in the real world actually labor away as adults . Guess what ? Some might actually decide they prefer to work than go to school for a BA that means nothing more than a high school diploma once meant . There is nothing wrong with learning a trade and bypassing college debt and a life of trying to navigate one 's way up the career ladder . Hundreds of thousands of jobs in the trades go unfilled every year which slows the growth of our economy , all because we have brainwashed our children to think they have to go to college to ever amount to anything . There are not enough corner offices for every college grad , which is why it helps to have an MA if you want to work as a manager at a fast foot joint . Twenty bucks an hour for a masters is not going to get you to the same spot in life as three or four times that rate as a mechanic , plumber , welder , electrician , or contractor . Will we ever have anything else to offer other nations other than our military ? Let 's face it , America is being played by other nations . While we insist on policing the world , more of our allies are willing to let us . Is it a coincidence that while more democratic nations are offering affordable health care , cheaper college education , and greater services to their tax payers , we are mired in an endless series of taxpayer funded wars while falling behind in education , healthcare , senior services , and public transportation ? In the process , we have created a two class system of haves and have nots which will add to the increased turmoil we face inside our borders . More violent deaths , an increase in suicides , and more social protests have resulted since 9/11 . These things do not happen when a nation is at peace and able to invest in itself and offer hope for all , you know , like this nation was able to throughout most of the previous century . Will we ever stop caring about the color of a person 's skin or the religion they practice ? In fact , will we ever stop caring about the lifestyle choices of people if they are not harming anyone ? Get over the fact your neighbors are gay , your boss is Hindu , your teacher is atheist , or your doctor is female . They are not the problem . You can call yourself anything you want , but most people care more about your actions . Hate , ignorance , and the idea your way of thinking is the only right way are cancers that keep this nation from being fully healthy and vibrant . Good comes in all shapes , colors , and belief systems . So does hate . It 's simple ; we either choose to be an example of good or bad . If you think being good means supporting ideas and movements that limit the rights and freedoms of others that you enjoy , you are a hypocrite , or worse , brainwashed . Have we missed the boat ? Only time will tell if it is too late . However , we did not become the great nation other countries looked up to because we failed to tackle our problems . We have shown on many occasions just how much we can accomplish when we agree to confront all challenges and not just military threats . However , it is safe to say as long as we remain a nation divided from the top down and split into haves and have nots , the odds of us remaining the greatest nation on the planet diminish with each passing day . We can captain the ship or cling to life rafts . The choice is ours .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrCIsOt", "title": "Meet the impeachment managers : Nancy Pelosi taps a diverse team with legal credentials to prosecute the case against Trump", "content": "All but one of them come with legal experience , whether gleaned from evening law courses or honed while winning the conviction of an FBI agent who was seduced by a Soviet spy and traded secrets for cash and gold . Two have served in Congress for more than a quarter-century , while another two have just finished their first year there . In selecting the seven lawmakers who will serve as managers of the impeachment case against President Donald Trump , Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California turned to a diverse team from her Democratic caucus with an array of litigation credentials . Its task , which officially began on Wednesday as the House voted to appoint them , is to prosecute the case for removal of a president in only the third such trial in American history . `` The emphasis is on comfort level in the courtroom , '' Pelosi said Wednesday at a news conference to announce her choices , hours before the House voted to ratify them . `` The emphasis is making the strongest possible case to protect and defend our Constitution , to seek the truth for the American people . '' The group also reflects the historic diversity of the House Democrats , with two African Americans , a Latina and three women . `` The gorgeous mosaic of the House Democratic caucus is represented by its racial , its gender , its regional , its ideological and its religious diversity , '' said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York , who with the other managers flanked Pelosi at her news conference Wednesday morning in a studio in the Capitol . `` That is what we saw onstage . '' It offered a vivid contrast with the group of managers who prosecuted President Bill Clinton during the Senate 's last impeachment trial in 1999 , a team of 13 white men . House Democrats formally hand off articles of impeachment against President Trump to Senate : ` Today we will make history ' '' Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , which led the investigation into charges that Trump pressured Ukraine to help his reelection campaign , will be the lead prosecutor . Schiff and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , were unsurprising choices to present the case against Trump , given their public roles in the inquiry and drafting of impeachment articles . And on Wednesday , it fell to Nadler , who earned his law degree by attending evening courses while serving in the New York state Assembly , to oversee Wednesday 's debate on the resolution that formally approved the impeachment managers , allowing the articles of impeachment to be sent to the Senate . Behind him sat Pelosi , Schiff and the other managers : Jeffries , Reps. Val B. Demings of Florida , Jason Crow of Colorado , Zoe Lofgren of California and Sylvia R. Garcia of Texas . Lofgren is the sole House Democrat to have participated in the past three presidential impeachment processes , having worked as a committee aide during the proceedings against Richard M. Nixon and served on the Judiciary Committee during the impeachment of Bill Clinton . And while Demings does not have a formal background as a lawyer , she was the first woman to be police chief of Orlando , Florida , and sits on both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees , giving her a prominent perch to participate in the impeachment inquiry . The two freshmen lawmakers named to the group , Garcia and Crow , both bring critical perspectives for the arguments to remove Trump . Garcia , one of the first two Latina women to represent Texas in Congress , is a former judge , while Crow , a former Army ranger and litigator , is considered an authority on national security matters , which are at the heart of the Democratic argument for Trump 's removal . And Schiff , a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles who secured the conviction against the FBI agent , won his seat by defeating James E. Rogan , a Republican who had served as an impeachment manager in the 1999 Clinton trial . In a quirk of history , Rogan 's predecessor had also worked on an impeachment inquiry , into the Watergate break-in that led to Nixon 's resignation . Pelosi began conducting individual meetings with lawmakers this month to gauge their interest in the role of manager , according to a person familiar with the meetings but not authorized to discuss them publicly . She called most of the group on Tuesday to inform them of their selection , and then met with the full group privately Wednesday morning . `` This is all about protecting the Constitution , '' Demings told reporters as she left the news conference . `` I 've taken four oaths in my lifetime -- two as a law enforcement officer and two here -- and I take them very , very seriously . '' With only two presidential impeachment trials to serve as a guide , it is up to the group of seven to determine how they will divide the responsibilities . During the Clinton trial , lawmakers spent their two-week holiday break carefully drafting speeches and arguments , splitting up the delivery of opening and closing arguments as well as a breakdown of the articles of impeachment themselves . This group has far less time to prepare , with opening arguments likely to begin next week . The managers huddled behind closed doors Wednesday afternoon , but most lawmakers would not say what they discussed . When asked how the work would be divided among the seven , Nadler answered , `` Appropriately . '' Hours later , the managers flanked Pelosi as she used a handful of pens to formally sign the articles of impeachment . They then marched through the Capitol Rotunda to the Senate chamber , arriving at the ornately decorated double doors to deliver the charges they will soon argue against the president . Zoe Lofgren : A veteran of two impeachment inquiries When it comes to impeachment , Rep. Zoe Lofgren , D-Calif. , is arguably the institutional memory for Congress . She was a member of the House Judiciary Committee in 1998 when it approved articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton for lying about an affair with a White House intern . And as a young law student in 1974 , she helped the committee draft its Watergate charges against President Richard Nixon . Now -- 46 years after the Nixon case -- the 72-year-old lawmaker will take a high-profile role in the nation 's third impeachment trial , serving as one of the managers who will prosecute the House 's case against President Donald Trump in the Senate . For Speaker Nancy Pelosi , the decision to pick Lofgren puts a seasoned , even-tempered ally on the small team of lawmakers whose arguments during the Senate proceedings will be closely scrutinized by other lawmakers , the news media and -- perhaps most importantly -- voters in an election year . Unlike many members of the Judiciary Committee , Lofgren resisted calling for the impeachment of Trump for efforts to obstruct the two-year investigation by Robert Mueller , the special counsel , into Russia 's interference in the 2016 election . After Mueller presented his report detailing 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president , she said that Democrats had not proven that charge to the American people . `` In retrospect , it probably was a mistake '' to have relied on Mueller 's investigation , she said later . But Lofgren embraced impeachment over the revelations about Trump 's efforts to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rivals . And now , Pelosi is counting on her to bring decades of historical perspective to the arguments she and the other managers will make during the trial . Lofgren was raised in the Silicon Valley suburbs of San Francisco , the daughter of a school-cafeteria cook and a beer-truck driver . As an undergraduate student at Stanford University , she worked as an intern for Rep. Don Edwards , a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee , whom she replaced when he retired in 1995 . Now a senior member of Judiciary Committee , she is something of a temperate outlier on a panel that is known for attracting the most fiery , outspoken and partisan lawmakers . When constitutional scholars testified before the committee last year , Lofgren brought the official , 528-page record of the Nixon impeachment case . She said she had taken it out again to better understand what the founders meant by setting the standard of `` high crimes and misdemeanors '' for impeachment . -- Michael D. Shear Hakeem Jeffries : The Democrats ' messaging guru Standing on the House floor hours before voting to impeach President Donald Trump , Rep. Hakeem Jeffries issued a characteristically quotable pledge . `` We will impeach Donald John Trump , '' said Jeffries , D-N.Y. `` We will clarify that , in America , no one is above the law . '' Having already made good on the first prong of his vow , he will take up the second in the coming weeks as one of the impeachment managers who will prosecute House Democrats ' case against Trump at trial in the Senate . Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's decision to elevate him to the sought-after role is a sign of her trust in Jeffries , who as the No. 5 House Democrat is the highest-ranked member of leadership to be included on the team . Jeffries , 48 , is openly ambitious and is regarded by many Democrats as poised to become the first black speaker of the House when Pelosi steps aside . Elected in November as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus , Jeffries , of Brooklyn , has emerged as one of the Democrats ' top messaging lieutenants , letting acidic rebukes of the president and Republicans roll off his tongue even as he seeks to focus attention on the caucus ' legislative priorities . `` We must hold this president accountable for his stunning abuse of power , '' Jeffries said as the House Judiciary Committee debated the articles of impeachment . `` We must hold this president accountable for undermining America 's national security . We must impeach this president . '' Jeffries has shown few signs of tempering that approach . When a reporter on Tuesday asked him about comments made by Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California , the Republican leader , suggesting former Vice President Joe Biden should suspend his presidential campaign during the Senate trial , Jeffries deadpanned , `` Who ? '' `` We will not take political advice from Kevin McCarthy , '' he replied icily . As likely to quote from the Bible as he is from 1990s hip-hop lyrics , Jeffries ' rhetorical skills were honed as a high-powered litigator working at an elite corporate law firm in New York , where he defended CBS in a lawsuit over Janet Jackson 's wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl . Jeffries won his first race in 2006 , securing a seat in the New York State Assembly after two unsuccessful attempts . He was elected to Congress in 2012 . -- Catie Edmondson Val Demings : Offers law enforcement experience As one of the newer members of the House Intelligence Committee , Rep. Val B. Demings , D-Fla. , was one of the last to question Robert Mueller , the special counsel , during the seven-hour hearing in July on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election . But it was a question from Demings about President Donald Trump 's written answers to the inquiry that elicited a rare and striking concession outside the contents of Mueller 's report . When she asked whether the president 's `` answers showed that he was n't always being truthful , '' Mueller appeared to agree : `` I would say generally . '' It is that approach to questioning , coupled with her experience on both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees , that helped propel Demings , in only her second term in Congress , to the role of impeachment manager nearly six months after that exchange . She participated in both the public hearings into the allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine for assistance in his reelection campaign and the committee work on the two articles of impeachment that passed the House last month . `` I 've taken four oaths in my lifetime , two as a law enforcement officer and two now as a member of Congress , '' she said in December . `` Each oath stated that I will protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic . '' `` I 've enforced the laws and now I write the laws , '' she added . `` And I know that nobody is above the law . '' Demings , 62 , grew up in Jacksonville , Florida , where she shared a two-room home with her six older siblings and her parents , Elouise , a maid , and James , a janitor . After attending segregated schools , she became the first in her family to graduate college , with a criminology degree from Florida State University . `` I believe in the promise of America because I 've seen the promise of America , '' Demings said at that December hearing . She went on to join the Orlando , Fla. , Police Department , becoming its first female chief in 2007 . After serving on the force for 27 years , she retired in 2011 . The next year , she narrowly lost a race for the House of Representatives . In 2014 , she passed on a congressional rematch to run for mayor of Orange County , home to Orlando , before later withdrawing from that race . In 2016 , she won her congressional seat . Demings enjoys -- in what her congressional biography calls her `` very limited free time '' -- riding her Harley-Davidson Road King Classic motorcycle . -- Emily Cochrane Adam Schiff : Brings experience and controversy As a young federal prosecutor in Los Angeles 30 years ago , Adam B. Schiff won the conviction of an FBI agent who was seduced by a Soviet spy and traded secrets for gold and cash -- a case , he said then , `` of government misconduct and government corruption of the highest and most disturbing order . '' Schiff is now a 10th-term Democratic House member and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee , and he soon may find himself repeating that sentiment , this time as the lead House manager in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump . His selection by Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hardly a surprise . A fellow Californian , Schiff , 59 , first began digging into the accusations that gave rise to the impeachment inquiry when he pushed for the disclosure to Congress of a whistleblower complaint related to Trump that the administration was refusing to share . Once that complaint came out , alleging a scheme by the president to enlist Ukraine to help him in the 2020 election , Schiff led the investigation that resulted in the president 's impeachment for pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals . Strait-laced and slightly nerdy , Schiff tightly controlled the divisive process . When Rep. Matt Gaetz , R-Fla. , muscled his way into a closed-door hearing without invitation , Schiff calmly told him to `` absent yourself . '' When two dozen Republicans stormed the secure hearing room , accusing Schiff of running a secret `` Soviet-style process , '' he suspended the session rather than create the spectacle of having his colleagues removed by Capitol Police . `` He 's a full package , '' Pelosi said in an interview last fall , adding : `` He knows his purpose . He knows his subject . He always thinks strategically , and he respectfully connects with people . '' Republicans revile Schiff and have jumped on him for , among other things , dramatizing a telephone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine . Trump calls him `` Little Pencil Neck '' and `` Shifty Schiff . '' A lawyer educated at Stanford University and Harvard Law School , Schiff won a seat in the California Senate in 1996 ; in 2000 , he was elected to the House by beating a Republican incumbent , James Rogan , who -- in a curious twist -- had been a manager in the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton . Schiff makes no secret of his disdain for the president . In an interview in October , he called Trump `` infantile '' and said he had brought `` ill repute to the office '' of the presidency . -- Sheryl Gay Stolberg Jerrold Nadler : Will tie case to Constitution When Rep. Jerrold Nadler campaigned two years ago to be the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee , he billed himself as the `` strongest member to lead a potential impeachment . '' Nadler got the job , and last December , he led the Judiciary Committee as it drafted and approved two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump . Now , it appears his work is only halfway done . Speaker Nancy Pelosi chose Nadler on Wednesday to serve on the team of lawmakers who will prosecute the case against Trump in the Senate . He will work alongside Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California , the chairman of the Intelligence Committee , who oversaw the House 's Ukraine investigation , and five other managers . If Schiff 's fact-finding formed the basis for Trump 's impeachment -- he uncovered a campaign by the president to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals -- Nadler 's work provided the legal and constitutional case that Trump 's misconduct rose to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors . He is likely to play a similar role in the Senate 's proceeding , laying out for lawmakers why the president should be removed . Nadler , 72 , is the son of a chicken farmer . He has represented the West Side of Manhattan since the 1990s and built a reputation as a loquacious defender of civil liberties . That position , and Nadler 's fierce opposition to a proposed Trump Organization redevelopment project , earned the Democratic congressman the early ire of Trump , then merely a tabloid-famous New York real estate developer . But as chairman of the Judiciary Committee , Nadler has arguably been a bigger thorn in the president 's side . The famously partisan panel has aggressively pursued investigations of Trump 's immigration policies and of possible abuses by Trump around the special counsel 's Russia investigation . Before the Ukraine matter emerged this fall , Nadler spent months trying to build an impeachment case based on the findings of Robert Mueller 's report on Russian election interference and possible obstruction of justice by Trump . The push won him acclaim from liberals but chafed Pelosi , who conspicuously second-guessed some of his decisions to colleagues . As a manager , Nadler brings with him a team of lawyers who were integral to the House 's impeachment proceedings , including Barry Berke , a veteran white-collar defense lawyer , and Norman L. Eisen , a former White House ethics czar and well-known liberal watchdog . Nadler is no newcomer to impeachment . As a younger man , he earned a national reputation for his unapologetic defense of President Bill Clinton when he faced impeachment in 1998 . This fall , Republicans delighted in throwing Nadler 's dire warnings about a partisan impeachment back in his face as the chairman marched ahead to press charges against Trump . `` The American people are watching , and they wo n't forget , '' he said 21 years ago . `` You may have the votes , you may have the muscle , but you lack the legitimacy of a national consensus and the Constitution . This partisan coup d'\u00e9tat will go down in the history of this nation in infamy . '' -- Nicholas Fandos Jason Crow : Pressed to launch inquiry As a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan , Rep. Jason Crow , who flipped a Republican-held seat in 2018 , has quickly emerged in the Democratic caucus as a leading voice on national security . Drawing on those credentials and his experience as a litigator , Speaker Nancy Pelosi named the Colorado Democrat as an impeachment manager on Wednesday , selecting him as part of the team of lawmakers who will play a high-profile role prosecuting House Democrats ' case against President Donald Trump in the Senate trial . Crow is a first-term lawmaker -- one of only two among a seven-person manager team -- and he does not serve on any of the committees that have been leading the impeachment inquiry . So his selection to play a high-profile role in the impeachment trial underscores the crucial role national security-minded freshmen have played in the House investigation . Crow was among a group of seven freshmen from conservative-leaning districts -- all veterans or former intelligence analysts -- who wrote an op-ed urging Congress to impeach Trump if the allegations were true that he withheld military aid to Ukraine as part of an attempt to get the country to investigate his political rivals . The piece was seen by many as a crucial development that encouraged Democratic lawmakers by indicating they had enough backing -- including among their politically vulnerable colleagues -- to press ahead and open an inquiry into the president . `` He allegedly sought to use the very security assistance dollars appropriated by Congress to create stability in the world , to help root out corruption and to protect our national security interests , for his own personal gain , '' Crow and his colleagues wrote . `` These allegations are stunning , both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent . '' While Crow is best known for his advocacy on gun safety measures and his service in the Army , where he was honored with the Bronze Star , he worked as a litigator after his tours in Iraq and Afghanistan , specializing in white-collar defense and government investigations . He has since emerged as one of the most outspoken freshmen from a swing district urging the House to take on Trump . `` If Congress does n't stand up to these abuses , then our system of checks and balances will have failed , '' Crow said shortly after announcing he would support the impeachment inquiry . `` It 's clear that we must respond with the full weight of Congress . '' -- Catie Edmondson Sylvia Garcia : A lawyer and former judge Rep. Sylvia R. Garcia , a freshman Democrat who was named Wednesday as a House impeachment manager , made history last year when she was sworn in as one of the first two Latina congresswomen from Texas . A lawyer and former judge , she has an up-from-the-bootstraps personal story . Born in a South Texas farming community , the eighth of 10 children , Garcia `` saw her parents struggle to raise her and her siblings , '' her website says , adding that her parents `` taught her that with hard work and a good education she could accomplish anything . '' She attended Texas Woman 's University on a scholarship , graduated with a degree in social work and political science , and went on to obtain her law degree from Texas Southern University . She served as the presiding judge of the Houston Municipal System and was later elected city controller , then served in the Texas Senate . Elected to the House of Representatives in 2018 , she became a member of the Judiciary Committee and a fierce critic of the president . On Wednesday , she said on Twitter she was `` honored '' to have been chosen to be on the team of impeachment managers . `` I take my responsibility seriously because we 're working to defend our Constitution at a pivotal moment in our democracy , '' she said .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrCJqWo", "title": "Meet the impeachment managers : Nancy Pelosi taps a diverse team with legal credentials to prosecute the case against Trump", "content": "All but one of them come with legal experience , whether gleaned from evening law courses or honed while winning the conviction of an FBI agent who was seduced by a Soviet spy and traded secrets for cash and gold . Two have served in Congress for more than a quarter-century , while another two have just finished their first year there . In selecting the seven lawmakers who will serve as managers of the impeachment case against President Donald Trump , Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California turned to a diverse team from her Democratic caucus with an array of litigation credentials . Its task , which officially began on Wednesday as the House voted to appoint them , is to prosecute the case for removal of a president in only the third such trial in American history . `` The emphasis is on comfort level in the courtroom , '' Pelosi said Wednesday at a news conference to announce her choices , hours before the House voted to ratify them . `` The emphasis is making the strongest possible case to protect and defend our Constitution , to seek the truth for the American people . '' The group also reflects the historic diversity of the House Democrats , with two African Americans , a Latina and three women . `` The gorgeous mosaic of the House Democratic caucus is represented by its racial , its gender , its regional , its ideological and its religious diversity , '' said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York , who with the other managers flanked Pelosi at her news conference Wednesday morning in a studio in the Capitol . `` That is what we saw onstage . '' It offered a vivid contrast with the group of managers who prosecuted President Bill Clinton during the Senate 's last impeachment trial in 1999 , a team of 13 white men . House Democrats formally hand off articles of impeachment against President Trump to Senate : ` Today we will make history ' '' Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , which led the investigation into charges that Trump pressured Ukraine to help his reelection campaign , will be the lead prosecutor . Schiff and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , were unsurprising choices to present the case against Trump , given their public roles in the inquiry and drafting of impeachment articles . And on Wednesday , it fell to Nadler , who earned his law degree by attending evening courses while serving in the New York state Assembly , to oversee Wednesday 's debate on the resolution that formally approved the impeachment managers , allowing the articles of impeachment to be sent to the Senate . Behind him sat Pelosi , Schiff and the other managers : Jeffries , Reps. Val B. Demings of Florida , Jason Crow of Colorado , Zoe Lofgren of California and Sylvia R. Garcia of Texas . Lofgren is the sole House Democrat to have participated in the past three presidential impeachment processes , having worked as a committee aide during the proceedings against Richard M. Nixon and served on the Judiciary Committee during the impeachment of Bill Clinton . And while Demings does not have a formal background as a lawyer , she was the first woman to be police chief of Orlando , Florida , and sits on both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees , giving her a prominent perch to participate in the impeachment inquiry . The two freshmen lawmakers named to the group , Garcia and Crow , both bring critical perspectives for the arguments to remove Trump . Garcia , one of the first two Latina women to represent Texas in Congress , is a former judge , while Crow , a former Army ranger and litigator , is considered an authority on national security matters , which are at the heart of the Democratic argument for Trump 's removal . And Schiff , a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles who secured the conviction against the FBI agent , won his seat by defeating James E. Rogan , a Republican who had served as an impeachment manager in the 1999 Clinton trial . In a quirk of history , Rogan 's predecessor had also worked on an impeachment inquiry , into the Watergate break-in that led to Nixon 's resignation . Pelosi began conducting individual meetings with lawmakers this month to gauge their interest in the role of manager , according to a person familiar with the meetings but not authorized to discuss them publicly . She called most of the group on Tuesday to inform them of their selection , and then met with the full group privately Wednesday morning . `` This is all about protecting the Constitution , '' Demings told reporters as she left the news conference . `` I 've taken four oaths in my lifetime -- two as a law enforcement officer and two here -- and I take them very , very seriously . '' With only two presidential impeachment trials to serve as a guide , it is up to the group of seven to determine how they will divide the responsibilities . During the Clinton trial , lawmakers spent their two-week holiday break carefully drafting speeches and arguments , splitting up the delivery of opening and closing arguments as well as a breakdown of the articles of impeachment themselves . This group has far less time to prepare , with opening arguments likely to begin next week . The managers huddled behind closed doors Wednesday afternoon , but most lawmakers would not say what they discussed . When asked how the work would be divided among the seven , Nadler answered , `` Appropriately . '' Hours later , the managers flanked Pelosi as she used a handful of pens to formally sign the articles of impeachment . They then marched through the Capitol Rotunda to the Senate chamber , arriving at the ornately decorated double doors to deliver the charges they will soon argue against the president . Zoe Lofgren : A veteran of two impeachment inquiries When it comes to impeachment , Rep. Zoe Lofgren , D-Calif. , is arguably the institutional memory for Congress . She was a member of the House Judiciary Committee in 1998 when it approved articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton for lying about an affair with a White House intern . And as a young law student in 1974 , she helped the committee draft its Watergate charges against President Richard Nixon . Now -- 46 years after the Nixon case -- the 72-year-old lawmaker will take a high-profile role in the nation 's third impeachment trial , serving as one of the managers who will prosecute the House 's case against President Donald Trump in the Senate . For Speaker Nancy Pelosi , the decision to pick Lofgren puts a seasoned , even-tempered ally on the small team of lawmakers whose arguments during the Senate proceedings will be closely scrutinized by other lawmakers , the news media and -- perhaps most importantly -- voters in an election year . Unlike many members of the Judiciary Committee , Lofgren resisted calling for the impeachment of Trump for efforts to obstruct the two-year investigation by Robert Mueller , the special counsel , into Russia 's interference in the 2016 election . After Mueller presented his report detailing 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president , she said that Democrats had not proven that charge to the American people . `` In retrospect , it probably was a mistake '' to have relied on Mueller 's investigation , she said later . But Lofgren embraced impeachment over the revelations about Trump 's efforts to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rivals . And now , Pelosi is counting on her to bring decades of historical perspective to the arguments she and the other managers will make during the trial . Lofgren was raised in the Silicon Valley suburbs of San Francisco , the daughter of a school-cafeteria cook and a beer-truck driver . As an undergraduate student at Stanford University , she worked as an intern for Rep. Don Edwards , a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee , whom she replaced when he retired in 1995 . Now a senior member of Judiciary Committee , she is something of a temperate outlier on a panel that is known for attracting the most fiery , outspoken and partisan lawmakers . When constitutional scholars testified before the committee last year , Lofgren brought the official , 528-page record of the Nixon impeachment case . She said she had taken it out again to better understand what the founders meant by setting the standard of `` high crimes and misdemeanors '' for impeachment . -- Michael D. Shear Hakeem Jeffries : The Democrats ' messaging guru Standing on the House floor hours before voting to impeach President Donald Trump , Rep. Hakeem Jeffries issued a characteristically quotable pledge . `` We will impeach Donald John Trump , '' said Jeffries , D-N.Y. `` We will clarify that , in America , no one is above the law . '' Having already made good on the first prong of his vow , he will take up the second in the coming weeks as one of the impeachment managers who will prosecute House Democrats ' case against Trump at trial in the Senate . Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's decision to elevate him to the sought-after role is a sign of her trust in Jeffries , who as the No. 5 House Democrat is the highest-ranked member of leadership to be included on the team . Jeffries , 48 , is openly ambitious and is regarded by many Democrats as poised to become the first black speaker of the House when Pelosi steps aside . Elected in November as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus , Jeffries , of Brooklyn , has emerged as one of the Democrats ' top messaging lieutenants , letting acidic rebukes of the president and Republicans roll off his tongue even as he seeks to focus attention on the caucus ' legislative priorities . `` We must hold this president accountable for his stunning abuse of power , '' Jeffries said as the House Judiciary Committee debated the articles of impeachment . `` We must hold this president accountable for undermining America 's national security . We must impeach this president . '' Jeffries has shown few signs of tempering that approach . When a reporter on Tuesday asked him about comments made by Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California , the Republican leader , suggesting former Vice President Joe Biden should suspend his presidential campaign during the Senate trial , Jeffries deadpanned , `` Who ? '' `` We will not take political advice from Kevin McCarthy , '' he replied icily . As likely to quote from the Bible as he is from 1990s hip-hop lyrics , Jeffries ' rhetorical skills were honed as a high-powered litigator working at an elite corporate law firm in New York , where he defended CBS in a lawsuit over Janet Jackson 's wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl . Jeffries won his first race in 2006 , securing a seat in the New York State Assembly after two unsuccessful attempts . He was elected to Congress in 2012 . -- Catie Edmondson Val Demings : Offers law enforcement experience As one of the newer members of the House Intelligence Committee , Rep. Val B. Demings , D-Fla. , was one of the last to question Robert Mueller , the special counsel , during the seven-hour hearing in July on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election . But it was a question from Demings about President Donald Trump 's written answers to the inquiry that elicited a rare and striking concession outside the contents of Mueller 's report . When she asked whether the president 's `` answers showed that he was n't always being truthful , '' Mueller appeared to agree : `` I would say generally . '' It is that approach to questioning , coupled with her experience on both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees , that helped propel Demings , in only her second term in Congress , to the role of impeachment manager nearly six months after that exchange . She participated in both the public hearings into the allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine for assistance in his reelection campaign and the committee work on the two articles of impeachment that passed the House last month . `` I 've taken four oaths in my lifetime , two as a law enforcement officer and two now as a member of Congress , '' she said in December . `` Each oath stated that I will protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic . '' `` I 've enforced the laws and now I write the laws , '' she added . `` And I know that nobody is above the law . '' Demings , 62 , grew up in Jacksonville , Florida , where she shared a two-room home with her six older siblings and her parents , Elouise , a maid , and James , a janitor . After attending segregated schools , she became the first in her family to graduate college , with a criminology degree from Florida State University . `` I believe in the promise of America because I 've seen the promise of America , '' Demings said at that December hearing . She went on to join the Orlando , Fla. , Police Department , becoming its first female chief in 2007 . After serving on the force for 27 years , she retired in 2011 . The next year , she narrowly lost a race for the House of Representatives . In 2014 , she passed on a congressional rematch to run for mayor of Orange County , home to Orlando , before later withdrawing from that race . In 2016 , she won her congressional seat .

On Jan. 5 , Ofc . Imarie Waller , age 25 , was accused by another youth corrections officer who claimed to see `` sexually inappropriate '' Snapchat messages with photos between her and the 18-year-old parolee who is on release status under the Arizona Department of Juvenile Corrections . Court documents claim the officer who made the accusations said Waller and the parolee were in a relationship . The accusations led to a warranted search of Waller 's phone , where investigators allegedly found several nude pictures . On Jan. 9 , when the parolee was interviewed by investigators at his group home in Phoenix , he reportedly said he had sex with Waller at the place he lived . During a parole search of the parolee 's room and phone , an officer and investigator found naked pictures of Waller , court documents say . Later that day , around 8:00 a.m. , one of the investigators located Waller at the Adobe 's Secure Care Facility in Phoenix and gave her a search warrant while interviewing her about her relationship with the parolee . About an hour later , the investigator retrieved Waller 's phone and found sexually explicit pictures and videos of the parolee and Waller on it . During interviews with investigators , court documents say , Waller admitted to having consensual unprotected sex with the parolee . She added it was never in the Adobe 's facility . When asked where , when and how many times she had sex with the parolee , Waller reportedly kept saying she `` f __ ked up . '' In the middle of the interview , Waller went to the bathroom for a few minutes .

Two have served in Congress for more than a quarter-century , while another two have just finished their first year there . In selecting the seven lawmakers who will serve as managers of the impeachment case against President Donald Trump , Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California turned to a diverse team from her Democratic caucus with an array of litigation credentials . Its task , which officially began on Wednesday as the House voted to appoint them , is to prosecute the case for removal of a president in only the third such trial in American history . `` The emphasis is on comfort level in the courtroom , '' Pelosi said Wednesday at a news conference to announce her choices , hours before the House voted to ratify them . `` The emphasis is making the strongest possible case to protect and defend our Constitution , to seek the truth for the American people . '' The group also reflects the historic diversity of the House Democrats , with two African Americans , a Latina and three women . `` The gorgeous mosaic of the House Democratic caucus is represented by its racial , its gender , its regional , its ideological and its religious diversity , '' said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York , who with the other managers flanked Pelosi at her news conference Wednesday morning in a studio in the Capitol . `` That is what we saw onstage . '' It offered a vivid contrast with the group of managers who prosecuted President Bill Clinton during the Senate 's last impeachment trial in 1999 , a team of 13 white men . House Democrats formally hand off articles of impeachment against President Trump to Senate : ` Today we will make history ' '' Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , which led the investigation into charges that Trump pressured Ukraine to help his reelection campaign , will be the lead prosecutor . Schiff and Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , were unsurprising choices to present the case against Trump , given their public roles in the inquiry and drafting of impeachment articles . And on Wednesday , it fell to Nadler , who earned his law degree by attending evening courses while serving in the New York state Assembly , to oversee Wednesday 's debate on the resolution that formally approved the impeachment managers , allowing the articles of impeachment to be sent to the Senate . Behind him sat Pelosi , Schiff and the other managers : Jeffries , Reps. Val B. Demings of Florida , Jason Crow of Colorado , Zoe Lofgren of California and Sylvia R. Garcia of Texas . Lofgren is the sole House Democrat to have participated in the past three presidential impeachment processes , having worked as a committee aide during the proceedings against Richard M. Nixon and served on the Judiciary Committee during the impeachment of Bill Clinton . And while Demings does not have a formal background as a lawyer , she was the first woman to be police chief of Orlando , Florida , and sits on both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees , giving her a prominent perch to participate in the impeachment inquiry . The two freshmen lawmakers named to the group , Garcia and Crow , both bring critical perspectives for the arguments to remove Trump . Garcia , one of the first two Latina women to represent Texas in Congress , is a former judge , while Crow , a former Army ranger and litigator , is considered an authority on national security matters , which are at the heart of the Democratic argument for Trump 's removal . And Schiff , a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles who secured the conviction against the FBI agent , won his seat by defeating James E. Rogan , a Republican who had served as an impeachment manager in the 1999 Clinton trial . In a quirk of history , Rogan 's predecessor had also worked on an impeachment inquiry , into the Watergate break-in that led to Nixon 's resignation . Pelosi began conducting individual meetings with lawmakers this month to gauge their interest in the role of manager , according to a person familiar with the meetings but not authorized to discuss them publicly . She called most of the group on Tuesday to inform them of their selection , and then met with the full group privately Wednesday morning . `` This is all about protecting the Constitution , '' Demings told reporters as she left the news conference . `` I 've taken four oaths in my lifetime -- two as a law enforcement officer and two here -- and I take them very , very seriously . '' With only two presidential impeachment trials to serve as a guide , it is up to the group of seven to determine how they will divide the responsibilities . During the Clinton trial , lawmakers spent their two-week holiday break carefully drafting speeches and arguments , splitting up the delivery of opening and closing arguments as well as a breakdown of the articles of impeachment themselves . This group has far less time to prepare , with opening arguments likely to begin next week . The managers huddled behind closed doors Wednesday afternoon , but most lawmakers would not say what they discussed . When asked how the work would be divided among the seven , Nadler answered , `` Appropriately . '' Hours later , the managers flanked Pelosi as she used a handful of pens to formally sign the articles of impeachment . They then marched through the Capitol Rotunda to the Senate chamber , arriving at the ornately decorated double doors to deliver the charges they will soon argue against the president . Zoe Lofgren : A veteran of two impeachment inquiries When it comes to impeachment , Rep. Zoe Lofgren , D-Calif. , is arguably the institutional memory for Congress . She was a member of the House Judiciary Committee in 1998 when it approved articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton for lying about an affair with a White House intern . And as a young law student in 1974 , she helped the committee draft its Watergate charges against President Richard Nixon . Now -- 46 years after the Nixon case -- the 72-year-old lawmaker will take a high-profile role in the nation 's third impeachment trial , serving as one of the managers who will prosecute the House 's case against President Donald Trump in the Senate . For Speaker Nancy Pelosi , the decision to pick Lofgren puts a seasoned , even-tempered ally on the small team of lawmakers whose arguments during the Senate proceedings will be closely scrutinized by other lawmakers , the news media and -- perhaps most importantly -- voters in an election year . Unlike many members of the Judiciary Committee , Lofgren resisted calling for the impeachment of Trump for efforts to obstruct the two-year investigation by Robert Mueller , the special counsel , into Russia 's interference in the 2016 election . After Mueller presented his report detailing 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president , she said that Democrats had not proven that charge to the American people . `` In retrospect , it probably was a mistake '' to have relied on Mueller 's investigation , she said later . But Lofgren embraced impeachment over the revelations about Trump 's efforts to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rivals . And now , Pelosi is counting on her to bring decades of historical perspective to the arguments she and the other managers will make during the trial . Lofgren was raised in the Silicon Valley suburbs of San Francisco , the daughter of a school-cafeteria cook and a beer-truck driver . As an undergraduate student at Stanford University , she worked as an intern for Rep. Don Edwards , a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee , whom she replaced when he retired in 1995 . Now a senior member of Judiciary Committee , she is something of a temperate outlier on a panel that is known for attracting the most fiery , outspoken and partisan lawmakers . When constitutional scholars testified before the committee last year , Lofgren brought the official , 528-page record of the Nixon impeachment case . She said she had taken it out again to better understand what the founders meant by setting the standard of `` high crimes and misdemeanors '' for impeachment . -- Michael D. Shear Hakeem Jeffries : The Democrats ' messaging guru Standing on the House floor hours before voting to impeach President Donald Trump , Rep. Hakeem Jeffries issued a characteristically quotable pledge . `` We will impeach Donald John Trump , '' said Jeffries , D-N.Y. `` We will clarify that , in America , no one is above the law . '' Having already made good on the first prong of his vow , he will take up the second in the coming weeks as one of the impeachment managers who will prosecute House Democrats ' case against Trump at trial in the Senate . Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's decision to elevate him to the sought-after role is a sign of her trust in Jeffries , who as the No. 5 House Democrat is the highest-ranked member of leadership to be included on the team . Jeffries , 48 , is openly ambitious and is regarded by many Democrats as poised to become the first black speaker of the House when Pelosi steps aside . Elected in November as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus , Jeffries , of Brooklyn , has emerged as one of the Democrats ' top messaging lieutenants , letting acidic rebukes of the president and Republicans roll off his tongue even as he seeks to focus attention on the caucus ' legislative priorities . `` We must hold this president accountable for his stunning abuse of power , '' Jeffries said as the House Judiciary Committee debated the articles of impeachment . `` We must hold this president accountable for undermining America 's national security . We must impeach this president . '' Jeffries has shown few signs of tempering that approach . When a reporter on Tuesday asked him about comments made by Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California , the Republican leader , suggesting former Vice President Joe Biden should suspend his presidential campaign during the Senate trial , Jeffries deadpanned , `` Who ? '' `` We will not take political advice from Kevin McCarthy , '' he replied icily . As likely to quote from the Bible as he is from 1990s hip-hop lyrics , Jeffries ' rhetorical skills were honed as a high-powered litigator working at an elite corporate law firm in New York , where he defended CBS in a lawsuit over Janet Jackson 's wardrobe malfunction at the 2004 Super Bowl . Jeffries won his first race in 2006 , securing a seat in the New York State Assembly after two unsuccessful attempts . He was elected to Congress in 2012 . -- Catie Edmondson Val Demings : Offers law enforcement experience As one of the newer members of the House Intelligence Committee , Rep. Val B. Demings , D-Fla. , was one of the last to question Robert Mueller , the special counsel , during the seven-hour hearing in July on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election . But it was a question from Demings about President Donald Trump 's written answers to the inquiry that elicited a rare and striking concession outside the contents of Mueller 's report . When she asked whether the president 's `` answers showed that he was n't always being truthful , '' Mueller appeared to agree : `` I would say generally . '' It is that approach to questioning , coupled with her experience on both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees , that helped propel Demings , in only her second term in Congress , to the role of impeachment manager nearly six months after that exchange . She participated in both the public hearings into the allegations that Trump pressured Ukraine for assistance in his reelection campaign and the committee work on the two articles of impeachment that passed the House last month . `` I 've taken four oaths in my lifetime , two as a law enforcement officer and two now as a member of Congress , '' she said in December . `` Each oath stated that I will protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic . '' `` I 've enforced the laws and now I write the laws , '' she added . `` And I know that nobody is above the law . '' Demings , 62 , grew up in Jacksonville , Florida , where she shared a two-room home with her six older siblings and her parents , Elouise , a maid , and James , a janitor . After attending segregated schools , she became the first in her family to graduate college , with a criminology degree from Florida State University . `` I believe in the promise of America because I 've seen the promise of America , '' Demings said at that December hearing . She went on to join the Orlando , Fla. , Police Department , becoming its first female chief in 2007 . After serving on the force for 27 years , she retired in 2011 . The next year , she narrowly lost a race for the House of Representatives . In 2014 , she passed on a congressional rematch to run for mayor of Orange County , home to Orlando , before later withdrawing from that race . In 2016 , she won her congressional seat . Demings enjoys -- in what her congressional biography calls her `` very limited free time '' -- riding her Harley-Davidson Road King Classic motorcycle . -- Emily Cochrane Adam Schiff : Brings experience and controversy As a young federal prosecutor in Los Angeles 30 years ago , Adam B. Schiff won the conviction of an FBI agent who was seduced by a Soviet spy and traded secrets for gold and cash -- a case , he said then , `` of government misconduct and government corruption of the highest and most disturbing order . '' Schiff is now a 10th-term Democratic House member and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee , and he soon may find himself repeating that sentiment , this time as the lead House manager in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump . His selection by Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hardly a surprise . A fellow Californian , Schiff , 59 , first began digging into the accusations that gave rise to the impeachment inquiry when he pushed for the disclosure to Congress of a whistleblower complaint related to Trump that the administration was refusing to share . Once that complaint came out , alleging a scheme by the president to enlist Ukraine to help him in the 2020 election , Schiff led the investigation that resulted in the president 's impeachment for pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals . Strait-laced and slightly nerdy , Schiff tightly controlled the divisive process . When Rep. Matt Gaetz , R-Fla. , muscled his way into a closed-door hearing without invitation , Schiff calmly told him to `` absent yourself . '' When two dozen Republicans stormed the secure hearing room , accusing Schiff of running a secret `` Soviet-style process , '' he suspended the session rather than create the spectacle of having his colleagues removed by Capitol Police . `` He 's a full package , '' Pelosi said in an interview last fall , adding : `` He knows his purpose . He knows his subject . He always thinks strategically , and he respectfully connects with people . '' Republicans revile Schiff and have jumped on him for , among other things , dramatizing a telephone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine . Trump calls him `` Little Pencil Neck '' and `` Shifty Schiff . '' A lawyer educated at Stanford University and Harvard Law School , Schiff won a seat in the California Senate in 1996 ; in 2000 , he was elected to the House by beating a Republican incumbent , James Rogan , who -- in a curious twist -- had been a manager in the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton . Schiff makes no secret of his disdain for the president . In an interview in October , he called Trump `` infantile '' and said he had brought `` ill repute to the office '' of the presidency . -- Sheryl Gay Stolberg Jerrold Nadler : Will tie case to Constitution When Rep. Jerrold Nadler campaigned two years ago to be the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee , he billed himself as the `` strongest member to lead a potential impeachment . '' Nadler got the job , and last December , he led the Judiciary Committee as it drafted and approved two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump . Now , it appears his work is only halfway done . Speaker Nancy Pelosi chose Nadler on Wednesday to serve on the team of lawmakers who will prosecute the case against Trump in the Senate . He will work alongside Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California , the chairman of the Intelligence Committee , who oversaw the House 's Ukraine investigation , and five other managers . If Schiff 's fact-finding formed the basis for Trump 's impeachment -- he uncovered a campaign by the president to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals -- Nadler 's work provided the legal and constitutional case that Trump 's misconduct rose to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors . He is likely to play a similar role in the Senate 's proceeding , laying out for lawmakers why the president should be removed . Nadler , 72 , is the son of a chicken farmer . He has represented the West Side of Manhattan since the 1990s and built a reputation as a loquacious defender of civil liberties . That position , and Nadler 's fierce opposition to a proposed Trump Organization redevelopment project , earned the Democratic congressman the early ire of Trump , then merely a tabloid-famous New York real estate developer . But as chairman of the Judiciary Committee , Nadler has arguably been a bigger thorn in the president 's side . The famously partisan panel has aggressively pursued investigations of Trump 's immigration policies and of possible abuses by Trump around the special counsel 's Russia investigation . Before the Ukraine matter emerged this fall , Nadler spent months trying to build an impeachment case based on the findings of Robert Mueller 's report on Russian election interference and possible obstruction of justice by Trump . The push won him acclaim from liberals but chafed Pelosi , who conspicuously second-guessed some of his decisions to colleagues . As a manager , Nadler brings with him a team of lawyers who were integral to the House 's impeachment proceedings , including Barry Berke , a veteran white-collar defense lawyer , and Norman L. Eisen , a former White House ethics czar and well-known liberal watchdog . Nadler is no newcomer to impeachment . As a younger man , he earned a national reputation for his unapologetic defense of President Bill Clinton when he faced impeachment in 1998 . This fall , Republicans delighted in throwing Nadler 's dire warnings about a partisan impeachment back in his face as the chairman marched ahead to press charges against Trump . `` The American people are watching , and they wo n't forget , '' he said 21 years ago . `` You may have the votes , you may have the muscle , but you lack the legitimacy of a national consensus and the Constitution . This partisan coup d'\u00e9tat will go down in the history of this nation in infamy . '' -- Nicholas Fandos Jason Crow : Pressed to launch inquiry As a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan , Rep. Jason Crow , who flipped a Republican-held seat in 2018 , has quickly emerged in the Democratic caucus as a leading voice on national security . Drawing on those credentials and his experience as a litigator , Speaker Nancy Pelosi named the Colorado Democrat as an impeachment manager on Wednesday , selecting him as part of the team of lawmakers who will play a high-profile role prosecuting House Democrats ' case against President Donald Trump in the Senate trial . Crow is a first-term lawmaker -- one of only two among a seven-person manager team -- and he does not serve on any of the committees that have been leading the impeachment inquiry . So his selection to play a high-profile role in the impeachment trial underscores the crucial role national security-minded freshmen have played in the House investigation . Crow was among a group of seven freshmen from conservative-leaning districts -- all veterans or former intelligence analysts -- who wrote an op-ed urging Congress to impeach Trump if the allegations were true that he withheld military aid to Ukraine as part of an attempt to get the country to investigate his political rivals . The piece was seen by many as a crucial development that encouraged Democratic lawmakers by indicating they had enough backing -- including among their politically vulnerable colleagues -- to press ahead and open an inquiry into the president . `` He allegedly sought to use the very security assistance dollars appropriated by Congress to create stability in the world , to help root out corruption and to protect our national security interests , for his own personal gain , '' Crow and his colleagues wrote . `` These allegations are stunning , both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent . '' While Crow is best known for his advocacy on gun safety measures and his service in the Army , where he was honored with the Bronze Star , he worked as a litigator after his tours in Iraq and Afghanistan , specializing in white-collar defense and government investigations . He has since emerged as one of the most outspoken freshmen from a swing district urging the House to take on Trump . `` If Congress does n't stand up to these abuses , then our system of checks and balances will have failed , '' Crow said shortly after announcing he would support the impeachment inquiry . `` It 's clear that we must respond with the full weight of Congress . '' -- Catie Edmondson Sylvia Garcia : A lawyer and former judge Rep. Sylvia R. Garcia , a freshman Democrat who was named Wednesday as a House impeachment manager , made history last year when she was sworn in as one of the first two Latina congresswomen from Texas . A lawyer and former judge , she has an up-from-the-bootstraps personal story . Born in a South Texas farming community , the eighth of 10 children , Garcia `` saw her parents struggle to raise her and her siblings , '' her website says , adding that her parents `` taught her that with hard work and a good education she could accomplish anything . '' She attended Texas Woman 's University on a scholarship , graduated with a degree in social work and political science , and went on to obtain her law degree from Texas Southern University . She served as the presiding judge of the Houston Municipal System and was later elected city controller , then served in the Texas Senate . Elected to the House of Representatives in 2018 , she became a member of the Judiciary Committee and a fierce critic of the president . On Wednesday , she said on Twitter she was `` honored '' to have been chosen to be on the team of impeachment managers . `` I take my responsibility seriously because we 're working to defend our Constitution at a pivotal moment in our democracy , '' she said . Hours earlier , before her selection had been announced , she appeared to preview a central plank of the group 's case against the president . `` Trump is a clear and present danger to our democracy , and he must be held accountable , '' she wrote on Twitter . -- Sheryl Gay Stolberg c. 2020 The New York Times Company", "url": "https://www.capitalgazette.com/news/nation-world/ct-nw-nyt-trump-impeachment-managers-20200116-zotoxuz34vfypocs3cidflwjxm-story.html", "kws": ["impeachment^^managers", "impeachment", "impeachment^^manager", "Speaker^^Nancy^^Pelosi", "impeachment^^articles", "Nancy^^Pelosi", "litigation^^credentials", "Pelosi^^steps", "President^^Bill^^Clinton", "Democratic^^lawmakers", "Judiciary^^Committee", "Republicans", "House^^Democrats", "lawyers", "Congress", "leadership", "government^^misconduct", "legal^^experience", "President^^Trump", "constitutional^^scholars"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Federal": 1.0000100135803223}}}

She went on to join the Orlando , Fla. , Police Department , becoming its first female chief in 2007 . After serving on the force for 27 years , she retired in 2011 . The next year , she narrowly lost a race for the House of Representatives . In 2014 , she passed on a congressional rematch to run for mayor of Orange County , home to Orlando , before later withdrawing from that race . In 2016 , she won her congressional seat . Demings enjoys -- in what her congressional biography calls her `` very limited free time '' -- riding her Harley-Davidson Road King Classic motorcycle . -- Emily Cochrane Adam Schiff : Brings experience and controversy As a young federal prosecutor in Los Angeles 30 years ago , Adam B. Schiff won the conviction of an FBI agent who was seduced by a Soviet spy and traded secrets for gold and cash -- a case , he said then , `` of government misconduct and government corruption of the highest and most disturbing order . '' Schiff is now a 10th-term Democratic House member and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee , and he soon may find himself repeating that sentiment , this time as the lead House manager in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump . His selection by Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hardly a surprise . A fellow Californian , Schiff , 59 , first began digging into the accusations that gave rise to the impeachment inquiry when he pushed for the disclosure to Congress of a whistleblower complaint related to Trump that the administration was refusing to share . Once that complaint came out , alleging a scheme by the president to enlist Ukraine to help him in the 2020 election , Schiff led the investigation that resulted in the president 's impeachment for pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals . Strait-laced and slightly nerdy , Schiff tightly controlled the divisive process . When Rep. Matt Gaetz , R-Fla. , muscled his way into a closed-door hearing without invitation , Schiff calmly told him to `` absent yourself . '' When two dozen Republicans stormed the secure hearing room , accusing Schiff of running a secret `` Soviet-style process , '' he suspended the session rather than create the spectacle of having his colleagues removed by Capitol Police . `` He 's a full package , '' Pelosi said in an interview last fall , adding : `` He knows his purpose . He knows his subject . He always thinks strategically , and he respectfully connects with people . '' Republicans revile Schiff and have jumped on him for , among other things , dramatizing a telephone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine . Trump calls him `` Little Pencil Neck '' and `` Shifty Schiff . '' A lawyer educated at Stanford University and Harvard Law School , Schiff won a seat in the California Senate in 1996 ; in 2000 , he was elected to the House by beating a Republican incumbent , James Rogan , who -- in a curious twist -- had been a manager in the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton . Schiff makes no secret of his disdain for the president . In an interview in October , he called Trump `` infantile '' and said he had brought `` ill repute to the office '' of the presidency . -- Sheryl Gay Stolberg Jerrold Nadler : Will tie case to Constitution When Rep. Jerrold Nadler campaigned two years ago to be the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee , he billed himself as the `` strongest member to lead a potential impeachment . '' Nadler got the job , and last December , he led the Judiciary Committee as it drafted and approved two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump . Now , it appears his work is only halfway done . Speaker Nancy Pelosi chose Nadler on Wednesday to serve on the team of lawmakers who will prosecute the case against Trump in the Senate . He will work alongside Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California , the chairman of the Intelligence Committee , who oversaw the House 's Ukraine investigation , and five other managers . If Schiff 's fact-finding formed the basis for Trump 's impeachment -- he uncovered a campaign by the president to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals -- Nadler 's work provided the legal and constitutional case that Trump 's misconduct rose to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors . He is likely to play a similar role in the Senate 's proceeding , laying out for lawmakers why the president should be removed . Nadler , 72 , is the son of a chicken farmer . He has represented the West Side of Manhattan since the 1990s and built a reputation as a loquacious defender of civil liberties . That position , and Nadler 's fierce opposition to a proposed Trump Organization redevelopment project , earned the Democratic congressman the early ire of Trump , then merely a tabloid-famous New York real estate developer . But as chairman of the Judiciary Committee , Nadler has arguably been a bigger thorn in the president 's side . The famously partisan panel has aggressively pursued investigations of Trump 's immigration policies and of possible abuses by Trump around the special counsel 's Russia investigation . Before the Ukraine matter emerged this fall , Nadler spent months trying to build an impeachment case based on the findings of Robert Mueller 's report on Russian election interference and possible obstruction of justice by Trump . The push won him acclaim from liberals but chafed Pelosi , who conspicuously second-guessed some of his decisions to colleagues . As a manager , Nadler brings with him a team of lawyers who were integral to the House 's impeachment proceedings , including Barry Berke , a veteran white-collar defense lawyer , and Norman L. Eisen , a former White House ethics czar and well-known liberal watchdog . Nadler is no newcomer to impeachment . As a younger man , he earned a national reputation for his unapologetic defense of President Bill Clinton when he faced impeachment in 1998 . This fall , Republicans delighted in throwing Nadler 's dire warnings about a partisan impeachment back in his face as the chairman marched ahead to press charges against Trump . `` The American people are watching , and they wo n't forget , '' he said 21 years ago . `` You may have the votes , you may have the muscle , but you lack the legitimacy of a national consensus and the Constitution . This partisan coup d'\u00e9tat will go down in the history of this nation in infamy . '' -- Nicholas Fandos Jason Crow : Pressed to launch inquiry As a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan , Rep. Jason Crow , who flipped a Republican-held seat in 2018 , has quickly emerged in the Democratic caucus as a leading voice on national security . Drawing on those credentials and his experience as a litigator , Speaker Nancy Pelosi named the Colorado Democrat as an impeachment manager on Wednesday , selecting him as part of the team of lawmakers who will play a high-profile role prosecuting House Democrats ' case against President Donald Trump in the Senate trial . Crow is a first-term lawmaker -- one of only two among a seven-person manager team -- and he does not serve on any of the committees that have been leading the impeachment inquiry . So his selection to play a high-profile role in the impeachment trial underscores the crucial role national security-minded freshmen have played in the House investigation . Crow was among a group of seven freshmen from conservative-leaning districts -- all veterans or former intelligence analysts -- who wrote an op-ed urging Congress to impeach Trump if the allegations were true that he withheld military aid to Ukraine as part of an attempt to get the country to investigate his political rivals . The piece was seen by many as a crucial development that encouraged Democratic lawmakers by indicating they had enough backing -- including among their politically vulnerable colleagues -- to press ahead and open an inquiry into the president . `` He allegedly sought to use the very security assistance dollars appropriated by Congress to create stability in the world , to help root out corruption and to protect our national security interests , for his own personal gain , '' Crow and his colleagues wrote . `` These allegations are stunning , both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent . '' While Crow is best known for his advocacy on gun safety measures and his service in the Army , where he was honored with the Bronze Star , he worked as a litigator after his tours in Iraq and Afghanistan , specializing in white-collar defense and government investigations . He has since emerged as one of the most outspoken freshmen from a swing district urging the House to take on Trump . `` If Congress does n't stand up to these abuses , then our system of checks and balances will have failed , '' Crow said shortly after announcing he would support the impeachment inquiry . `` It 's clear that we must respond with the full weight of Congress . '' -- Catie Edmondson Sylvia Garcia : A lawyer and former judge Rep. Sylvia R. Garcia , a freshman Democrat who was named Wednesday as a House impeachment manager , made history last year when she was sworn in as one of the first two Latina congresswomen from Texas . A lawyer and former judge , she has an up-from-the-bootstraps personal story . Born in a South Texas farming community , the eighth of 10 children , Garcia `` saw her parents struggle to raise her and her siblings , '' her website says , adding that her parents `` taught her that with hard work and a good education she could accomplish anything . '' She attended Texas Woman 's University on a scholarship , graduated with a degree in social work and political science , and went on to obtain her law degree from Texas Southern University . She served as the presiding judge of the Houston Municipal System and was later elected city controller , then served in the Texas Senate . Elected to the House of Representatives in 2018 , she became a member of the Judiciary Committee and a fierce critic of the president . On Wednesday , she said on Twitter she was `` honored '' to have been chosen to be on the team of impeachment managers . `` I take my responsibility seriously because we 're working to defend our Constitution at a pivotal moment in our democracy , '' she said . Hours earlier , before her selection had been announced , she appeared to preview a central plank of the group 's case against the president . `` Trump is a clear and present danger to our democracy , and he must be held accountable , '' she wrote on Twitter . -- Sheryl Gay Stolberg c. 2020 The New York Times Company", "url": "https://www.mcall.com/news/nation-world/ct-nw-nyt-trump-impeachment-managers-20200116-zotoxuz34vfypocs3cidflwjxm-story.html", "kws": ["impeachment^^managers", "impeachment", "impeachment^^manager", "Speaker^^Nancy^^Pelosi", "impeachment^^articles", "Nancy^^Pelosi", "litigation^^credentials", "Pelosi^^steps", "President^^Bill^^Clinton", "Democratic^^lawmakers", "Judiciary^^Committee", "Republicans", "House^^Democrats", "lawyers", "Congress", "leadership", "government^^misconduct", "legal^^experience", "President^^Trump", "constitutional^^scholars"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Federal": 1.0000100135803223}}}

In the last part of the drill , coach Jennifer Alexander green-lights a free-for-all for balls sitting between the teams . Players shoot at the baskets opposite each other . The team with the first player to knock down a long 3-pointer from a white strip of tape near midcourt wins . Rori Harmon does so for the white team after a few tries . The junior guard says hitting that shot in an actual game is n't all that foreign . `` Usually when I shoot it from that far , I feel like I 'm going to make it , '' Harmon said . The Cougars have been hitting a lot of shots in actual games . They beat Houston Memorial by 37 points Tuesday and are outscoring opponents by 897 points this season . Cypress Creek is off until next Tuesday 's date at Jersey Village , so it was fine Wednesday to participate in a fun drill that produced more giggles than grunts . But not many things are more fun than 28-0 . Remaining undefeated at regular season 's end would top that . And staying perfect through the final buzzer on March 7 at the Alamodome would trump all . The only undefeated Class 6A girls basketball team in Texas resides in northwest Houston . Oddly enough , the Cougars are No. 3 in the state rankings . Any 6A team in the Houston area craving statewide respect must go through the two Dallas-Fort Worth powers ranked ahead of Cypress Creek -- 24-3 Duncanville at No. 1 and 22-2 Desoto at No. 2 . Alexander first prefers to mention Atascocita or Summer Creek , among others , as Region III-6A obstacles . Harmon sees some of what Duncanville does on social media . Backcourt mate and fellow junior Kyndall Hunter knows a few girls from the team through the AAU circuit . No one bites on disrespect , however , despite the zero in the loss column . For the Cougars , it 's a superstitious practice of not getting too comfortable or looking too far ahead and even admitting to being mildly surprised at how well 2019-20 is turning out . `` Honestly , no , '' said Hunter , almost simultaneously with Harmon , on whether they foresaw 28-0 at first tip in November . `` The way we work , I 'd think so , but we did n't go into the season thinking we were going to be 28-0 . But we went into the season trying to make a statement . '' This team has made statements since Harmon and Hunter were starring as freshmen . It 's when Cypress Creek reached the state semifinals in a whirlwind year . Hunter and Harmon played against each other in middle school -- Harmon at Campbell and Bleyl in Cypress-Fairbanks ISD -- but knew they 'd end up at the same high school . They laugh about not fully understanding playoff qualification as freshmen , believing only district champions qualified for the postseason . The team did win its district in 2017-18 . Alexander remembers Harmon , at the beginning of this season , reminiscing in the weight room over that 2017-18 run , saying , ` I wan na go back . That was fun . ''' Cypress Creek did n't make the state tournament last year . It was Summer Creek 's season in Region III-6A in 2019 . Today , however , there has simply been domination for Cypress Creek . This team plays fast , scores in bunches , and dials up the defensive pressure . It scored 101 against Stratford in December . Players have in-game goals like who collects the most box-outs . Alexander says the team is constantly trying to play a perfect game , and its scores and record reflect that . Harmon is 20th and Hunter 32nd in the ESPN Class of 2021 Hoopgurlz national player rankings . They 're as good as starting backcourts get but are buoyed by Ally Haman 's senior leadership , Morgan Hill 's 6-3 athletic frame and additional experience from Taylor Jackson , who also was a freshman on that 2017-18 team . Maybe the No. 3 ranking fosters an air of disrespect , but at least someone somewhere is doing some projecting . Alexander said other coaches from other regions have been asking around for film on Cypress Creek . A handful of girls teams in recent years have flirted with or achieved what Cypress Creek is on the doorstep of realizing . North Shore and Dekaney from the Houston area both entered the state tournament 36-1 in 2016 . Duncanville finished 39-0 that year and 42-0 in 2012-13 . Dekaney finished 40-2 in 2011-12 . Cypress Woods ' 2014-15 season finished with a state title at 35-1 . There was 36-1 Cy-Fair in 2009-10 and 39-2 Cy-Fair in 2007-08 -- both state title years . Cy-Fair was one win from 40-0 in 2006-07 . Thanks to the two pairs of Ogwumike sisters at Cy-Fair and Cypress Woods , the Didi Richards era at Cypress Ranch , and Jim Stephens ' Cypress Falls run , Cypress Creek can look within its own district for moments that pushed the sport forward in the area regardless of gender . Maybe Cypress Creek 's current run will be just as impactful . `` In comparison with those teams , just to even be mentioned with those types of players and those types of people who have come through our district -- -LRB- coaches -RRB- Virginia -LRB- Flores -RRB- and Ann -LRB- Roubique -RRB- , Tresa -LRB- Hornsby -RRB- , the job that they did -- is special , '' Alexander said . `` It 's kind of an elite group when it gets to that point .

Kourt flaunted her amazing figure in a Jan. 15 photo on a boat in Sardinia . She 's seen wearing a tiny orange bikini , while sitting on the railing with her toned legs stretched out in front of her . Her enviable cleavage and hard-earned tight abs are on display , while her hair is soaking wet from a dip in the sea .

Of course , the granddaddy of them all is California with a state debt of $ 53 billion . It 's also important to know that California has a trillion dollar unfunded pension liability . New York is close behind with a $ 38,000,000 debt . Is anybody surprised to learn that 8 of the 10 highest debt states is and has been run by Democrats for many years ? Taxes in those states are forcing thousands to leave for lower or no tax states . That will make it even more difficult to address their debt . Politicians for decades have been using promises of enhanced pensions and benefits to `` buy '' votes . Democrats seem to forget that Obama doubled the nation 's debt with a string of boondoggles like Solendra , cash for clunkers , cash for appliances , free `` Obama phones . '' The list goes on and on . Not to mention all those thousands of `` shovel ready '' projects . I guess China did n't have enough shovels to sell us to get those projects moving . You do n't have to have a George Lucas-type imagination to see the train wreck coming when states like California and all the rest of the states heavily in debt and future liabilities realize they have few choices to deal with their situations when the bills come due . All options will cause severe negative reactions of the people involved . # 1 They could default on the state debt and pension obligations . # 2 They could file bankruptcy -LRB- basically same as above -RRB- # 3 They could reduce pensions and benefits radically . # 4 They could raise taxes enough to sustain their debt , driving more people to leave their states , thus reducing revenue . # 5 And one that nobody would be in favor of . Asking the federal government -LRB- you and me -RRB- to bail them out . I do n't know about you , but I do n't want a single cent of my tax money to be used to bail out a state because they showed no fiscal restraint . Bruce Gardner Waynesville Let 's aim for civility I share concerns voiced by a recent letter writer about the manner in which some contributors in the `` Opinion '' section give voice to their views . Name-calling and not-so-subtle personal attacks serve no purpose other than to inflame individuals and perhaps satisfy some deep seated personal issue . Many of the recent attacks are directed towards Mr. David Crane . Anyone who knows him and takes the time to honestly and objectively investigate the subjects he comments on would at least discover , that whether one agrees with him or not , he speaks from experience and genuine concern for our country . Whatever our political leaning , we should show respect for our fellow citizens ' right to expression . Personal attacks are unfortunate , and frankly , they are reflect the sad state of our political health . Discussing the issues would be a productive use of time . One should not be so cavalier with the freedom that some have fought and died for . Ron Morrow Lake Junaluska Anti-vaccination message is irresponsible I was flabbergasted this morning when I read the letter from published in `` Your Views . '' The writer uses utterly misleading statistics about vaccination . She argues two main points : 1 . that flu vaccine lacks efficacy ; and 2 . that flu vaccines cause serious injuries/deaths , such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome , risk of autism , and increased risk of miscarriage . She falsely claims that the CDC research publishes support for these ideas . Remember , one study does not a conclusion make ; the point of science is that results must be repeatable . While one study that was published in Vaccine did have some confusing results , the CDC , which compiles hundreds of studies on this subject , makes it clear that pregnant women should indeed be vaccinated and that there is not an increased risk of miscarriage https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/pregnant.htm . Furthermore , links between autism and vaccines -LRB- whether given to pregnant women or to children -RRB- have been researched again and again and then roundly dismissed so many times as to now be a clich\u00e9 . As far as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 : yes , a tiny proportion of people who are vaccinated can develop Guillain-Barr\u00e9 . You know what is statistically more likely to give you Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome ? The flu . And do you know what can actually make it more likely you will harm your fetus or miscarry ? The flu . https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html . I could go on -- but why ? It would be like taking up space proving that the Earth is round and revolves around the sun . Surprising results in one study do not nullify decades of evidence proving that vaccination -- for influenza , measles , and other diseases -- has been the single most efficacious medical advancement in human history . I am stunned that The Mountaineer would give any space at all , much less a lengthy column , to the dangerous claim that people should be suspicious of vaccines . Doing so is misleading and irresponsible . A dangerous B-strain influenza is killing people this year -- often younger people who might not typically be so compromised by this virus . Wash your hands , take elderberry syrup -LRB- yes -- even the NIH says it has antiviral properties -RRB- , and stay home if sick . Please , do the research and get the vaccine . Be very careful of spurious claims made by people who do not seem versed in the scientific method ... even when they appear in print in The Mountaineer . The letter-writer is acting based on scant , cherry-picked evidence rather than the very full body of thorough and acclaimed research on this topic . Leila Wheless Canton -LRB- Editor 's note : This letter was published in the same issue as one written by the Haywood County public health director . The Mountaineer does n't censor letters , but instead offers a balanced reflection of views within our community . -RRB- Patients unnecessarily exposed for surgery Sadly , many people are completely unaware that their bodies are unnecessarily exposed in numerous surgeries . Medical professionals often make surgery outcomes and results the patient 's focus . -LRB- ex : all of the cancer was removed -RRB- . Rarely discussed is the actual procedure including modesty , patients ' private parts exposed for prepping/positioning and during surgeries , and intimate procedures such as pelvic exams -LRB- common for gynecological surgeries -RRB- . With proper communication and education patients can have maximum modesty for most procedures . At many hospitals , patient gowns are routinely removed or pulled up as soon that patient enters the operating room . If a patient is not wearing surgery shorts and/or underwear the genitals will be likely exposed for surgeries such as knee replacement surgery . If a female patient does not have some type of bra or chest covering , her breasts could be unnecessarily exposed as well . One Illinois orthopedic surgeon invented a special ` Modesty Bra ' -LRB- www.Modicine.com -RRB- for female shoulder surgery patients after he received concerns from his female employee who felt uncomfortable letting him operate on her shoulder with her breasts exposed . Across the United States and for umpteen years , hospitals ' and surgery centers ' routine policies require patients remove underwear for all surgeries . This ritual was first introduced when nylon underwear could potentially cause static electricity but , was seemingly without clear medical indication . Fortunately , as of 2020 , some hospitals have changed their policies and now allow surgery patients to wear 100 percent cotton underwear or disposable underwear that do not contain metals . Check out some arguments medical professionals may use about why you can not wear underwear and how to respond at http://patientmodesty.org/underwear.aspx . This ridiculous policy should be abandoned at every hospital because it violates the patient 's dignity and serves no medical purpose for most surgeries . There are certain procedures where regular underwear can not be worn , but there are some special garments that can be used instead . Examples include : 1 . -RRB- During a colonoscopy or rectal surgery specially designed shorts can be worn exposing only part of the buttocks . A patient could also wear boxer shorts backwards . Also , a male patient could wear a jock strap to secure his male organs . 2 . -RRB- Patients who undergo hip surgery , cardiac catheterizations in the groin , cardiac bypass surgery , and other surgeries that require access to the groin can use the Covr Medical -LRB- www.covrmedical.com garments which cover the genitals but allow access to hip and groin invented by an orthopedic surgeon , Dr. Bruce Levy , who performs hip surgeries at Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minnesota . I had the privilege of meeting Dr. Levy and his wife when I went to Minnesota in June 2019 . Dr. Levy is a caring doctor who understands the importance of patient modesty . He had grown weary of seeing hip surgery patients being exposed . This inspired him to invent dignity garments . Another concern is patients who have requested a same gender team for certain intimate procedures often have their requests ignored once they are under anesthesia . For example , one lady who chose a female gynecologist from an all-female practice in Utah to do her hysterectomy was horrified to learn there were male nurses and a male anesthesiologist present against her wishes . To learn more about how you can have maximum modesty for surgeries and what steps you have to take to ensure a same gender team for certain surgeries , check out the article , Surgery and Your Modesty at http://www.patientmodesty.org/surgerymodesty.aspx and the video , Surgery and Your Modesty at www.youtube.com/patientmodesty . Misty Roberts is the president of Medical Patient Modesty , a non-profit organization that works to educate patients and their families about how to have maximum modesty for procedures and how to stand up for their rights requesting a same-gender medical team for intimate procedures .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrCXfhp", "title": "Can Men Be Denied Their ` Reproductive Rights ' ?", "content": "A new HIV + sperm bank has opened in New Zealand , with the purpose of raising awareness as to the viability of men 's reproductive issues . The anonymous donors are all HIV + , but after treatment , the amount of the virus in their blood is so imperceptible that it can not be passed down to offspring . Whether or not infertile couples will make use of this bank is still uncertain , but the questions it raises about the social uses of reproductive rights are salient . Historically , denying reproductive rights has been a brutal means of controlling portions of the population deemed unfit to breed . Margaret Sanger , founder of Planned Parenthood , wrote in 1921 that `` the most urgent problem today is how to limit and discourage the over-fertility of the mentally and physically defective . '' In the United States , the implementation of the Model Eugenic Sterilization Law resulted in the mandatory sterilization of the `` socially inadequate '' in 30 states and Puerto Rico . The forced sterilization of those with Downs Syndrome persisted through 1981 . New Zealand passed its Mental Defectives Act in 1911 , allowing the state to imprison anyone classified as mentally ill or otherwise `` defective '' for an unlimited period of time . The nurses ' journal Kai Tiaki enthusiastically noted the passing of the bill : `` By detention of many such , who out in the world would marry and perpetuate their kind , surely something will be done toward stemming the tide of race deterioration , which fills to overflowing our mental hospitals ... . '' Today , mandatory sterilization is not used for weeding out the population , but for genetic engineering purposes , the same way that gene editing procedures and selective abortions are . This allows parents and doctors the option of choosing not to pass on hereditary diseases or conditions by simply not having the child or changing its genetic composition . In Iceland , for example , use of selective abortion has resulted in the eradication of Downs Syndrome , while in 132 villages in India , there were no female babies born over a three-month period . The idea that those with specific characteristics should be encouraged to breed is the flip side of the same coin . Sperm banks tout the achievements and physical attributes of their donors , who typically are screened for diseases before their contributions are deposited . Prospective parents know what lies in donors ' genetic backgrounds . The idea behind Sperm Positive is to destigmatize HIV . But it does seem an odd way of going about it . Instead of selecting for desirable characteristics , this pre-birth genetic engineering is used for activism . Many countries , as well as 19 states , require HIV + individuals to disclose their status to partners prior to sexual intimacy . There 's been pushback against these laws over concerns that they further stigmatize those living with HIV + . Such individuals , when properly medicated , can end up with no trace of the virus in their blood , and at the point it is undetectable , they can not pass it on . Additionally , there 's been a big campaign to get people on PrEP , which is a medication that prevents them from contracting HIV . Progress is being made in the research and management of this disease . The right to reproduce is acknowledged by the World Health Organization , many national health organizations such as the National Health Service in the UK , and insurance companies in the United States , which provide coverage for fertility treatments . Those rights should certainly extend to the right to not have one reproductive life interfered with by external sources , such as government mandates of forced sterility or the encouragement of pregnancy termination to eradicate disease . But if a person 's right to reproduction depends on making use of another person 's body to make it happen , does that mean the right entitles them to a gestational body ? There are many surrogacy companies that exist just for gay couples who do not otherwise have access to the womb . The idea is that men have the right to rent a womb in order to complete their families . Surrogacy programs are global , accessing rentable women in countries around the globe . It 's possible to create a truly international child with sperm from one nation , an egg from another , and a womb from still another . Once the child is born , national origin can become a matter for the courts . It 's reasonable to assume that people have the right to conceive and have children , but only under their own power . This seeming stunt to raise awareness about the safety of medicated blood with undetectable levels of HIV gives the impression that the right to reproduce supersedes all other considerations . The science on the inability of HIV + prospective parents who have no trace of the virus in their blood to pass down the disease is sound . New Zealand moms who have conceived children after the HIV in their systems had diminished to nothing show that the illness has not been disseminated to their offspring . Then there 's this idea , taken from the FAQ for the Positive Women group in New Zealand : `` You have the right to a full and active sex life . You have the right to have children . '' These things are not rights that anyone else is responsible for . We 've heard a lot of talk over the past few years about how incels think they have a right to women 's bodies , and how insane that is . Now organizations say that HIV + individuals have a right to other people 's bodies , and are using conception as a means to destigmatize an illness . These anonymous donors speak of their interest in helping infertile couples conceive , in order to start or continue families . But it comes across as a publicity campaign to challenge the stigma . Hopefully if these men truly want to start families , they will find love in their own lives and be able to sire the children they seem so capable of fathering . Despite the science , the medical advancements , and the breaking down of barriers , it seems unlikely that , given the plethora of other options , a couple would intentionally procure sperm from an HIV + donor when there are so many other options available .

Santana and Ortiz , The Young Bucks and The Best Friends with Orange Cassidy -- Number One Contenders Match -RRB- The stage , wardrobes and Bash at the Beach theme was spot on . Not to nitpick , but I would have loved to see the ring surrounded by a sand . AEW continues to build tension between Adam Page and The Elite , this time when Page low-bridged Matt Jackson . I do n't think I 've ever seen anybody so upset after getting low-bridged . A non-tag team duo going over in a match filled with tag teams does nothing to support the notion that the losing teams are among the best in the world . Cody Accepts MJF 's Stipulations First Cody mortgaged his ability to challenge for a world title , now he 's willing to take 10 lashings to fight MJF . If there 's a bigger martyr complex in pro wrestling , I have yet to see it . Hikaru Shida and Kris Statlander def . The Nightmare Collective -LRB- Brandi Rhodes and Mel -RRB- I had no idea how much bigger Mel was than just about every non-monster on the female roster . AEW production struggled in this segment , missing the initial attack on Kris Statlander and then immediately missing Hikaru Shida 's kendo stick attack on Luther . The finish of this match featured a scary spot where Statlander essentially dropped Mel on the top of her head for a modified spike piledriver . Jon Moxley def . Sammy Guevara The Dark Order 's vignettes are actually very very good . Perhaps they should have done weeks of this before rolling them out so hastily . When AEW aired that shot of the bikini model seated stage-side , I knew it was a lock that Sammy Guevara was going to shoot his shot and he did not disappoint . After going 2-0 to start the year , Sammy Guevara is right back in the Washington Generals role as the setup guy for Chris Jericho . These two avoided certain disaster when one of Moxley 's feet slipped on the top rope while taking an overhead superplex . Chris Jericho whipped Jon Moxley with that giant AEW Championship , which may undermine whatever wimpy leather belt MJF chooses to whip Cody with . AEW is in a bit of a bind with these storylines that call for referees to get involved . When Aubrey appears , fans are distracted and start chanting for her , taking away from the angle . If they were to decide she should n't appear , fans would likely chant `` we want Aubrey , '' and we 'd be right back to Square One . Jericho had so many blind bars in his post-match promos . MJF , The Butcher and The Blade def . DDP and QT Marshall , Dustin Rhodes and DDP QT Marshall was really biting that apple like the term `` Carlito '' is n't about to start trending on Twitter . Seeing DDP in full gear on TNT felt so right . Ever since his classic WCW theme , every one of DDP 's subsequent themes has been miserable . His AEW theme clears that low bar . Jim Ross on MJF : `` A boil on the ass of life . '' There are good ways to lift from #WCW , like Bash at The Beach or Diamond Dallas Page , and there 's bad things to lift from WCW , like Hangman Page 's alcoholism storyline . PAC def . Darby Allin PAC hasbeen the quietest AEW wrestler of 2020 . Darby Allin is essentially babyface Sammy Guevara in terms of how he 's booked . Every time Darby Allin takes a bump I hold my breath , particularly on a Liger Bomb where he essentially landed on his neck . PAC won this match , which means AEW will have a resolution to PAC 's 2019 draw against Jon Moxley .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrCjzc3", "title": "Remember when Marilyn Monroe 's white cocktail dress made movie history ?", "content": "One Manhattan night in 1954 , an ivory-white cocktail dress made cinematic history when it collided with an upward breeze . That unforgettable moment , from the whimsical comedy `` The Seven Year Itch , '' had everything to do with the person wearing the dress . In Billy Wilder 's film , Marilyn Monroe stars as a guileless model who keeps her underwear in the fridge and dunks potato chips in her Champagne . A summer of flirtation with her downstairs neighbor leads to the climactic scene when , after the pair catch a movie on 52nd Street , Monroe pauses over a subway grate to savor a cool blast of air from a passing train -- `` Is n't it delicious ? '' she says in her jingling Betty Boop voice , as her dress takes flight . William Travilla , a leading costume designer for 20th Century Fox , did n't think much of the garment that became his most famous creation -- he called it `` that silly little dress . '' Travilla worked on eight of Monroe 's films , including `` How to Marry a Millionaire '' and `` Gentlemen Prefer Blondes . '' The actress adored his clingy , figure-hugging designs : `` Billy Dear , please dress me forever . I love you , '' she once wrote to him . Travilla crafted her `` Seven Year Itch '' dress from rayon-acetate crepe , a fabric heavy enough to swing as Monroe walked , but light enough to catch that all-important breeze . Bias-cut with a halter neck and sunburst pleats , a slim belt winds its way around the waist into a neat bow : '' ... cool and clean , in a dirty , dirty city , '' as Travilla described it . 14 takes In the early hours of September 15th , 1954 , Monroe stood under Klieg lights on Lexington Avenue , while a member of the crew crouched in the grill beneath her heels operating a wind-machine . A few feet away behind a police barricade , thousands of fans and press photographers jostled to catch a glimpse of the star . -LRB- `` The Russians could have invaded Manhattan and nobody would have taken any notice , '' her publicist Roy Craft later recalled . -RRB- The throng was n't quite as spontaneous as it seemed -- Fox had spread word of the impending event , counting on some free publicity . Wilder shot 14 takes -LRB- the scene was later re-shot at a studio lot in California -RRB- , while the mostly male crowd shouted `` higher '' each time a blast of wind lifted Monroe 's skirt . -LRB- She had come prepared for the gawkers in two pairs of white underwear . -RRB- If onlookers were delighted , Monroe 's then-husband , New York Yankees center fielder Joe DiMaggio , was less thrilled . In his book , Wilder described the `` look of death '' on DiMaggio 's face as he stormed off set to stew in the nearby St. Regis Hotel . Several biographers have chronicled the stormy argument that ensued in Suite 1105 when Monroe returned . It was one of many straws that allegedly ended a tumultuous marriage ; back in Los Angeles three weeks later , she announced their divorce . `` Marilyn Splits With Joe Over Sexy Pictures , '' ran the Daily News headline . Enduring legacy In the decades since the film 's release , the flirty dress has become shorthand for Monroe herself . The image has been imitated in countless fashion shoots , and used to sell cars , orange soda and even hair removing cream . Absolut vodka needed only to photograph one of their bottles on a subway grate with its label fluttering upward and the reference was clear . Modern takes on the dress have been worn onstage by Britney Spears and Nicki Minaj , in shoots with the likes of Lindsay Lohan and Madonna , and by that other famous blonde , Barbie . There have been far more X-rated homages , and multiple spoofs , most memorably Willem Dafoe 's Superbowl ad for Snickers , depicting the actor flashing hairy legs and white underpants , until a bite of the chocolate bar restores his ` Marilyn ' to her beautiful self . This year , sculptor Seward Johnson 's kitsch , stainless steel rendering of her will be permanently installed in Palm Springs , offering photo opportunities for tourists to stand beneath the 26-foot-tall Marilyn 's skirt . A similar towering sculpture was found ditched face down in a garbage dump in Guigang , China , while an image of her was even grown in a Japanese rice field . As for the original dress , it languished among William Travilla 's possessions until his death in 1990 , when the actress Debbie Reynolds picked it up for $ 200 . In 2011 Reynolds sold her collection of Hollywood memorabilia to avoid bankruptcy and the pleated dress , by now one of the most recognizable costumes in film history , fetched $ 4.6 million at auction . Its success was n't entirely due to the dress 's revealing attributes -- Travilla 's design embodied the same alchemical mix of innocence and seduction that Monroe was so masterful at projecting onto celluloid . Both angelically white and daringly audacious , it reflected the actress 's own beguiling contradictions . In Norman Mailer 's biography of the star , he wrote of Monroe 's `` The Seven Year Itch '' performance : `` It is an unbelievable performance for an actress who is on the edge of separating from her husband , has two atrocious films behind her , is in psychoanalysis , drinking too much , and all the while thinking of breaking her contract ... '' . Monroe betrayed none of that private turmoil onscreen , instead capturing the spirit of booming , 1950s American exuberance with a carefree effervescence that cemented iconic status both for herself and `` that silly little dress .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrCve2E", "title": "` Vanderpump Rules ' Jax Does n't Know Who Prince Harry Is . Stassi 's Favorite Candle Revealed !", "content": "Friends , there is no way to sugar coat this . I 'm kind of bored with season 8 already . The good times could n't last forever -- and the Vanderpump Rules crew did give us some epically good and entertaining times , in particular , one person . I 'll never forget the multiple times Jax Taylor took off his shirt to fight random dudes in various parking lots . Or how Jax stole sunglasses because that 's what you do in Hawaii on vacation . Or how Jax cheated on Stassi and then got his ass kicked out of her apartment . Jax Taylor has given us years of stellar TV -- but all good things have to end sometimes . Now that our core cast is older , -LRB- questionably -RRB- wiser , but definitely more financially stable , the stupid things they did to , and/or with , each other have simmered down . They were a thirsty group of people when we first met them seven years ago , and now that the thirst has been quenched , we 're starting to fall into a rut where the same things keep happening over and over . For example . How many times has Lala had the conversation with DJ James Kennedy like she did in this ep that he did some shitty things , but he 's forgiven now ? I feel like we get at least one a season . We 've seen the cast try comedy before , like Dayna did last night . We 've seen them get ready for a bachelorette party . We 've seen them do `` sexy '' photoshoots for their upcoming marriage -LRB- Scheana pulled this long before Brittany did it last night , because of course she did . -RRB- I do n't know , the show is getting a little stale and I 'm not sure how they can return it to a fraction of its glory from previous years . Maybe it 's time for a spin-off to follow some of the people who work at Vanderpump Cocktail Garden in Vegas ? So , what happened that was new-ish , last night ? We found out more about Dayna , her background , and why she 's in LA -LRB- to fulfill her late mother 's wish that she really make a go of trying to be a comedian . -RRB- I like Dayna , but I do n't see the attraction with Max . He seems like a sleezy dude who just wants to sleep around -- which was all but confirmed by Scheana , who gave this guy an Apple Watch for Thanksgiving . I love Scheana , I hope she never changes . Jax and Brittany went to buy their wedding rings , the highlight of which is Jax in a talking head commenting that he and Brittany are not `` Meghan Markle ... and ... whatever his name is ? '' I adore Jax , and I love him a little bit more for knowing who Meghan Markle is and not Prince Harry . This man works overtime to make sure this show is entertaining . This is why I was surprised that he was the voice of reason in his discussion with Doute about what a parasitic leech Carter is on her finances and her soul . F*ck me , Carter is gross . He is totally taking advantage of my dear Doute and I am not here for it . The sooner she gets rid of him , the better . Puke . Finally , friends , I have good news if you were like me and were very intrigued as to what Stassi 's favorite candle is , that she insisted on bringing to Katie 's home in order to make it look more feminine and smell like Stassi . I am happy to report that I spent the better part of an hour diving deep , and , well ? I 'm pretty sure I know what it is . You heard it here first , folks -- Like a psycho , I just spent 20 mins trying to decipher what Stassi 's favorite candle that she gave to Katie on #PumpRules last night , and I 'm pretty sure I found it . Tocca `` Bianca '' pic.twitter.com/z0wgHmoTJQ -- Kate Hudson -LRB- @HudsonKate -RRB- January 15 , 2020 -LRB- Apologies for the indulgence of embedding my own tweet . I 'm really proud of myself for putting on my bedazzled detective hat and finding the answer . No , I have n't ordered this candle ... yet , but I do have plans to go to the fancy pants boutique in my neighborhood today to smell it . Is that weird ? -RRB- Probably the most real part of the show came in one of the fakest set-ups . Ariana , for plot reasons , decided that she should go pull a shift or two at SUR , and had to ask Lisa for the privilege of getting her job back . The conversation morphed into something more authentic , with Ariana admitting to Lisa that she is clinically depressed , unable to get out of bed some days , and Lisa told her she can pull herself out of it like Lisa did with her own depression . Aww , Ariana . I feel for her . I know what this feels like , and her talking head where she admitted depression is something she will have to carry with her for the rest of her life hit home . I 've said those exact words at times . It 's very hard to see a way out of it when you 're in the middle of it , and I wish her the best . It can and will get better , with time and proper treatment , but enduring it in the moment is the worst . Hang in there , lady ! If you noticed a discrepancy in the way Ariana looked in that scene , you 're not alone . Here 's the example , and her explanation : not reshoots . it 's a pickup shot . -- Ariana `` Buy My Book '' Madix -LRB- @ariana2525 -RRB- January 15 , 2020 That about sums up the ep . Looks like Stassi is going to lay into Sandoval next ep , so you know I 'll be watching , and hoping that we get some classic VPR moments from that fight . Until then , friends .

The report , which is HRW 's 30th edition , reviews human rights practices in nearly 100 countries . It 's a sort of report card on a nation 's track record with human rights . Freedom of expression and peaceful assembly In the chapter on Singapore , HRW notes authorities here have used existing laws to penalise peaceful expression and protest , with activists , lawyers , and online media facing prosecution , civil defamation suits , and threats of contempt of court charges . Highlighting the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act -LRB- POFMA -RRB- , which took effect in October 2019 , deputy Asia director at HRW Phil Robertson said , `` Singapore 's long intolerance of free expression virtually ensures the online falsehoods law will be used to silence dissenters . '' `` The law 's mere existence has already led critics of the government to self-censor online . Singapore 's trading partners should tell the government that every new restraint on free expression makes the country a less hospitable place to invest and do business , '' he added . HRW took note of the case against Jolovan Wham in April when he and opposition politician John Tan were fined S$ 5,000 each for `` scandalizing the judiciary '' on social media in violation of the country 's contempt laws . HRW also highlighted Singapore 's laws which defines assembly extremely broadly . Those who fail to obtain the required permits face criminal charges . Mr Wham was also convicted in January 2019 for violating the Pubic Order Act by allowing Hong Kong citizen Joshua Wong to participate in an indoor conference via Skype without first obtaining a permit . Mr Wham was sentenced to 16 days in jail and/or a fine of S$ 3,200 . The High Court dismissed Mr Wham 's appeal in October . The report also mentioned the criminal and civil defamation charges being pursued against TOC chief editor Terry Xu for articles published on the site in relation to the Prime Minister and administration . One of the articles , published in September 2019 , included claims made against PM Lee Hsien Loong by his siblings about the saga with their father 's property . Criminal justice system In terms of Singapore 's justice system , HRW 's report notes that the country still has a death penalty which is mandated for many drug offences and certain other crimes . The report points out the lack of transparency in the timing of executions and that these often take place with short notice . The report also mentioned the execution of a Malaysian man in March despite pending petitions for clemency and another execution of a Malaysian man in November . HRW highlighted Singapore 's strong defence of the death penalty in the face of Malaysian officials calling for clemency in those cases . Ten people were notified in July 2019 that their petitions for clemency had been rejected . Sexual orientation and labour rights Next , the report points to Singapore 's continued criminalisation of homosexuality under the colonial-era law it inherited from the British , Section 377A . It also notes that the government systematically censors and severely restricts any positive media or public depiction of the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -LRB- LGBT -RRB- community . Last year , the High Court heard three constitutional challenges to 377A , which the government defended . Finally , the report also pointed to the labour issue in the country where it says foreign migrant workers face labour rights abuses and exploitation . This includes debts owed to recruitment agents , non-payment of wages , restrictions on movement , confiscation of passports , and sometimes physical and sexual abuse . HRW noted that Singapore was one of only six countries which abstained from the new International Labour Organization convention introduced in June 2019 against violence and discrimination in the workplace . The organisation also noted that Singapore is a regional hub for international business and it maintains a good political and economic relations with China and the United States , both of which consider the country a key security ally . And while the European Parliament passed a resolution in February last year over concerns about the country 's treatment of its LGBT population and ongoing restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly , few countries have publicly criticised Singapore for its poor human rights record , focusing priorities on business and trade instead .", "url": "https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2020/01/16/singapores-less-than-stellar-review-by-human-rights-watch-world-report-2020/", "kws": ["Human^^Rights^^Watch", "Singapore", "human^^rights^^practices", "review", "free^^expression^^rights", "HRW", "international^^business", "China", "reviews", "Malaysian^^officials", "Freedom^^of^^expression", "transparency", "European^^Parliament", "free^^expression", "critics", "ongoing^^restrictions", "online^^media", "Criminal^^justice^^system", "social^^media", "activists"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Society": 0.9872304201126099}, "second_cat": {"Society_Other": 0.9872304201126099}}}
0.0	{"docid": "0NrCxSJy", "title": "20 Things Wheel Of Fortune Producers Want To Keep On The DL", "content": "Wheel Of Fortune has been on air for over 30 years and Pat Sajak and Vanna White have become comfortable , familiar faces to their broad audience . The show shows no signs of slowing down , and unlike other game shows that quickly lose traction , this one seems to continue to attract fans of all ages . Like any other television show , there 's a lot that happens behind the scenes that the audience is rarely aware of . You 'll be surprised at some of the tidbits of information we were able to uncover . Let 's take a look at 20 Things Wheel Of Fortune Producers Want To Keep On The DL ... 20 Pat Sajak And Vanna White Were Usually Tipsy On Air While they certainly ca n't get away with it now , Pat Sajak and Vanna White are pretty honest about the fact that they would regularly drink before the show . According to The Delite , there 's a place across the street from their studio which makes great margaritas and Pat confessed he and Vanna would `` go across and have two or three or six and then come and do the last shows and have trouble recognizing the alphabet '' . 19 The Odds Suggest You Wo n't Ever Get On The Show It 's not a simple task to make your way onto the Wheel of Fortune set . It 's reported that millions of people apply each year and only about 10,000 or so are chosen to make it to the audition round . Sadly , there 's no security in that step forward as only 600 of those hand-selected people will actually make it onto the show . 18 They Throw Money At Pat Sajak Of course Pat Sajak is a familiar face to all of us , but very few people are aware of just how wealthy he really is . It was shocking to hear that Sajak makes a whopping $ 15 million each year from his direct pay from this show . That 's comparable to the wages paid to the hosts of late night shows such as Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert . 17 Pat And Vanna Barely Work Would n't it be nice to work for 4 days a month and make millions upon millions of dollars ? Pat Sajak and Vanna White really have the best jobs in the world because that is their actual reality . Their job description involves them coming in to work about 4 times a month or so . They shoot a total of 35 times a year . We have no idea how that 's justified or what they do with all their spare time , but we wish we could get in on this deal . 16 Pat Sajak And Vanna White Might Bail This Year The clock is ticking on their contract , folks ! Pat Sajak and Vanna White 's employment contracts are up in 2020 and rumor has it they wo n't be going back to the table to try to keep the show alive . Sajak has indicated that he 'd rather leave while the show is on a high note , and it certainly is still going strong ! 15 Vanna White Posed For A Nude Shoot Vanna White has a smear on her reputation and it involves a nude photo . Apparently when she was young , and well before the days of The Wheel Of Fortune , she posed nude in an attempt to score some rent money . These photos were eventually sold to Playboy who then published them on the cover of their May 1987 Issue , without her consent . 14 If You Want To Win , Ask For A `` T '' The Delite tells us that the most common consonant called is the letter T , so if contestants are stumped , this is a good guess to follow up with . Be careful in opting to buy the letter E though , as it is sure to be used more frequently . It 's been said that some contestants have walked off the set of this show having not paid attention to the strategy or basic common sense factors . 13 Pat Sajak Has Walked Off The Show Before There was an episode in 2014 during which the contestants began randomly guessing horse related answers for no reason . Pat Sajak was visibly upset by this and he decided he just could n't or would n't deal with it any longer . He stormed off the set with visible frustration . 12 They Used A Racist Background In 2017 , during `` Southern Charm Week '' the background image used by the show was under fire -- a lot of fire ! It appears that there are African slaves working on a plantation in the background which was offensive to many . The Executives of the school had to issue a public apology . 11 The People On The Show Are Sticklers For Accuracy There are some Wheel Of Fortune contestants out there that should have many tickets to this show in their hands . After a contestant pronounced the word `` flamenco '' as `` flamingo '' by accident , he was told the answer was incorrect and he lost out on $ 7,000 worth of winnings . What he meant was clear and many believe he should have been awarded the money . 10 Vanna White Does n't Even Turn The Letters Anymore We 're not sure what Vanna 's job actually is if she is n't the one turning the letters . The entire letterboard went digital back in 1997 , so all she has to do is make her selection by touching the letter screens ! She earns so much money for this job that we assumed there was more weight she pulled behind the scenes or something , but apparently not . 9 Vanna White Turned The Wrong Letter Once This job is so simple that it 's painful to try breaking it down . Vanna 's sole responsibility is to turn the right letters at the right times yet apparently this has been a real challenge for her . In the earlier days of this show , she turned a letter and had no idea if it was a `` D `` or an `` M '' that she had revealed . Perhaps this was one of those margarita mornings . 8 Vanna Thinks She Can Send Telepathic Messages To Contestants We know how crazy that sounds , but we swear we are n't making it up . Vanna knows better than to outright give hints to a contestant ; however , she admits that she tries to `` communicate the answers to contestants with her mind . '' She admits she has tried to telepathically send hints to her favourite contestants on a regular basis . 7 A Contestant Gave A Strange Answer And We Wo n't Soon Forget It By putting one tiny letter in place of another one , you can seriously have the power to mess up this game . Just ask a contestant by the name of `` Kevin '' who had a little minor mishap with the letter `` K. '' This resulted in `` A Streetcar Naked Desire . '' Switching the `` K '' and `` M '' are a big deal in this case ... 6 The Wheel Is Deceptively Small In Real Life The Wheel is a pretty important object on the set -- it 's the main feature in the title of the show ! Next time you tune in , you may want to be aware of the fact that the cameramen are engaged in a full-on game of trickery , as the actual wheel is only 6 feet in diameter and is teeny tiny compared to what fans would have imagined . 5 Contestants Are Subjected To Intense Training Before Taping Playing on a game show sounds like it should be a lot of fun , but apparently it 's quite a chore for the contestants of Wheel Of Fortune . There 's an entire day that has to be dedicated for coaching the contestants as to how to properly spin the wheel , and where to focus their attention , etc. . The process is far stricter than most would imagine . 4 Pat Sajak And Alex Trebek Are Definitely Not Friends So much for camaraderie and support . These two men have very similar jobs , but they opt to compete with one another and one-up each other instead of keeping the peace . There may not be any direct `` bad blood '' per se , but The Week quotes Pat as saying `` We get along fine but we 're not in the same bowling league . '' That sure does sound like a jab to us ! 3 Pat Left The Show To Do His Own Thing The producers do n't want you to know this , but the rumors are indeed true . Pat Sajak walked off the set in 1989 and had no intention of ever coming back to it . He even went on to host his own talk show which was featured as a late night show . 2 Fans Are n't Loving Vanna 's Hosting Skills In 2019 , Vanna hosted some of the episodes of Wheel Of Fortune , but the fans just did n't like her . It 's not easy to convince everyone that Vanna has what it takes to run the show without Pat Sajak next to her . Pop Culture reports a fan as saying `` Vanna seems uncomfortable as host and it 's making it awkward to watch ! 1 The Producers Stubbornly Refused To Budge And A Contestant Lost $ 1 Million Yes , we know the game show has rules , but like anything else in life , rules can sometimes be bent a tad to give a greater sense of peace and happiness , especially in cases where common sense prevails . In one episode , Julian Batts missed out on his million dollar win because he could n't pronounce the word `` Achilles . '' Everyone involved easily knew what he meant , but the producers stuck to their firm `` No , '' and that was the end of a million dollar dream .", "url": "https://www.thethings.com/wheel-of-fortune-facts-and-secrets/", "kws": ["Wheel^^Of^^Fortune", "Fortune^^Producers", "Producers", "Pat^^Sajak", "Stephen^^Colbert", "Jimmy^^Fallon", "television", "Vanna^^White", "contestants", "winnings", "Alex^^Trebek", "traction", "Playboy", "Achilles", "alphabet", "diameter", "rumor", "Pop^^Culture", "trickery", "familiar^^faces"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_TV": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_TV_ShowsPrograms": 1.0000100135803223}}}

Cube Gooding Jr. is one of those famous figures who only in recent months has amassed a startling near-two dozen accusers who have come forward with claims of sexual misconduct . Over the years , there has been video footage of a drunken Cuba at bars or parties , but some women now say those places were exactly where the accomplished actor groped or inappropriately touched them . Cuba has come forward to adamantly deny the accusations against him while the court of public opinion rakes him through the coals . Actor Michael Jai White was stunned when VladTV told him that 22 women have spoken against Cuba , but he added that his wild ways have been well-known in Hollywood for years . Vlad referenced an interview he did with comedian Lunnell who stated that when Cuba gets drunk `` he gets handsy with the women . '' Michael said he `` not surprised '' by the accusations , but `` Cuba 's a wild boy , that 's never been hidden . '' The actor added that Cuba would tell everyone that his nickname was `` Butt Naked '' because `` for 20 years he just would drop -LSB- trousers -RSB- in public . He did that a lot . '' White stressed that Cuba has called himself that , `` so that 's something nowadays is completely frowned upon , so when I say I 'm not surprised , it 's not because he 's a lecherous person . I just think people are ... They 're on a witchhunt for it , to some degree . '' White claims he 's never been drunk but he recognizes that it can cause people to do things they may regret . Because Cuba likes to drink and party , his `` wild '' antics were apart of `` how he was fun . '' Although White ca n't say anything about whether or not Cuba has crossed the line with anyone , he can say that he never heard about anyone complaining back in the day .

Sometimes , you just need to take a breather away from electronics , and what better way to do this than to focus on a hobby ? However , we all pour our passion into different things ; some love painting , others love writing , and a select few enjoy collecting playing cards . Whether you are a seasoned playing-card collector or a newbie who only has one deck , we have got you covered . You need some essentials to keep your cards in top-notch shape , impress your friends , and proudly display your collection . So , if you are ready to take your collection to the next level , here 's a list of all the essentials you should check out . IMAGE : PEXELS Card Sleeves We will kick off our list with the most obvious thing that every card enthusiast should have : card sleeves . A card sleeve is a small pocket made of plastic or similar material that will offer your card the utmost protection . We are sure that you do not want your beautiful deck to get torn or have water spilled on it ; thus , you should invest in this nifty product . You will find hundreds of various card sleeves online and in local stores . Nevertheless , if you do not find ones that appeal to you , you can customize your own at https://www.yourplaymat.com/products/custom-card-sleeves where you can get the card sleeves of your dreams . Moreover , you can personalize them even more by adding pictures or quotes that strike your fancy . This way you can protect your precious cards in style . A Card Box This product is to keep your cards all in one place . You may think that a dedicated box is unnecessary , as you can store your cards in an empty box you can find at any dollar store . Yet , most card boxes have a magnetic locking mechanism that stops the lid of the box from opening and prevents your cards from falling out of it . In addition , such boxes have dedicated slots in which you can insert your cards , and they also can carry up to 4 decks in separate slots . A Card Shuffler When you are having fun with your friends during your game night , your cards will most probably bear the brunt of your rough handling and shuffling . This is where a card shuffler enters the picture . This handy product will hold and shuffle your cards . If you are scared about the cost , then you can get a manual one whose handle you turn to shuffle the cards . On the other hand , if you want to splurge a bit on this , you might want to look into getting an automatic shuffler . Cardholders You will love these when your friendly game becomes intense and you find yourself holding too many cards at once . This is also a great idea if your palms get sweaty , and you do not want to expose your cards to moisture . Cardholders come in all shapes and sizes , but the most common ones are rack-style holders and plastic discs . Rack-style holders can be put on the table in front of you , and plastic discs enable you to hold all your cards at the same time in your hand ; some cardholders can even hold the whole deck ! Card Display Cases If you have some rare cards that you want to proudly flaunt , then you should purchase a card display case . You can put all your rare cards in it and hang it on the wall . Not only does it allow your guests to admire your cards , but it also makes for a great decorative piece . If you are not into the idea of hanging your cards on the wall , you can get a card display rack for a more inconspicuous look . Duplicate Decks Having two of every card is not really essential , but if you do not want to take any chances with your cards , then you should buy two of every deck . Instead of asking yourself whether you want to keep your cards for show or actually play with them , you can have one that you display and another for your game nights . This way you can focus on having fun without fear of ruining your deck . Being a card game enthusiast is definitely unique . You get to display your collection and have fun arranging unforgettable game nights . Cards offer you a chance to connect with your friends and family while playing . If you take this hobby seriously though , you should invest in some card sleeves , and card boxes to protect your cards from any damage . In no time , you will be the ace of spades of the playing cards collecting game . If you are interested in even more entertainment-related articles and information from us here at Bit Rebels , then we have a lot to choose from .

My advice to all who feel lost - start a journal - write everyday -- analyze yourself -- ask those important questions of who am I , why do I like or do n't like this and that -- keep digging -- the answers will be found Just remember it is a journey -- it does n't happen overnight -- but it can be done . You can discover your true essence and your purpose in this life . And YES it is about LOVE and giving back -- Helping others find their way as well -- once you find yours . Hi Jen My name is Simona . I am 51 years old . From the age of 17 to 24 I suffered from a chemical depression that included bipolar and disassociated personality . After the birth of my first son my chemical depression dissipated a great deal and from 24 to about 31 I led for the most part a peaceful life -- raising my two sons as a stay home mom -- and also attempting to run a Creative Photography business out of the House . I ran the business for about a year -- but when I attempted to do location photography -- gave up after a failed photo shoot for a prior client . I did not poses the self confidence to persevere . Then when my younger son started school full time I began feeling guilty for not working -- but felt lost -- did not know who or what I was about -- entered a new phase -- where I questioned everything about my disassociated self , my purpose in life -- and soon after became severely depressed once more -- but this time with an existential type of depression -- pushing me into an obsessive quest for answers . At the age of 45 I finally came to the end of my quest -- figuring my purpose -- and finally feeling whole and normal like everyone else who was n't struggling with mental illness and who appeared to be enjoying life . I am writing this brief simplistic background not to share my woes too -- but to give you a sense of how long I 've dealt with mental illness . -- I experienced terrible agony , constantly wishing to die -- but could not bring myself to commit suicide -- was scarred , felt guilty -- I hit my head against the wall -- to feel physical pain -- in order to feel alive -- I stared at the ceiling for hours -- -- I had a disassociated personality -- one shy awkward -- the other dressing in provocative apparel to gain attention from men These are just a few things The Biggest Problem -- I felt entirely Alone -- Had no one to talk to -- Because number 1 -- I did n't know what was going on with me -- and # 2 No one cared to listen or even if they did -- could ever understand what I was going through -- therefore I was still alone -- BUT IN MY CASE MOSTLY BECAUSE -- MY BOYFRIEND & PARENTS -LRB- EASTERN EUROPEAN -RRB- -- JUST DID N'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH ME -- SO THEY PRETTY MUCH IGNORED MY PAIN Your Boyfriend is Lucky to have you : Now having said that -- I 'm also sure he 's feeling guilty having to put you through this pain with him -- especially when he is under the spell of the depression Depression robs you of the person you are -- One day you feel like you know who you are , you feel good about yourself , you know you posses good qualities -- and you feel worthy of the love you 're receiving AND THEN -- when the depression hits -- you do n't understand what your boyfriend or girlfriend can possibly see in you . You feel worthless . Within your mind -LRB- as a depressed person -RRB- the misery you 're feeling within that moment -- feels like it 'll always be there , like there will never be good times again -- you ca n't fall on your memories of the good times you 've had to help you through -- because when you 're able to participate & somewhat enjoy an event -- the thing is -- within you always feel & know the depression will always come back and therefore -- you are robbed of your good times as well -- which just adds fuel to the next episodes . So how to help your boyfriend : 1 . Listen -- which you already do -- 2 . Although you genuinely care about him and want to understand his pain -- there 's NO WAY -- for you to understand his pain unless you 've gone through it -- and I 'm only saying this -- to help you understand that it 's not understandable -- So -- not sure if you wrote this above but -- when you talk to him -- Do n't attempt to make it all better -- to say anything that you think will help cheer him up -- The best thing is to Just Be there with him in Silence -- if he lets you -- Just accept it and let him know that you accept the situation as it is and let him know you love him unconditionally -- maybe that you understand that this is not him but his depression 3 . Encourage him to begin a journal -- I journaled for 30 + years because I had no one to talk to -- and it was through Journaling that I was led to many transformations , AHA moments , growth , spirituality and ultimately wholeness . I self - healed through journaling . -LRB- There are many websites on the power of journaling -RRB- It was through the writing that I figured out where my disassociated personality stemmed from -- -LRB- childhood - my mother left my sister & I behind for 4 years -- I had what 's known as emotional abandonment disorder -- which played havoc in so many aspects of my life -- leading me to making poor decisions -RRB- It was through the writing that I brought my disassociated personalities together and many more changes . So instead of keeping it bottled in -- and feeling misunderstood -- he can let it all out on the page -- everything and anything . Everyday -- whether he feels good or not -- record both . Do n't misunderstand -- it 's not an overnight cure . It 's a long process . Through continuous writing he will begin to self analyze and see patterns to his moods and he will begin to trust that inner voice within him that will begin to guide him -- SO BASICALLY HE WILL NEED TO START BEING HIS OWN BEST FRIEND and eventually will begin getting AHA moments too which once he does will give him strength to make small changes . 3 . In conjunction to constant writing -- I used exercise instead of medication to keep me going -- -LRB- you said he does this already -- so that 's good -RRB- I 'm not telling him not to take medication -- I just never found the right one - and got tired of not receiving the right medical treatment . You can bond with him further by -- joining him in the exercise routines -- you need to maintain your health too and exercise releases happy chemicals -- I ran a lot -- and lifted weights -- I still do -- or else feel unbalanced 4 . Also I read a lot of spiritual books -- began listening to spiritual tapes whenever I went out on errands -- read books by Wayne Dweyer and many others -- filled notebooks full of tips 5 . See if he can figure out what excites him -- what gives him pleasure the most -- because even though he may not believe in himself or believe it may be worth perusing -- it may be what 's calling him to do Even though while I was young I did not know who or what I wanted to do when I grew up -LRB- even though I had a B.S degree in Hospitality Management - then later in my 40 's another degree / and masters in Elementary Education -RRB- as I took notes , read different type of books -- non fiction and such -- I began to notice that I enjoyed studying anything literary -- also enjoyed writing itself -- enjoyed learning new words -- actually had a weird love for words -- and could n't understand why that was -- but I began to analyze these likes of mine and went through a long doubting period regarding my passion for writing and my abilities as a writer -- and in the end concluded that this was what I was meant to do -- what my purpose in this life time was . And when I finally accepted it -- it felt like a weight got discarded from the pit of my stomach -- a weight that constantly made me feel like life was meaningless -- my existence felt meaningless . But once I discovered and accepted my purpose -- all other activities I never enjoyed before suddenly looked brighter and worth joining . All the never-ending , overburdening responsibilities of life became manageable and even enjoyable because I began to enjoy the challenge . So discovering One 's Purpose is a BIG BIG answer to solve . Some are born knowing -LRB- lucky them -RRB- others -- like I did have to struggle to find it -- and sadly many go to their graves feeling unfulfilled , having never found theirs . My purpose is to get out my 4 Volume Memoir -- which chronicles my journey -- in order to help people like your boyfriend . Volume I. Out of My Head -- A Girl 's Journey through Bipolar Depression & Disassociated Personality -LRB- In editing Process currently -RRB- 6 . Not sure how old your boyfriend is -- but unfortunately the age from 15 -- 24 -- is very difficult to go through all on it 's own but add in childhood trauma and it 's just too much So even though he may not believe it -- maybe present him with real life stories of people who have gone through similar things and who have come out of it successfully -- I PROMISE THERE IS A WAY OUT OF THE DARK TUNNEL -- It 'll always be an UP and DOWN Battle -- But if he 's aware of that -- and aware that if he does the work -- he can and will heal -- then when he enters another episode -- he may be able to view it less from a victim 's perspective and more from a conqueror type attitude . Again it 's a process . While I 'm sure he 's learned his lesson about psychedelics -- -LRB- which I understand why he did it - as I too , even though I was scarred to try pot - knowing it messes with my head -- tried it on several occasions to gain insight into why I was the way I was -- which at times helped -- but it only helped me because as I was going through the high and visions -- I wrote them down as I was experiencing them and then later was able to go back and learn things about myself which helped my progression towards healing -RRB- he may want to slow down until he becomes more stable . 7 . EDUCATE YOURSELF AND ENCOURAGE HIM TO LEARN ABOUT DIFFERENT DISFUNCTIONS -- SEE IF HE CAN PINPOINT HIS SYMPTOMS . WITH KNOWLEDGE THERE '' S POWER I 'm not a therapist and do n't pretend to know how to fully heal him -- I can only share with you what I went through BUT Since you mentioned childhood Trauma -- that is something he needs to visit -- whether through a therapist or by himself -- because once he identifies what it is that 's happened to him -- he can be with it for a while -- examine it , and understand it -- and finally through this process -- naturally discard it -- it organically stops eating at him . With me -- through the questioning , digging and what not I figured out that the reason I dressed up in a provocative way to get attention was because I felt invisible , trapped within my head -- and that was one way of feeling like I was real and existing . As a young child I was a loner . I remember images of myself as a young child often playing alone , watching other kids having fun and wishing I could be with them . And when my mother left -- no one bothered explaining to me that one day I 'll see her once more -- so in my young mind I must have felt like she abandoned me . Images of me crying nightly remained in my head for a long time . She escaped to America during the Communist Era -- brought us 4 years later -- and my father was imprisoned for a foiled escape plan . Also my grandmother brought me to my dad 's trial -- and images of my father with chains around his feet and hands have been seared into my young mind as well So all these factors contributed to my psychological break down which started surfacing from 17 on . And if you research many of these psychological dysfunctions -- you will find that that 's when they surface -- from around 17 to 25 . I never ever though I 'd ever get better -- but I did -- I figured it out - and so can your boyfriend . You are right to take time for yourself to keep yourself balanced -- because if you do n't you wo n't have anything to give him or yourself . So number 1 keep yourself healthy first -- you do n't want to end up resenting him and that 's the last thing he wants . Take Care Remember and Remind him to be patient with yourself and himself -- It SUCKS to be mentally ill -- but it 's not his fault and therefore it 's ok that he has n't figured it all out and it 's ok that he ca n't be what he probably thinks that everybody wants him to be - `` normal and healthy like everybody else -- those that seem to have no problems in facing a new day -- IT '' S OK - NO GUILT SHOULD BE ABSORBED -- but of course I 'm sure he does -- but just gently let him know that it 's OK . I hope this helped somewhat . If you need to talk further . I 'm here .

That 's 28,512,000 seconds , 475,200 minutes , 7,920 hours , or 47 weeks and a day . I 've actually found a website that calculates all this worthless data . Just enter a starting date and an ending date . It 's called the Days Calculator . Using this handy calculator , it 's 21,600 minutes until Valentine 's Day , 16 weeks and three days until my birthday , and four minutes and 20 seconds until the newspaper editor refuses to print this shallow column . `` Count ups '' were also active in the American culture long before we worried about the number of shopping days left before a major holiday . Just the other night , my wife and I were watching a 1962 episode of Gunsmoke called Cody 's Code . In it , the character named Cody gives a fellow named Brack to the count of five to draw his weapon or Cody would shoot him . Brack did n't . So Cody did . From the count of one to the count of five , we , as anxious viewers , were suspended on the tenterhooks of impending tragedy wondering what would happen next . If the drama was n't tragic , it was , in a way , comedic since the actor -LRB- Anthony Caruso -RRB- who played Cody in the one episode , also played Golden Eagle , an Arapaho chief , in the very next episode of Gunsmoke . Staying with the western genre of TV entertainment , how many times has a sheriff in an old western town threatened , `` I 'll give you until sundown to get out of town ! If you do n't , you 're a dead man ! '' Until the sun downed , the sheriff counted the minutes until Greasy Pete made his decision to leave town or planet earth . We all remember the 1952 movie High Noon in which Marshal Will Kane -LRB- Gary Cooper -RRB- and everyone in the audience sweated through their underwear wondering what would happen at twelve noon when the marshal faced a gang of killers in the street . Once we found out how Gary handled the situation , the movie ended , so the whole production was a countdown . Many countdowns involve waiting for the day the school year ends . There is a `` Counting The Days Compact Pocket Chart '' available to students for doing just that . For only $ 28.95 , the chart comes with a 15\u00a03/4 - by-18 3/4-inch pocket chart with grommets , magnetic strip and storage pocket , numeral cards , craft sticks , rubber bands and a Really Good Stuff Activity Guide . Or , students could do what we did as we counted down our final days in Vietnam . We just crossed off the days as we went . We did n't need grommets , magnetic strips , craft sticks or rubber bands , either . Then as Americans , we 've had all the countdowns to launch missile tests , satellites , the Space Shuttle and , daily , the beginning of the lunch hour . One countdown from high school recently came to mind . I counted down the days until my first date with Gritty Murkowski in the 11th grade . As soon as I dropped her off at her home that night , counting days was n't as much fun as it had been . There 's even a 2019 movie titled Countdown . A nurse downloads an app that , supposedly , can predict when a person will die . Unfortunately , the nurse discovers that SHE has only three days to live . I guess the rest of the movie is a screamer as the nurse tries to save her own life . I 'm not really making fun of counting down the days . How could I when there are only 259,200 seconds , 4,320 minutes , 72 hours , and 3 days remaining until the Super Bowl game kicks off ?

On Jan. 5 , Ofc . Imarie Waller , age 25 , was accused by another corrections officer -- who claimed to see `` sexually inappropriate '' Snapchat messages with photos between her and the 18-year-old parolee . The officer who made the accusations said Waller and the parolee were in a relationship , according to court documents . The accusations led to a search of Waller 's phone , where investigators found several nude pictures of the alleged victim .

During a search of the parolee 's room and phone , police found naked pictures of Waller . Court documents say Waller later admitted to having consensual unprotected sex with the parolee but denied that it happened in his group home . She would n't say when the alleged relationship began , and in the middle of the interview with investigators , Waller went to the bathroom , where she used her Apple Watch to tell her roommate to deliver a message to the parolee saying to `` deny '' and `` delete everything .

The Paper Moon star , 56 , got candid about her battle with rheumatoid arthritis on Instagram on Wednesday , sharing a photo of her bruised and scarred back to show the effects of living with the autoimmune disease . `` Living with rheumatoid arthritis . A fall scratch scar on my right hip . And the back surgery scar from eight years ago , '' she wrote in the caption , pointing out each scar seen on her body . `` My last back surgery scar is on the front from February . '' `` And all those red marks are from heating pads ~ I probably should turn those down a little bit , '' she continued . Though her bruises may look severe , O'Neal assured her followers that `` believe it or not this is me actually getting better . '' `` Cheers to everyone and rheumatoid arthritis can go f -- itself , '' she added along with the hashtag `` rheumatoid arthritis warrior . '' A rep for the star did not immediately respond to PEOPLE 's request for comment . O'Neal previously touched on her battle with rheumatoid arthritis on Sunday . Posting a black-and-white photo of herself sitting beside her dog on Instagram , the Oscar winner told fans she was `` on the mend . '' `` Hi , I 've been in some rheumatoid arthritis bull crap but finally I 'm feeling a little bit better , '' she shared with her followers . `` I hate texting because my hands suck Right now . . so If I do n't text you back I promise it 's nothing personal . '' Rheumatoid arthritis , also known as RA , is a chronic inflammatory disorder that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body 's issues , according to the Mayo Clinic . The condition can cause inflammation , swelling and pain throughout the body that may lead to bone erosion and joint deformity . Rheumatoid arthritis can also affect the skin , eyes , lungs , heart and kidneys , as well as blood vessels and nervous tissues . In an Instagram post shared in December , O'Neal wrote that she had been seeking medical treatment for the condition . `` Second dose of #actemra hoping to get RA back to the way it 's been Not like how it is which is lame !! '' she wrote , posting a picture of her prescription medication 's packaging . Last March , O'Neal revealed to fans that she had underwent a spinal surgery known as anterior lumbar interbody fusion -LRB- ALIF -RRB- . The surgery is a type of spinal fusion that mends the front and lumbar spine bones together by removing and replacing the intervertebral disc with a bone or metal spacer , according to the USC Spine Center . `` ALIF is commonly performed for a variety of painful spinal conditions , such as spondylolisthesis and degenerative disc disease , among others , '' according to USC 's website . At the time , O'Neal updated fans of her progress through a series on posts on her Instagram . In one video , the actress used a walker down the hallway of her hospital as she recited lines from Sunset Boulevard with her son Sean . `` Yes , darling , I 'm here .

Jason 's worried that Danielle might `` smell too good '' and he 'll lose his train of thought , and honestly , it 's a little alarming to be so easily distracted WHEN YOU FLY COMMERCIAL PLANES FOR A LIVING . The routine is n't the most technically sound , but Jason can not take his eyes off of her and he 's smiling the entire time . Maybe she does smell good ? Danielle & Cody , `` Fall on Me '' by Christina Aguilera and A Great Big World Well , this one is emotional from the get-go , because Jenna brings up Danielle 's late mother and we 're all crying now , are you happy ? If the faster routine seemed challenging , this one is not only much more romantic , but it is also littered with lifts . Danielle 's nervous about letting go that much and trusting a complete stranger . I mean , that 's the premise of this show , but okay . Cody , meanwhile , finds that the routine has `` a lot of sexy '' in it for him , a gentlemanly midwestern boy . He might vomit ? Once the routine starts , the eye contact is intense . They seem extremely into each other . Also , this guy is so tall he makes those scary lifts look easy . Okay , maybe not easy , but easy-ish . Easier than they seemed in rehearsal . After the dance , Cody adorably admits that Danielle is a woman he 'd be intimidated to approach in a bar , so , maybe this blind dance date is the way to go ? Am I being persuaded ? What is life ? Danielle walks away after the dance and immediately starts crying over the romance and this is a done deal , folks . I 'm rooting for them ! The Second Date : Was there any contest here ? She was crying , sir ! Danielle , of course , goes with Cody -- do n't worry , Pilot Jordan has #NoRegrets -- and the two have a goofy , awkward-ish second date in which Cody reveals he 's super into astrological signs . Who knew ? Danielle seems to be into it and in their update , Cody and Danielle have embarked on a third date to see where things go . I need more updated updates , Flirty Dancing . Jordan Jordan here is a very tall tree man and a former baseball player-turned-real estate investor . He 's a single dad with a very cute daughter , in case you were n't already interested . Jordan 's been single for five years , is over superficial online dating , and insists he 's too shy to approach women IRL . Well , this show is going to be a shock to him , huh ? Also , it should be noted that in some of Jordan 's b-roll of him walking outside the rehearsal studio , there 's just a stray black cat walking alongside him . That 's very ominous and we do n't need those kinds of vibes here on this show , okay ? There 's so much riding against us as it is . Jordan & Mary , `` Bones '' by Galantis featuring OneRepublic For his fast dance , Jordan is paired with ER nurse Mary . She wants a love like her parents , who are living the dream in a 36-year marriage . Jenna thinks Mary 's nurturing side will be a good fit for Jordan . Sharna Burgess is back to choreograph , and she gives Jordan and Mary an athletic number to perform on the staircase in the famous Los Angeles Theatre . As if rehearsing for this routine is n't stressful enough , at one point while Mary is learning choreography , Jenna and Sharna just start chanting `` flirt ! flirt ! flirt ! '' from the back of the room , and I swear I 've had a nightmare like that before . As soon as Jordan sees Mary at the top of steps , he smiles . He 's ready to dance with this woman . The dance is energetic and fun , but there does n't seem to be much chemistry between the two . After the dance , Jordan says that he could n't wait for her to come down the steps and Mary says she felt something when Jordan grabbed her hand for the first time , but maybe that thing was just sweat ? I 'm not buying it . Jordan & Kristen , `` Shallow '' by Us the Duo I mean , does poor Mary even have shot ? You 're giving these two `` Shallow ! '' How can people not fall for each other while dancing to this song ? Kristen , a 31-year-old wardrobe stylist who went through a tough divorce two years prior , starts crying the minute she hears it . Everyone is primed for love ! From the very start of the routine , this one feels different from Jordan and Mary . May all the angels bless Sharna Burgess for this steamy choreography . There 's lots of choreographed face touching and big lifts and generally a lot of time for Jordan and Kristen to be close together . And then it happens guys : At the end of the routine , in the awkward heavy breathing portion of the evening before they are supposed to walk away from each other as if none of this ever happened , JORDAN KISSES KRISTEN . He tells Jenna he was just in the moment and `` it felt right '' and Kristen seems very happy it happened , so we 're all fine with it . The Second Date : If Jordan does n't choose the woman he kissed , what are we even doing here ? Of course , he wants to meet Kristen . Kudos to Mary who is basically like , `` Yeah , I 'll be totally fine . '' It seems like Jordan and Kristen have some real chemistry when they meet for the second time , sans choreography , and in their update video they 're still making out , so that seems cool . `` Shallow , '' man . `` Shallow '' will do it .", "url": "https://ew.com/recap/flirty-dancing-season-1-episode-4/", "kws": ["Dance^^Day", "love", "JORDAN^^KISSES^^KRISTEN", "sans^^choreography", "dating", "rehearsal", "vibes", "drama", "finding^^love", "women^^IRL", "sweat", "Christina^^Aguilera", "thought", "Jenna^^Dewan", "feelings", "things", "Sharna^^Burgess", "sort", "Danielle^^Danielle", "ER^^nurse^^Mary"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 0.9999099969863892}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Other": 0.9999099969863892}}}

It also can spring from pure possibility , given an opportunity that presents itself when one has the foresight to take full advantage . That 's the scenario that presented itself to Jagger Lane , a band that consists of drummer/vocalist Chad Silence , bassist/vocalist Mike Lewis , singer Bill Hampton , and guitarists Robbie Griffen and David Russell . Hampton and Lewis originally convened under another aegis in 2011 and subsequently recruited Russell in 2017 . The momentum stalled for awhile , but when they had the occasion to reactivate and reinvent the band , veteran East Tennessee musicians Griffin and Silence were added to the ensemble . `` It 's the most exciting group of guys I 've been around , '' Hampton said . `` They make my job of belting out tunes very easy . '' The formal beginnings of Jagger Lane can be traced to an annual private gathering in Jamestown , Tennessee , that Russell previously had played with the earlier incarnation of the group . `` We came together out of necessity in a sense , '' Russell said . `` The groups I had played with had dried out in a sense , but this gig was coming up and we wanted to still do the show . We had like four weeks to put it together and I scrambled to find fellas to play with . Bill had been speaking with Robbie , who reached out to Chad to sit in on drums , which then followed Mike stepping in on bass guitar . We met up two times for rehearsal , played the gig , it went great , and we just kind of went from there . We did n't even have the name figured out at that show . '' Fortunately , the handle followed in short order . The `` Jagger '' portion of the moniker -- an obvious allusion to the Rolling Stones -- was Hampton 's suggestion , while Russell suggested `` Lane '' be added to the name because he figured the road reference would grab attention . Once the aforementioned gig was done and the name was locked in place -- `` I would later find out that Bill 's daughter was expecting a young rocker whose first and middle name were one and the same , which adds to the cool factor , '' Russell said -- the group opted to continue . `` We kind of had the feeling this was something good , '' Russell continued . `` Experience had made us a little cautious that maybe this would fall flat . You learn to push forward , rockin ' your six strings , but knowing any moment you may be looking for new folks to play with or a new place to play . '' Four months on , Russell said that many of those initial uncertainties have dissipated . So far , the band has performed twice at Two Doors Down in Maryville , and at clubs in Athens and Chattanooga . Although their upcoming show at Brackins Blues Club marks their debut appearance with this particular musical configuration , the various members have played there in different capacities . Meanwhile , their choice of cover songs has evolved as well . Russell cites an array of influences spawned from rock 's heyday in the '60s and '70s -- `` the kind of music you expect to rock out as you travel across the country just watching the miles go by ... that when the radio breaks in , you 're left thinking , ` Damn , that was an awesome 30-40 minutes of rock music ! ''' He personally counts Jimmy Page , Jimi Hendrix , Stevie Ray Vaughan and the British group the Darkness as among his personal favorites . Nevertheless , Russell said the band had to consider other factors as well . `` Originally , it was about finding enough tunes that we all knew well enough to cover for that private party we were playing , '' he said . `` As soon as the next gigs started coming in , our mindset started changing . It was , ` OK , we want to put out tunes that make you tap your toe , want to get on the dance floor and keep you entertained . ' Anything that 's a rock song is n't beyond the range of the possibilities . We may pay homage to a blues or country song , but our direction is straight , upbeat rock ` n ' roll . We aim to entertain . '' That 's evidenced by the band 's list of covers , which range from `` Honky Tonk Women '' by the Rolling Stones to Billy Idol 's `` Rebel Yell , '' with an ample influx of Tom Petty , Aerosmith , the Black Crowes and , according to Russell , `` a rockin ' version of ` Devil Went Down to Georgia ' that Robbie Griffin melts the strings off his guitar , solo-wise ! '' He said that the group 's immediate goal is to book as many appearances as it can while pleasing audiences in the process . `` There 's some seriously great attitudes in this group when it comes to rockin ' out , putting on a good show , and doing a good job in general . '' Russell said . `` I love playing guitar with them because they make it easy . I just have to stand there , look cool , rip solos , then settle back into the rhythm with some crunchy guitar riffs , and occasionally sing a song here and there .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrDmOMO", "title": "AEW Dynamite Results : Winners , Grades , Reaction and Highlights from January 15", "content": "For the first time since the demise of WCW in 2001 , Bash at the Beach returned to the wrestling calendar with the January 15 episode of All Elite Wrestling 's Dynamite . The event , headlined by a massive four-way bout to determine the top contenders to the AEW Tag Team Championships , continued the young promotion 's build to their next pay-per-view , Revolution . Also on tap for the broadcast was a showdown between Jon Moxley and The Inner Circle 's Sammy Guevara , just one week after the latter outsmarted world champion Chris Jericho . What consequences would Moxley face at the hands of Le Champion and his faction ? Find out with this recap of the explosive episode , live from Miami . Fatal 4-Way Number One Contenders ' Match 1 of 6 This week 's broadcast kicked off with four of the best teams -LRB- Santana and Ortiz , Best Friends , The Young Bucks and the team of Kenny Omega and Hangman Page -RRB- in AEW battling for the right to challenge SCU for the tag team titles . The Bucks and Omega worked together at one point , frustrating Page , who watched his own partner celebrate with the opposition . The Elite 's early dominance ended with a big tornado DDT by Trent to Nick Jackson . The Best Friends made some excellently timed tags to sustain their advantage . Matt Jackson fought his way back into the match but Santana and Ortiz beat him down and isolated him from any potential hot tag . A big spear created separation and Jackson tagged Omega . The Cleaner exploded into the match . Page joined him for some double-team offense , including a moonsault from Hangman , off the top rope and onto the opposition at ringside . The other teams followed suit , the high spots becoming riskier and riskier until Trent delivered a superplex from the top rope on Matt , wiping out every other competitor on the floor in the process . Moments later , Orange Cassidy entered the fray to a thunderous ovation and though he found himself knocked to the arena floor , Best Friends capitalized , delivering Strong Zero on Omega . Eventually , Omega recovered and delivered a V-Trigger . Page made the cover and picked up the win , stealing the glory from his partner . After the match , Hangman somewhat reluctantly showed respect to the Bucks as the Elite posed heading into the break . Result Page and Omega defeated Santana and Ortiz , Best Friends and The Young Bucks Grade B + Analysis This was a red-hot opener with some superb action that not only got the show off to an action-packed start , it also wrote the latest chapter in the ongoing saga of Page and Omega . At times , it was very apparent that they were not on the same page , and Hangman swooping in to steal the pin away from Omega was a nice touch for a star desperately seeking momentum . Theirs is a story that feels destined to climax soon , perhaps as soon as their upcoming tag title bout with SCU . And rightfully so . With Revolution coming up , Page vs. Omega is a strong addition to the card . That is , as long as management does not hold off the tag title match until then in hopes of building to an even more significant showdown , perhaps at Double or Nothing 2 in May . The only questionable element of the entire match ? The loss suffered by Santana and Ortiz , who really should be more protected as members of The Inner Circle . Cody Responds to MJF 's Stipulations 2 of 6 Cody hit the ring to discuss the stipulations put forth by MJF two weeks ago and whether or not he would accept them in order to get his hands on his former friend . The American Nightmare ran down the list , approaching each one-by-one and the thought process behind them . He suggested MJF was stalling , called the `` old-school heel '' lazy and accepted every single one of the stipulations . He vowed to give his rival his own scar come February 29 to wrap up the promo . Grade A Analysis Cody is the best talker in the business right now , thanks to his ability to strike an emotional chord with audiences . Every response is raw and guttural . More importantly , he did something MJF failed to two weeks earlier : he gave a look into the thought process behind each one . He told a story with every explanation and had fans hanging on every word . The result ? A greater demand to see the match and more excitement surrounding it . The question now is whether or not the final product can possibly live up to the promo work Cody has put into it to this point . If the EVP 's history is any indication , the answer is a resounding ` yes . ' Kris Statlander and Hikaru Shida vs. Mel and Awesome Kong 3 of 6 Brandi Rhodes filled in for Awesome Kong , teaming with Mel as The Nightmare Collective battled Kris Statlander and Hikaru Shida . The heels jumped Statlander as Shida made her entrance , leaving the Japanese-born competitor to make the save . Shida started with Mel and withstood her larger opponent 's early onslaught to drop her at ringside . A springboard knee to the face , off a chair , continued the babyfaces ' advantage . The heels recovered , though , and worked over Shida during the commercial break . They cut the ring off from her partner , but Shida recovered and tagged Statlander in . AEW 's resident alien took the fight to Rhodes and scored a near-fall . A messy top-rope dropkick from Shida barely clipped Mel , who shook it off and sent Shida into the guardrail . Back inside , Mel battled Statlander , only for Shida to re-enter the match and deliver a big superplex . A running knee strike by Statlander gave way to a standing moonsault . The action broke down , devoid of any tags or general continuity . Statlander eventually put Mel away with a package tombstone piledriver for the win . Result Statlander and Shida defeated Rhodes and Mel Grade C Analysis At some point , AEW really has to address the blatant disregard of the rules in its tag team matches . At one point here , Shida re-entered the ring and delivered a superplex without any reprimanding from the official . She was allowed in , to execute moves and even drag Brandi into the match despite the fact that Statlander was the legal competitor . No referee admonishing or anything of the sort . That is an issue that has plagued tag matches throughout the short history of AEW and one area of the show that desperately needs addressed . Furthermore , how is the audience to believe in The Nightmare Collection as a legitimate threat when they lose their first match ? Are they only a real threat to the rest of the roster when Awesome Kong is around and if so , why is the group even a thing ? Again , the women 's division action presented more issues that demand attention than solutions . Jon Moxley vs. Sammy Guevara 4 of 6 A week after Jon Moxley stuck it to The Inner Circle and more importantly AEW champion Chris Jericho , he squared off with `` Spanish God '' Sammy Guevara in singles competition . Guevara took the fight to Moxley early but the antihero of AEW shrugged it off and answered with chops of his own . A big cutter halted the top contender 's momentum and allowed Guevara a momentary upper-hand . Moxley fought back with a slap and delivered a release suplex for two . He dragged the young star to the ring apron and teased a Paradigm Shift but Guevara fought out and delivered a big pump kick . The Spanish God drove Moxley back-first into the apron , the into the steel steps before arrogantly posing back in the ring . Back from the break , a re-energized Moxley attempted a comeback but Guevara delivered a standing Shooting Star Press for a two-count . An inverted DDT by Moxley earned him a two of his own . Guevara fought out of a Paradigm Shift from the top rope and delivered a Spanish Fly . Moxley recovered and applied a rear naked choke for an immediate tapout victory . After the match , Jericho 's music played before the arena went dark . When the lights came back up , Moxley found himself confronted by The Inner Circle , who beat him down in a five-on-one assault . Jericho grabbed a spike from his jacket and proceeded to jam it into the eye of Moxley , much to the disgust of the commentary team . The ringside doctor checked on Moxley as Jericho and Co. celebrated heading into the break . Result Moxley defeated Guevara Grade A Analysis Lost in the chaos of this all was that Moxley 's victory sets him up for a match with either Darby Allin or Pac on next week 's show , a shot at Jericho 's title awaiting that match . The match itself was fine for what it was and really put Guevara over as a strong in-ring competitor who can knock off the top stars in the company . Moxley winning was no real surprise , nor was the beatdown from The Inner Circle . The strength of the segment , though , was the old-school angle that accompanied the attack . The spike to the eye is heel savagery at its best and creates doubt that Moxley can possibly come back from the assault challenge Jericho as so many expected . For the sake of the night 's broadcast , it adds greater urgency to Allin vs. Pac , which suddenly feels like a No. 1 contender 's match with Moxley 's status uncertain . Diamond Dallas Page , QT Marshall , and Dustin Rhodes vs. Butcher , Blade , and MJF 5 of 6 A week ago , The Butcher , The Blade and The Bunny joined MJF for a beatdown on Diamond Dallas Page that ended only when Dustin Rhodes and QT Marshall made the save . This week , Page returned to the squared circle , teaming with Marshall and Rhodes to battle Butcher , Blade and MJF in a high-profile Six-Man Tag Team match . Page and MJF started for their respective teams , or so it seemed . The heel tagged Butcher into the match , wanting nothing to do with the master of the Diamond Cutter . When Page tagged Marshall into the match , MJF re-entered the ring and paired off with the journeyman competitor . During the break , the heels earned control of the match , working over Rhodes . MJF never missed an opportunity to gloat , posing in between dishing out punishment to the heels . The grizzled vet Rhodes downed Blade and made the tag to DDP , who exploded into the match and took the fight to the opposition . Page tried for a Diamond Cutter but MJF countered and delivered a low blow . Rhodes tagged back in , delivered a destroyer to the cocky young competitor and Page dropped him with a Diamond Cutter . Butcher made the save and Rhodes wiped him out with a senton . Marshall took out Blade and Page dove off the top rope , wiping everyone out at ringside . Back inside the squared circle , MJF scored a quick rollup on Marshall for the win . Result MJF , Butcher and Blade defeated Rhodes , Marshall and DDP Grade B Analysis This was a really fun , energetic match that popped the crowd and kept the fans invested throughout . With that said , there is a very real question as to whether MJF should be struggling to beat a past-his-prime Hall of Famer and a guy in Marshall who is hardly what you would call a guy portrayed as an elite talent in AEW . Ditto Butcher and Blade , whose credibility takes an Ascension-like hit with every passing week . Instead of establishing themselves as a threat in the tag team division , they are glorified enhancement talent that bumps around too much to be considered a dominant force of any kind . Despite a gimmick that would suggest otherwise . Still , the overall quality of the match made up for the obvious faults , but AEW officials really should better evaluate their use of MJF ahead of what should be a career-making match with Cody at Revolution . Darby Allin vs. Pac 6 of 6 With the uncertainty surrounding Jon Moxley 's eye injury , the main event of Wednesday 's show took on greater significance as Darby Allin and Pac squared off , a potential shot at Chris Jericho 's AEW world title at stake . Pac seized control ahead of the break , sending Allin into the steel ring steps . He dominated the action coming out of the commercial , dropping Allin with a shotgun dropkick from the top . The face-painted enigma fought back and delivered a Coffin Drop to the arena floor . A stunner and sunset flip bomb by Allin continued his comeback attempt , netting him a count of two . The action continued back and forth , Allin trying for a springboard Coffin Drop , only for The Bastard to catch him mid-flight with a German suplex . A sit-out powerbomb earned Pac another near-fall . As the action moved up top , Pac dropped Allin with a headbutt . He followed with the Black Arrow to the back for the pin-fall victory . After the match , Pac labeled himself the No. 1 contender and threatened Jericho 's reign as champion . Moxley emerged from the back of an ambulance , his eye taped up , and entered the arena . He vowed to kick Pac 's ass and earn the title shot next week . Result Pac defeated Allin Grade A Analysis MJF and Hangman Page may have more immediate success , and may capture a world title first , but Allin is the competitor who will inspire the loudest reaction when he finally scores his long-awaited win over a top AEW star . Allin has been nothing short of phenomenal , consistently rising to the occasion and performing up to the level of the competition . He was stellar here , delivering a performance befitting one of the building blocks of AEW 's bright future . Pac and Moxley have unfinished business after their time-limit draw from November and a match between them is a star-studded way to cap off next Wednesday 's episode as part of Chris Jericho 's Rock and Rager : Part Deux cruise .", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2871515-aew-dynamite-results-winners-grades-reaction-and-highlights-from-january-15", "kws": ["AEW^^Dynamite", "AEW^^officials", "Highlights", "singles^^competition", "tag^^matches", "Contenders", "November", "This^^week", "Diamond^^Dallas^^Page", "world^^champion", "ringside", "Le^^Champion", "WCW", "Bash", "Diamond^^Cutter", "Elite", "Moments", "Dustin^^Rhodes", "Part^^Deux^^cruise", "Kenny^^Omega"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 0.9998924732208252}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Other": 0.9998924732208252}}}

If I did n't have an obligation to write a bunch of words after each game , I 'd type `` I want those 2.5 hours of my life back , '' hit publish , close my laptop and then go watch 1,000-lb Sisters on TLC . But that game needs a documented recap in KentuckySportsRadio.com 's records , so let 's find a way to summarize that hideous display of basketball -LRB- and officiating -RRB- that we all just watched on the SEC Network . If you were there in person , you should inquire about a ticket refund . Here we go . This is going to suck . We 're not even going to number anything . Who cares . Kentucky lost to a horrible South Carolina team . In case you just wandered in here off the streets , let 's begin this adventure by pointing out the overarching theme to the evening : tenth-ranked Kentucky lost a basketball game at nothing-ranked South Carolina , 81-78 . That is the same South Carolina that had n't won at home since Dec. 1 ; the same South Carolina that lost to Houston by 20 at home , then Stetson by 9 at home , and then Florida by 13 at home . Stetson . We 're going to break company policy and talk officiating right out of the gate . My goodness , how bad was the officiating tonight ? There are only 40 minutes in a college basketball game and the crew somehow found a way to call 54 fouls . Take a breath , guys . Maybe let the 10 college students around you have a chance to , you know , play basketball . It 's why they were there , on the basketball court , wearing basketball uniforms . The rest of us tuned in for them , not you . That 's not to put the loss on the officiating crew because Kentucky still should 've won the horribly-called game . This is n't a sore loser thing . The refs just gave us an unwatchable product , which is becoming an all-too common problem in the sport , and robbed both teams of any flow to the game . It was bad both ways : missed calls , ticky-tack calls , wrong calls , the hell are you doing calls and even an eye-roll for Ashton Hagans for having the audacity to make his case after a whistle . I 've never in my life seen a ref do this . Wow ???? pic.twitter.com/RIdrC5oEZu -- Big Blue Drew -LRB- @BigBlueDrew33 -RRB- January 16 , 2020 Then again , that 's exactly what South Carolina wanted . Frank Martin 's team loves to muck it up and throw its opponent out of rhythm . Mission accomplished . But the defense started off so well ! Kentucky did n't allow anything to start the game , holding the Gamecocks without a made basket until almost seven minutes into the game . South Carolina did get two free throws to end the shutout after over five minutes of nothing in the scoring column , but only because it was already in the bonus . Yes , South Carolina was in the bonus before making a field goal . Unfortunately , Kentucky was n't exactly lighting it up on the other end to capitalize on its D . The Cats had six turnovers in the first six minutes , in addition to all of those fouls . Turnovers and Fouls would be a great name for a book about this game by the way . The second half defense was butt . South Carolina scored 60 points only once in the four games before Kentucky came to town . In the other three games in that four-game span , the Gamecocks ' final point totals were 59 , 56 and 55 . You see , South Carolina is a very low-scoring team , one of the worst shooting teams in the continental United States . South Carolina scored 56 in the second half against Kentucky . The really good teams hit the gas and speed off ahead when up 14 in the second half . Kentucky did the opposite . Rather than putting the pedal to the metal , Kentucky took a quick glance in its rearview , slammed on the brakes , turn its head over its right shoulder with its right arm around the passenger seat , and drove the complete opposite direction in reverse . Coach Cal said it himself after the game : Once Kentucky got up 14 early in the second half , the lead should 've been stretched to 20 + and everyone 's happy on the plane ride home . This team did the exact opposite of that and let South Carolina get back in the game , then went even further and watched South Carolina go on to win the game . Foul trouble played a big role in giving up the lead , as did the never-quit in South Carolina . You can commend the Gamecocks for fighting back -- cockfighting back , rather . But you got ta put things away for good when you can or you set yourself up to lose on a banked-in prayer at the buzzer . Also , that buzzer-beater is the most South Carolina way to win a basketball game . Was there any doubt that Cuisinart or whatever his name was would fling one in ? That dude had a career game . 26 points on 22 shots when he averaged nine points and eight shot attempts per game all season . Of course it 's THAT guy who beats you when South Carolina 's star , AJ Lawson , was a complete non-factor , which is another reason this outcome is so bizarre . Are we still going ? Let 's keep going . Shout out to Immanuel Quickley . Quickley tried to will Kentucky to victory all by himself there at the end . He had a team-high 20 points and at one point made his 13th three-pointer in his last 14 tries -LRB- not all in this game obviously -RRB- . In a game full of negatives , one of the few positives is Immanuel Quickley 's emergence into a star is still pushing forward . He 's averaging a team-best 19.0 points with 16 3-pointers over the last five games . Poor Keion Brooks was robbed of another important tip-in . A couple of times in a matter of seconds , actually . He and Whitney seem to be taking one step forward , two steps back ; although Brooks was big on the glass in the loss . He matched Richards ' team-high seven rebounds , but missed all five of his shot attempts . Whitney , man . I do n't know how much longer he can play . One loss in SEC play is n't the end of the world . It happens just about every year : Kentucky goes on the road to play a team riding a losing streak , only to run into a lively crowd that shows up once a year , often at a weird time on a weeknight , and it ends in a loss . This was that game and it just happens that way sometimes . The season goes on with a bounce-back game at Arkansas on Saturday .

But even more importantly , we also get a feel for the setting and environment of the army base that will serve as the stage for the players . The army base is a remote outpost in Afghanistan that has the screwball energy that will draw comparisons to ` MASH ' . The soldiers and the medics on the base all seem to be hustling to earn some extra cash -- from Instagram modeling for firearm manufacturers to betting on bare-knuckle boxing matches to smuggling carpets to exchanging just-expired medicines for hashish . In between all of this wheeling and dealing , you also get a botched rescue mission that puts Rosa Alvarez -LRB- Cristina Rodlo -RRB- into a funk about missing a simple exit wound that leads to the death of a soldier . It is a boiler-plate narrative that gives the audience a chance to understand the dynamics between her , Cooper Roback -LRB- Sam Keeley -RRB- and Mekhi Davis -LRB- Jeremy Tardy -RRB- who are buddies and how they have formed an informal family support structure for each other . They are the Three Musketeers on the medic team , bossed around by the no-nonsense Sonia Holloway -LRB- Beth Riesgraf -RRB- . Holloway butts heads most frequently with Cooper Roback , the `` good-bad '' guy . She is annoyed when he smuggles carpets out while rescuing soldiers and refuses to listen when he says the money from selling the rugs will go to the dead soldier 's family . She confiscates them in the Army 's name . She is also annoyed that he rescues a yet-unnamed Afghan local despite the base being stretched for medical resources and beds . Roback 's explanation that the local speaks so many languages does n't fly with her . Holloway has no time for sentimentality and she puts Roback through the grinder for his irregular , rule-breaking good deeds and confines him to the base . After this , you also see Roback teaming up with Davis to give local kids vaccination shots on the sly . These instances cement Roback in the minds of the audience as the good guy and Davis as his trusty sidekick . This is necessary since the episode starts with Roback having sex with Grace Durkin -LRB- Gage Golightly -RRB- , the golden girl of the army base , who also happens to be the girlfriend of the macho male soldier , Sasquatch -LRB- Derek Theler -RRB- . Durkin 's excuse is that Roback has magic fingers that give her the orgasms that Sasquatch ca n't . She also wisely realizes that Roback is not the `` settle down '' type , preferring the chase and the excitement of doing it in secret . She also ca n't break up with Sasquatch because he is her meal-ticket to lucrative Instagram modeling gigs for firearm manufacturers that will help her get to L.A. after her army stint where she can become a body double for Jennifer Lawrence . Through the first episode , you constantly get the feeling that the medics and soldiers are on the base as reluctant participants , already dreaming about their post-army life . They seem more focused on making a few quick bucks while getting the army credentials that they will be able to leverage in their civilian life . It is a cynical take and in some ways diminishes the sacrifices that the men in uniform make for the country . When Roback gets pummelled by Sasquatch in a boxing match that the soldiers on the base are betting on , Mekhi Davis realizes he has lost a considerable amount of money . And this leads to , you guessed it , another side hustle to recoup the money . Roback uses his soft touch with Durkin to get access to the medicine supply cabin . Roback and Davis sneak in to get their hands on the just-expired medicine -LRB- that would be destroyed by the Army -RRB- and are caught by Anthony Petrocelli -LRB- Nicholas Coombe -RRB- . Petrocelli is a newbie soldier who wants to be a good soldier and report them until Roback offers to cut him in on their deal . Their `` deal '' happens to be with a local warlord , who they will exchange the medicines with for high-grade hashish . The deal goes sideways as expected but Roback 's quick thinking gets them out of a sticky situation with 10 pounds of hashish securely stashed in their backpacks . But this is when things take a downturn for our heroes who think nothing of taking a stroll in a war zone . Petrocelli is so naive that when he gets bored of waiting for the guys in the ambulance , he takes off to babysit a goat named ` Boz ' . Having lost his way , he is suddenly surrounded by a group of soldiers led by Sasquatch who is obviously strategizing about how to blow the village sky high . Just when Petrocelli is about to spill the beans about why he is out there , Roback and Davis find him . Sasquatch tells them to clear out and they do . But when they get back to the ambulance , they find it has been torched . Big surprise there . Without wheels , they start their trek back to base with trepidations about how they 'll survive . It is a roller coaster start to a series that promises to feature more hijinks that Roback and the others cook up , starting with trying to get back to base in one piece .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrEn8DP", "title": "The eight most striking details from the Aaron Hernandez series on Netflix", "content": "A much-anticipated docuseries on Aaron Hernandez hit Netflix on Wednesday , and over three episodes it traces his shocking and seemingly incomprehensible downfall . Between the ages of 16 and 27 , the Connecticut native went from being a fun-loving high school star to a well-paid tight end for the Super Bowl-minded Patriots , only to end up committing suicide in prison after being convicted of one Boston-area murder and heavily implicated in two others . Members of Hernandez 's family declined to participate in the series , the executive producers of which are a pair of sportswriters , Dan Wetzel and Kevin Armstrong , who appear frequently in the episodes to recount events . Hernandez can be heard speaking with a number of people close to him , including his mother and his fiancee , in phone conversations recorded while he was in a Bristol County -LRB- Connecticut -RRB- jail . In addition , the series features commentary from childhood friends , law enforcement and prison officials , defense attorneys , journalists and Patriots teammates . Here are the eight most striking details that emerged from `` Killer Inside : The Mind of Aaron Hernandez . '' - - - His high school quarterback said they were in a sexual relationship As with many other aspects of the series , those who followed Hernandez 's saga closely or who happened to catch a relevant headline may already have been familiar with the claims made by Dennis SanSoucie , his quarterback and close friend at Bristol Central High . Those unfamiliar with the claims , however , may well be taken aback to hear SanSoucie say they `` experimented '' sexually . `` We continued because we probably enjoyed it . `` Yes , we were in a relationship back then , '' SanSoucie tells the camera , `` but at the time , you do n't look at it like that . '' Elsewhere in the series , SanSoucie says that when news emerged that Hernandez may have had a lover in prison , his father scoffed and declared that there was no way the stud athlete he knew could be gay . SanSoucie said it took him months after that before he `` broke the news '' about himself and Hernandez . SanSoucie 's father , Tim , sits next to his son and says at one point that he was `` homophobic '' years ago , just as Hernandez 's father was . `` Aaron was extremely terrified of his father finding out , '' Dennis SanSoucie adds . `` I mean , Mr. Hernandez was well known as a man 's man , a father that slapped the -LSB- gay slur -RSB- right out of you . '' While the series is understandably incapable of fully explaining what drove Hernandez to forfeit his lucrative athletic career in favor of the criminality that eventually led to at least one homicide , `` Killer Inside '' posits at several points that his discomfort with his sexual inclinations , or at least the way they might be viewed by others , manifested itself in angry and occasionally violent outbursts . Other potential factors , such as his brain being posthumously discovered with a stunningly advanced case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy -LRB- CTE -RRB- , as well as his father 's abrupt death when he was 16 , are also explored . Yet the possibility that Hernandez was homosexual or bisexual is consistently raised in the series , including by former Patriots offensive lineman Ryan O'Callaghan , who came out as gay after his NFL career ended in 2011 . O'Callaghan appreciated the Patriots culture , pointing out that the team 's focus on winning and mandate to avoid any and all distractions made life easier for him as someone in the closet . He also suggested that Hernandez was extremely concerned about deterring any suspicion regarding his sexuality . `` I think the whole story about Aaron is really unfortunate because you do n't know what drove him to do these things , '' the former offensive lineman declares . `` You know , if he was able to be himself and have some of these negative things not in his life , what kind of difference would that have made ? '' The series also notes that Hernandez 's older brother , DJ Hernandez , wrote in a book that there was a time when Aaron , inspired by female cousins , wanted to become a cheerleader . Their father ended that quickly , DJ claimed . - - - He grew up in such a pro-University of Connecticut family , even their dog was named UConn The Hernandez household was all about the Huskies - for as long as the patriarch , Dennis Hernandez , was alive and providing leadership and stability for young Aaron . The father , known in their Bristol neighborhood as `` The King , '' played at U-Conn . and DJ was a quarterback there who would soon be joined by his star tight end of a sibling . Everything changed , according to several interviewees in the series , after Dennis Hernandez unexpectedly died in 2006 while undergoing hernia surgery . `` Once his father passed , '' the sheriff in charge of the Bristol jail says , '' -LSB- Hernandez -RSB- basically lost the ballast that kept him on course . '' A childhood friend and football teammate , Steven Ziogas , tells us Dennis Hernandez was `` that rock , someone who can set that foundation of values to make sure you 're gon na be a good man , a good father and a good member of the community . '' With his death , Ziogas says , `` Now that 's all gone . '' Dennis Hernandez was n't always a positive role model , though , according to `` Killer Inside . '' DJ Hernandez is seen saying their father had issues with alcohol , and `` if it was n't a good day , you felt it . '' In a phone call to Tanya Singleton , a cousin with whom he was very close , Hernandez describes his father as a good man who possessed a wild side . He also says his father 's relationship was his mother was destructive , suggesting that the elder Hernandez put her `` through hell . '' Still , Hernandez and his dad are described as very close by another childhood friend , Kristen St. John . She says that she thought at the time of the father 's death , `` This is not good . Aaron is not gon na take this well at all . '' St. John described the period around Dennis Hernandez 's death as `` the turning point of everything in Aaron 's life . '' Hernandez , stunning his family , decided to jilt U-Conn . and his home state altogether not long after , to play football at the University of Florida , where Coach Urban Meyer had built a powerhouse program . - - - He told his mother in a phone call from prison , `` You f -- d my whole life up . '' If Hernandez was well aware that his father could be cruel to his mother , he hardly let her off the hook for his issues . In one call from jail , he tells her , `` I do n't put you down , and you f -- d my whole life up . '' When she protests , he exclaims , `` You did ! But I forgave you , and it 's over with . '' It was n't quite over in that exchange . Hernandez went on to exclaim to his mother , `` I was the happiest f ----- g little kid in the world , and you f -- d me up . And I just lost my father , and I had to go to college . And I had nobody . `` What the f -- did you think I was gon na do , become a perfect angel ? '' Hernandez is then heard telling is mother , `` Oh my god , if I was with you right now , I would have probably punched the -LSB- expletive -RSB- out of you . You bring me to this level . '' In another phone conversation between the two , he explains that he does n't feel he can confide in her , saying , `` You 're going to die without ever even knowing your son . That 's the craziest thing about it . '' - - - He asked after the 2013 season to be traded away from New England The request came shortly after Hernandez allegedly shot Alexander Bradley , a partner in crime both literally and figuratively , in the face .

And Plympton would know , having pitched for the Boston Red Sox for much of the 1991 season and spending parts of four seasons with the Pawtucket Red Sox . But , the sign-stealing scandal that has engulfed the Houston Astros and Red Sox this week is different . It involved technology such as cameras , video monitors and smart watches that Major League Baseball had prohibited as ways to steal signs . The way it worked was , a camera would zoom in on the sign the catcher was giving and team personnel would decode it to determine what type of pitch the catcher wanted the pitcher to throw . Team members on the bench would relay the information to the batter , sometimes by banging on a trash can . As a result of his involvement in the affair , Red Sox manager Alex Cora has been let go by the Sox . And the Astros have fired their manager and general manager . Cora was reportedly involved in the cheating as a bench coach with the Astros and then when he was manager of the Sox . `` -LRB- Sign stealing -RRB- has always been part of the game , but this was high-tech , '' Plympton , now the town of Wrentham 's recreation director , said Wednesday when contacted for comment on the scandal . In his day , a runner on second would look in to see what signs the catcher was flashing and then touch a part of his body to signal to the batter whether to expect a fastball or curve . `` Anything to get some type of an advantage , '' he said . Plympton said the Astros-Red Sox scandal is a `` huge embarrassment '' to Major League Baseball and the teams . Some commentators have said the Astros and Sox should be stripped of their World Series championships in 2017 and 2018 , respectively . At the Larson Senior Center in Attleboro on Wednesday , Jesse Medeiros , 81 , a lifelong New York Yankees fan from Attleboro , said his team was cheated when they lost in the playoffs to the Astros in 2017 and 2019 the Red Sox in 2018 . `` They 're the ones that should be teed off , '' Medeiros said of the Yankees . Jack Gagne , 85 , of Attleboro , said he does n't follow professional sports anymore because all of the players are overpaid `` prima donnas . '' But , he said , he believes all sports teams are trying to cheat , including the Patriots in football . Less than a mile away at Capron Park in Attleboro , David Kadisevskis , 38 , of Attleboro , said he thinks the scandal is `` horrible '' and Cora deserved to be fired . `` That 's not what this country is all about , '' he said . Kadisevskis said anyone associated with the Red Sox should be ashamed of themselves . `` Once a cheater , always a cheater , '' he said .", "url": "https://www.thesunchronicle.com/news/local_news/ex-sox-pitcher-attleboro-area-baseball-fans-thrown-by-sign/article_6aa99824-84b4-5156-8a57-f6f7dd4e6ee6.html", "kws": ["Ex-Sox^^pitcher", "Red^^Sox", "Major^^League^^Baseball", "sign-stealing^^scandal", "Houston^^Astros", "Yankees", "Attleboro", "the^^game", "pitch", "football", "Major^^League", "Boston", "this^^week", "Jeff^^Plympton", "trash", "Wrentham", "Team^^members", "professional^^sports", "Alex^^Cora", "Sign^^stealing"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Baseball": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Baseball_MLB": 1.0}}}

Between the ages of 16 and 27 , the Connecticut native went from being a fun-loving high school star to a well-paid tight end for the Super Bowl-minded Patriots , only to end up committing suicide in prison after being convicted of one Boston-area murder and heavily implicated in two others . Members of Hernandez 's family declined to participate in the series , the executive producers of which are a pair of sportswriters , Dan Wetzel and Kevin Armstrong , who appear frequently in the episodes to recount events . Hernandez can be heard speaking with a number of people close to him , including his mother and his fiancee , in phone conversations recorded while he was in a Bristol County -LRB- Connecticut -RRB- jail . In addition , the series features commentary from childhood friends , law enforcement and prison officials , defense attorneys , journalists and Patriots teammates . Here are the eight most striking details that emerged from `` Killer Inside : The Mind of Aaron Hernandez . '' - - - His high school quarterback said they were in a sexual relationship As with many other aspects of the series , those who followed Hernandez 's saga closely or who happened to catch a relevant headline may already have been familiar with the claims made by Dennis SanSoucie , his quarterback and close friend at Bristol Central High . Those unfamiliar with the claims , however , may well be taken aback to hear SanSoucie say they `` experimented '' sexually . `` We continued because we probably enjoyed it . `` Yes , we were in a relationship back then , '' SanSoucie tells the camera , `` but at the time , you do n't look at it like that . '' Elsewhere in the series , SanSoucie says that when news emerged that Hernandez may have had a lover in prison , his father scoffed and declared that there was no way the stud athlete he knew could be gay . SanSoucie said it took him months after that before he `` broke the news '' about himself and Hernandez . SanSoucie 's father , Tim , sits next to his son and says at one point that he was `` homophobic '' years ago , just as Hernandez 's father was . `` Aaron was extremely terrified of his father finding out , '' Dennis SanSoucie adds . `` I mean , Mr. Hernandez was well known as a man 's man , a father that slapped the -LSB- gay slur -RSB- right out of you . '' While the series is understandably incapable of fully explaining what drove Hernandez to forfeit his lucrative athletic career in favor of the criminality that eventually led to at least one homicide , `` Killer Inside '' posits at several points that his discomfort with his sexual inclinations , or at least the way they might be viewed by others , manifested itself in angry and occasionally violent outbursts . Other potential factors , such as his brain being posthumously discovered with a stunningly advanced case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy -LRB- CTE -RRB- , as well as his father 's abrupt death when he was 16 , are also explored . Yet the possibility that Hernandez was homosexual or bisexual is consistently raised in the series , including by former Patriots offensive lineman Ryan O'Callaghan , who came out as gay after his NFL career ended in 2011 . O'Callaghan appreciated the Patriots culture , pointing out that the team 's focus on winning and mandate to avoid any and all distractions made life easier for him as someone in the closet . He also suggested that Hernandez was extremely concerned about deterring any suspicion regarding his sexuality . `` I think the whole story about Aaron is really unfortunate because you do n't know what drove him to do these things , '' the former offensive lineman declares . `` You know , if he was able to be himself and have some of these negative things not in his life , what kind of difference would that have made ? '' The series also notes that Hernandez 's older brother , DJ Hernandez , wrote in a book that there was a time when Aaron , inspired by female cousins , wanted to become a cheerleader . Their father ended that quickly , DJ claimed . - - - He grew up in such a pro-University of Connecticut family , even their dog was named UConn The Hernandez household was all about the Huskies - for as long as the patriarch , Dennis Hernandez , was alive and providing leadership and stability for young Aaron . The father , known in their Bristol neighborhood as `` The King , '' played at U-Conn . and DJ was a quarterback there who would soon be joined by his star tight end of a sibling . Everything changed , according to several interviewees in the series , after Dennis Hernandez unexpectedly died in 2006 while undergoing hernia surgery . `` Once his father passed , '' the sheriff in charge of the Bristol jail says , '' -LSB- Hernandez -RSB- basically lost the ballast that kept him on course . '' A childhood friend and football teammate , Steven Ziogas , tells us Dennis Hernandez was `` that rock , someone who can set that foundation of values to make sure you 're gon na be a good man , a good father and a good member of the community . '' With his death , Ziogas says , `` Now that 's all gone . '' Dennis Hernandez was n't always a positive role model , though , according to `` Killer Inside . '' DJ Hernandez is seen saying their father had issues with alcohol , and `` if it was n't a good day , you felt it . '' In a phone call to Tanya Singleton , a cousin with whom he was very close , Hernandez describes his father as a good man who possessed a wild side . He also says his father 's relationship was his mother was destructive , suggesting that the elder Hernandez put her `` through hell . '' Still , Hernandez and his dad are described as very close by another childhood friend , Kristen St. John . She says that she thought at the time of the father 's death , `` This is not good . Aaron is not gon na take this well at all . '' St. John described the period around Dennis Hernandez 's death as `` the turning point of everything in Aaron 's life . '' Hernandez , stunning his family , decided to jilt U-Conn . and his home state altogether not long after , to play football at the University of Florida , where Coach Urban Meyer had built a powerhouse program . - - - He told his mother in a phone call from prison , `` You f -- d my whole life up . '' If Hernandez was well aware that his father could be cruel to his mother , he hardly let her off the hook for his issues . In one call from jail , he tells her , `` I do n't put you down , and you f -- d my whole life up . '' When she protests , he exclaims , `` You did ! But I forgave you , and it 's over with . '' It was n't quite over in that exchange . Hernandez went on to exclaim to his mother , `` I was the happiest f ----- g little kid in the world , and you f -- d me up . And I just lost my father , and I had to go to college . And I had nobody . `` What the f -- did you think I was gon na do , become a perfect angel ? '' Hernandez is then heard telling is mother , `` Oh my god , if I was with you right now , I would have probably punched the -LSB- expletive -RSB- out of you . You bring me to this level . '' In another phone conversation between the two , he explains that he does n't feel he can confide in her , saying , `` You 're going to die without ever even knowing your son . That 's the craziest thing about it . '' - - - He asked after the 2013 season to be traded away from New England The request came shortly after Hernandez allegedly shot Alexander Bradley , a partner in crime both literally and figuratively , in the face . It was also several months after the double-murder for which he eventually went on trial , and Hernandez was said to be in a very high state of anxiety , if not outright paranoia . Patriots Coach Bill Belichick turned down the request even though Hernandez said he had some worries about his family 's safety , but the team did suggest some extra security measures and helped Hernandez find an apartment . Tim San Soucie expresses annoyance in the series at the NFL for helping Hernandez find other living arrangements that he found to be secretive in some measure . `` Now the guy 's got a house , why does he need another apartment ?

Elliot was possessed by a horrific , all-powerful monster for nearly all of the season , and it was n't until the finale that he gained control of his body . Now , in Season 5 , the classic Elliot-Margo dynamic is back to form , much to the celebration of fans everywhere . Part of that dynamic includes lines that you just do n't get from other characters . Margo continues to feminize machismo phrases , as she steels Elliot up for a trip deep beneath the surface of the world . `` Oh , grow a cl * t , will you ? '' she says , with exasperation , to which Elliot snaps back , `` B * tch , I would if I could . '' The brief exchange is already a hit with fans online . `` God I missed this show . And it 's great dialogue '' says a fan on Twitter . Another fan says , `` Damn @SummerBishil1 , the way you deliver a line like that is truly pure brilliance . '' Margo 's altering of common phrases like `` Man up '' or `` Grow a pair '' has always been a huge hit with the fans . `` Margo , continuing to be the feminist icon we need and deserve , '' notes one user online . Others are just happy to see Margo and Elliot back together again . `` I missed Margo and Eliot 's sayings/conversations so much , '' says another fan online . The exchange has been typed , tweeted and retweeted over and over again online , and it 's already on its way to being the most memorable of the season -- which is n't bad , for a moment that appears in the season premiere . The exchange was first seen in the trailer , albeit bleeped out , and by all appearances , it works even better in context . The next episode of ` The Magicians ' releases on January 22 on Syfy .

Of the many reasons why some oppose this promotion , is the thought of AIR KELLY returning to South Bend . Can , and more importantly , will Tommy and Lance Taylor run the damn ball effectively ? For 2020 , at least , there is a lot to like in that regard . The Irish return six starters along the offensive line , two of its top three tight ends not named Cole Kmet , running back with experience , and some kid named Chris Tyree . In Tommy 's debut as a playcaller , he showed a dedication to the running game . Against the Iowa St. Cyclones in the Camping World Bowl , Notre Dame ran the ball 38 times against 28 passes . Six of those carries were via Ian Book -LRB- 1 sack in there -RRB- so it was probably -LRB- technically -RRB- more of a 50/50 game . And I 'll take that . The underlying concern from fans is n't really about rush attempts , or yards really , because even when Notre Dame accumulates high totals of both -- they still like to dig down deep and bitch about a 3rd and 2 that the Irish got stuffed on during the game . It 's the short yardage situations in recent years that has frustrated fans the most , especially when Notre Dame 's offensive talent has been far superior to most of the defensive lines across from them . People say that a power running game is more of a mindset and the will do execute , and I ca n't argue with that thought . In fact -- I 'm here to provide a suggestion to help the Irish run the ball in goal line and short yardage situations . BRING BACK THE T FORMATION ! Before you click out of this article , please hear me out -LRB- I 'll keep this very brief -RRB- . The T formation is an old school power formation that has no pre-snap strong side . Irish fans last saw this ran in South Bend back in the Lou Holtz era , and in that version , Notre Dame used it inside the 10 yard line and starting safety Jeff Burris was a BEAST running the ball . In today 's game , a lot of offenses want to spread the field out and look to key in on one-on-one matchups in space -- even on those short yardage and goal line downs . Those plays sometimes involve a 4 or 5 wide set , and offer little threat of a power attack . The T , however , is obviously a very powerful formation -- and it can provide opportunity for some very sneaky attacks with proper use of misdirection and series playcalling . Let 's take a quick look at 3 simple plays ran from a single series . T POWER RIGHT 68 LEAD There is nothing fancy about this . The far side HB gets the handoff from the quarterback and follows the FB and the play side HB into the 6 or 8 hole with step and drive blocking in front . This was the play -LRB- I think -RRB- Burris ran the most . T 13 FB TRAP It 's just a simple fullback trap built off of the power lead . The quarterback opens up to the same side with the fullback taking a counterstep and handoff into the one hole . Not shown above is the RT pulling hard into the hole . T POWER RIGHT FLOOD THROWBACK Another play off of the 68 lead . A simple PA with all action moving right with the pass routes , but the far side HB goes up through the line and drifts out to the flat for a throwback pass . ALL TOO EASY Yes , this is all so ridiculously simple and basic . Perhaps that 's why the Nintendo aesthetic fits so well . That also means it 's easy enough to insert into your playbook without having to change one ounce of your coaching philosophy . All this does is give you another power option when needed . Even if you come out lined up in the T and check into an ACE set with the HBs flexing out wide , there 's a power option . It 's just a simple way to create more options , and it 's one more thing the defense has to prepare for each week . It 's also a major flex -- we are here to knock your ass in the dirt -LRB- hit flex quick slant -RRB- . It 's a suggestion , and I say , `` yes .

Doing the inner work to understand what I was looking for in other people that I could simply give to myself . Viewing every day as an opportunity to make it exactly what I want , and to see the holidays and New Year as a way to continue on the that beautiful and at times , challenging , path . To dismantle where I live in other people 's expectations of what my life and relationships are `` supposed to be . '' And to continue creating my life exactly as I want it to be .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrFN9xN", "title": "10 Recent WWE Feuds Only Vince McMahon Loved", "content": "At the dawn of a new decade , Vince McMahon is still the most powerful person in WWE calling all the shots . Recent years have seen fans upset about WWE 's direction . The belief is that Vince is out of touch and it shows with the presentation of the product . Quite a few storylines and feuds have just left the fan base upset . Let 's take a look at recent feuds that no one seemed to enjoy but McMahon himself . The feuds in question have received many complaints from viewers . No one understood why so much television time was allocated to something that was n't working . These are ten recent WWE feuds that no one liked except Vince McMahon . 10 Roman Reigns vs Baron Corbin The feud between Roman Reigns and Baron Corbin is still going on after months of lackluster television . Reigns getting handcuffed and covered in dog food was an outdated segment that felt so out of place in today 's WWE landscape . Their matches and segments on television always disappoint . WWE finally has Roman getting cheered with almost no boos after returning from his health scare yet choose to waste him in this storyline . Corbin is a Vince favorite that will continue to have a role feuding with Reigns heading into the Royal Rumble . 9 Braun Strowman vs Kevin Owens The idea of Braun Strowman and Kevin Owens having physical matches sounds fun in theory . However , WWE 's presentation of the feud was a huge flop . Vince McMahon was still trying to push Strowman as an attraction performer . Owens felt the brunt of this when taking part in various dangerous spots to make Braun look cooler . The messed up part is that WWE turned Strowman heel right after the storyline . Owens lost a lot of his credibility after getting buried by Braun a few times . 8 Bray Wyatt vs Randy Orton Bray Wyatt 's character has always been booked in a strange manner by WWE . One of the worst ideas came during a long storyline with Randy Orton . WWE built up a team and friendship between Orton and Wyatt before Orton turned on him . The story was going fine until the two started to wrestle . Orton defeated Wyatt in an all-time terrible WWE Championship match at WrestleMania 33 . The two tried to have another bout in a strange House of Horrors match , but this feud was clearly one that missed the mark . 7 Bobby Lashley vs Sami Zayn Bobby Lashley 's return to WWE after his time in Impact Wrestling came in disappointing fashion . Lashley 's first feud came against Sami Zayn and it could have been fun . The problem was with the storyline 's booking . Zayn started insulting Lashley 's family and had three guys impersonating Lashley 's sisters in embarrassing segments . No one benefited from the feud as both wrestlers saw their talents wasted in the worst of ways . 6 Shane McMahon vs The Miz Shane McMahon 's return to WWE saw him become an on-air character for over three years . The role saw Shane running SmackDown as the Commissioner , a move that involved him turning heel . Shane betrayed his former tag team partner , The Miz , to start a feud between the two . Some of SmackDown 's worst moments of 2019 involved Shane and Miz . It grew even worse when Shane won all the big matches . Miz looked foolish always falling short against the non-wrestler , a feud that caused his face character to fall apart . 5 Alexa Bliss vs Bayley Bayley is currently doing well as a heel character and the SmackDown Women 's Champion , but it was a long road to reach this point . Bayley 's momentum as a face ended when she defended the Raw Women 's Championship against Alexa Bliss . WWE went all the way with Bliss , having her defeat Bayley in every match throughout the feud . Segments like `` This is your life , Bayley '' just led to the audience groaning when the two interacted . Their Kendo Stick on a Pole Match ended with Bliss standing tall and Bayley looking like a fool . 4 Braun Strowman vs Tyson Fury A recent risky match between Braun Strowman and Tyson Fury saw WWE trying to bring back the boxer vs wrestler dynamic . Fury has fame in the boxing industry and tried his luck at professional wrestling . WWE wanted a feud between Fury and Strowman heading into Crown Jewel in Saudi Arabia . The segments to build the match were quite embarrassing and made WWE look foolish . Much to the surprise of no one aside from possibly Vince , Strowman and Fury struggled to have a competent match . WWE bringing back Fury would just lead to more poorly remembered moments . 3 Seth Rollins vs Bray Wyatt 2019 saw WWE explore many horrible ideas . Seth Rollins was already losing momentum with the fans as he entered a storyline against Bray Wyatt 's new Fiend persona . The audience would turn on this feud at Hell in a Cell . Between the confusing red light and the non-finish , this feud fell apart with no chances of saving it . Wyatt won the WWE Championship in another disappointing match at Crown Jewel . The feud was so bad for Rollins that a heel turn was needed . 2 Bobby Lashley vs Rusev WWE is currently doubling down on the controversial storyline of Bobby Lashley and Lana vs Rusev . Many embarrassing segments have seen them all coming off like goofs . To add even more confusion , Liv Morgan has now entered the picture as a former lover of Lana . It is hard to see anyone involved in this feud being better off for it once it eventually ends . WWE is banking on it making them stronger characters . Unfortunately , the segments have all been met negatively but , apparently , Vince loves it . 1 Roman Reigns vs Brock Lesnar The longest feud in recent memory saw Vince McMahon trying to make Roman Reigns vs Brock Lesnar a successful attraction . Fans showed no interest in the 2015 feud until Seth Rollins was added to the picture . WWE went back to the well three years later . Reigns and Lesnar continued to face off for the Universal Championship in 2018 until Roman won the title . None of the matches impressed and the audience seemed to not care at all . WWE hurt Reigns immensely by going overboard with this feud .

The Gavin & Stacey actor has told how he swears by the tight underwear which holds in the wearer 's flabby bits , but he is keen to wean himself off it . Dad of three James , who hosts The Late Late Show in the US , said : `` I think I 'm making a sacrifice wearing these Spanx . `` I 'm not even joking . My New Year 's resolution is to try and get to a point where I do one show this year not wearing Spanx . `` It 'll be like I 'm suddenly free , I wo n't know what to do . I 'll be breathing . '' Asked how viewers will know when he has kicked the habit , he added : `` You 'll know , babe . I will shout it from the rooftops . It 'll be my first ever Instagram Story . '' Spanx was launched in 2000 , with a range for men added in 2010 , five years before James started fronting his chat show in Los Angeles . Two years ago he told The Sun he was down to 15st -- a huge 6st lighter than when he made his TV breakthrough in ITV drama Fat Friends in 2000 . He has his own theory about why he struggles with his weight , saying : `` It 's called a metabolism . `` My wife and I went to Mexico and we both weighed ourselves before we went and we ate the same food while we were away . I 'd put on 5lb more than she had . It 's a nightmare . '' Everyone from Kim Kardashian to US actress Lena Dunham has admitted to wearing Spanx , but no famous men have been quite as forthcoming as James . I ca n't say I 've ever resorted to anything like that before , but with celebrities in Hollywood looking as good as Nicole Scherzinger and Thom Evans , I can see why James feels the pressure to look trim on TV . He has clearly got millions of fans in the US , so I 'm sure they 'll love him with or without his Spanx . bizmeter DEMI Lovato will make her long-awaited comeback at the Grammys on January 26 . She is expected to debut a new single , 18 months on from an opioid overdose which saw her hospitalised for two weeks . Her last song , Sober , about her relapse , was in June 2018 . James Blunt has made an emotional video for his song Monsters , in which he cries alongside his dad , who has kidney disease . He decided to give the song 's royalties to the British Legion and Help For Heroes after singing it at the Festival of Remembrance . TWO and a half years after his death , there is new music on the way from Linkin Park 's Chester Bennington . His previous band Grey Daze today release a song , What 's In The Eye , with a full album of material from 1993 to 1996 featuring Chester 's vocals to follow . Whitney Houston will be inducted into America 's Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame on May 2 , 35 years after releasing her self-titled debut album . She will be honoured alongside Depeche Mode , Nine Inch Nails , The Doobie Brothers , T. Rex and The Notorious B.I.G. Fit Nic 's on the glow NICOLE Scherzinger and Thom Evans are utilising every photo op after going public with their relationship at the Golden Globes . The pair were snapped on a romantic night out in Los Angeles on Tuesday and it 's not hard to see why ex-rugby player Thom is so keen on the Pussycat Dolls singer . After meeting on The X Factor : Celebrity , the couple have become inseparable -- even hitting the gym together . Nicole shared a snap on Instagram of her and Thom showing off their abs after a workout and told her 4.2 million followers : `` The only bad workout is the one you do n't do . `` New decade , new week , new mindset , endless possibilities ! '' If ever I need inspiration to hit the gym , this is it . bizbit WITH three Brit Award nods , Mabel is having the last laugh on school bullies . Talking about growing up in Sweden , she said : `` I was dangerously depressed . I stopped going to school when I was 15 or 16 . It was going to be the death of me . My self-esteem was so low . '' On the How To Fail podcast , she added : `` Part of my drive came from wanting to prove the bullies wrong . A few years ago , a boy who was mean to me asked to come to a show -- and I did n't reply . '' It 's Rih 's Fenty panty party RIHANNA gave her fans more than just Wild Thoughts with this sexy lingerie snap . The singer posed in the cosmetics-themed bra and knickers to celebrate her new Savage X Fenty undies line -- after throwing a party in East London for her Fenty Beauty make-up . At the bash , at the Ace Hotel in Shoreditch , a team of make-up artists showed off her cosmetics . While Rihanna did n't join guests , she had worked round the clock on the party . An insider said : `` She is an obsessive with detail and all the staff on the night had been briefed with instructions from her . `` This beauty range is Rihanna 's baby and she has control over every process . `` She insisted on trying every product and personally signed off each one before it went on sale . '' Now we know why that ninth album is taking so long . bizbit QUENTIN Tarantino has revealed who he thinks is the best young actor in Hollywood -- but he has never starred in any of his films . He said : `` I am a huge Chris Pine fan . To me , of the actors of his age , he 's hands down my favourite . '' Maya again ... STORMZY has publicly begged his ex Maya Jama to give him a second chance -- and admitted he wants to marry her . We told in August how the grime artist and Radio 1 DJ had split after four years . But now , in a highly personal interview , he says : `` I love her more than anything . `` I 've never loved anyone like I love her . `` I would love to be the man , do all the things that make this work . `` I want to marry her . `` I want her children . '' He denied cheating but said he `` disrespected her '' by partying with other women after they split . MOST READ IN TV & SHOWBIZ In a YouTube chat with US radio host Charlamagne Tha God , Stormzy said : `` After we split , I was in clubs looking like I did n't give a f *** . I publicly humiliated her . `` This one reckless night and all those things , marriage , kids . . . now you probably wo n't ever . . . you have lost that . `` I did n't know you could break your own heart breaking someone else 's .

After a quickie complete with lots of moaning , we learn the female half -LRB- `` Grace Durkin , '' played by Gage Golightly -RRB- of the sex in the supply hut moment that opens the series is obsessed with her presence on social media . We also learn about her uterus , a little tidbit dropped that 's definitely in the too much information zone . After the couple 's sexcapade , a title bar informs us the show 's set at the NATO Coalition Base Guardian , Laghman Province , Afghanistan . -LRB- The official synopsis note the site 's nickname is `` The Orphanage . '' -RRB- Grace 's sex partner is Cooper Roback -LRB- Sam Keeley -RRB- who goes from his wham bam thank you ma'am moment in the shed to a beating in the ring , courtesy of Sasquatch -LRB- Derek Theler -RRB- . Sasquatch is a beast but Roback attempts to give it his best , aware he has to stay on his feet for three rounds to earn himself and his friends some serious cash . But , no , that 's asking too much . The fight 's called in the second round . Sasquatch appears not to have suffered even a scratch while Roback 's blood flows from multiple orifices . Minutes later , Roback and his squad are in the air preparing to evacuate an injured soldier . They land in what 's normally considered a friendly neighborhood and pick up a soldier who 's been running a side hustle involving rugs -- something he 's obviously not supposed to be doing . An injured man from the village is nearby -LRB- he happens to speak English , German , and French -RRB- and while they 're preparing to evac him , people from the village arrive to ask for medical supplies . The leader 's upset American forces destroyed his village and now refuse to provide supplies to care for his people . Nothing 's resolved by the time they get into the air . Their first patient 's condition deteriorates in transit . They fight to save him , but he passes away because one member of the team , Sgt. Rosa Alvarez -LRB- Cristina Rodlo -RRB- , did n't notice an exit wound in his back . The second patient 's still alive and Roback 's immediately in trouble with Major Sonia Holloway -LRB- Beth Riesgraf -RRB- for landing the bird at The Orphanage when there was a closer hospital to the evacuation available . Roback begs to differ , reminding her the other hospital 's in an area `` that 's a god-damn shooting gallery . '' The problem appears to be that Holloway , the lead doctor at the hospital , is mostly upset it 's an Afghanistan man and not an American soldier taking up one of her beds . Roback explains the guy speaks a million languages , but that does n't soothe the doctor 's ruffled feathers . Those feathers are further ruffled when the men mistakenly roll in with a body bag full of rugs . Major Holloway 's a by-the-book leader and does n't like that Roback 's smuggling rugs , even if he 's doing so to send them to the family of the dead soldier . She 's done with Roback 's shenanigans and wants him to face an Article 15 hearing , meaning he 'll be stripped of his rank as well as other disciplinary actions . Also , he 'll be confined to base . The deceased soldier , Corporal John Buckley , is given a sendoff complete with the playing of `` Taps '' as the men salute their fallen friend . Alvarez is taking Buckley 's death hard . Buckley had a crush on her , and she admits she was always mean to the poor guy . Now , because she missed an exit wound , he 's dead and his blood ca n't be washed from under her fingernails . Roback and Mekhi Davis -LRB- Jeremy Tardy -RRB- attempt to cheer her up and refuse to leave her alone to dwell on the mistake . Alvarez appreciates the gesture but quickly has had enough of their pep talk and leaves . The injured Afghan is on the road to recovery , despite the fact Major Holloway has absolutely no patience with him ... or any bedside manner . Outside on the base , Roback plays ref to a youth soccer game while Davis inoculates the kids against the measles . It 's against orders to do so , but Roback kept a stash of expired vaccines to help the kids because there 's an epidemic sweeping the country . What more trouble can he get into anyway at this point ? When the game wraps up , Roback suggests a scheme he 's just come up with to earn back their money lost during the boxing match . His scheme involves getting the key to the supply hut from Durkin ... something he 's convinced he can do , no problem . No one on the base knows what 's going on between Roback and Durkin and when he takes a seat at her lunch table , she immediately gets up to walk away . Durkin thinks Sasquatch is already suspicious , and Roback admits there 's a rumor going around the base about them . Durkin 's more concerned about pissing off her current boyfriend , Sasquatch , than any rumor . He 's her connection to the weapons manufacturer who pays her to pose with their weapons on Instagram . -LRB- That 's why she was upset her latest photo only had 2,000 likes at the top of the episode . -RRB- She absolutely does not want to lose that source of extra income . She 's saving up to move to LA when her tour 's complete so that she can be her cousin 's stunt double . Roback hints he has a plan that will make them even more money than her Instagram deal . She agrees to get him into the supply hut but calls him out about his interest in her . She realizes Roback just likes to move on other guys ' girlfriends and is n't about to take this relationship seriously . An hour later , they 're back to having sex in the supply hut . Multiple times . She compares her current conquests , describing Sasquatch as having a larger penis yet it 's Roback who actually comes close to giving her an orgasm . -LRB- Their sex talk leaves a lot to be desired . -RRB- Davis arrives in the supply hut as Durkin 's leaving and of course he figures out what 's going on . Chuckling , Davis admits he 's surprised Roback and Durkin actually have something going on . As they 're looking through supplies , Private Anthony Petrocelli -LRB- Nicholas Coombe -RRB- enters the hut and catches them in the act . Even though he likes them as people , he has to report what he found . Roback offers him a part of their business venture instead and Petrocelli leaps at the opportunity . A short while later , Roback and Davis go over their inventory of smallpox vaccines and other supplies that were just going to be tossed out because they expired . Interpreter E. Khalil -LRB- Artur -RRB- , who 's also been cut in on the deal , drags them outside where Alvarez is drunk and up on the roof . She 's ranting about Making America Great Again while asking about a travel agent . Roback reluctantly joins her on the roof and saves her from further humiliation . Meanwhile , Major Holloway 's crawled into bed with her handsome patient . -LRB- She really should thank Roback for bringing the Afghan to her hospital , rather than discipline him . -RRB- Just a few hours prior she had explained she took 40 + pieces of shrapnel from his body . Apparently the offer of sex with the pretty doctor miraculously healed him . Never mind . It 's just a sex dream . Holloway wakes from her sex with a hot patient dream when her husband and kids call to wish her happy birthday . Can I just interject that we 've now seen the main/only female characters either having sex , dreaming of sex , or showing off their bodies while drunk ? Do better , please . Alvarez has to face disciplinary action for her drunken rooftop monologue . Colonel Austin -LRB- Lamont Thompson -RRB- gives her a dressing down but then explains there 's nothing he can do to her because her status has changed . She 's been abruptly discharged . Alvarez is a DACA recipient and her citizenship status is being revoked . She 's not shocked and explains why . `` My father was recently deported while washing dishes in the worst Chinese restaurant in El Paso because someone did n't like their Moo Goo Gai Pan , '' says Alvarez . `` But that should have no bearing on me , sir . I was granted permission to enlist under MAVNI because of my medical skills . And also promised citizenship . '' -LRB- DACA is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals . MAVNI is short for Military Accessions Vital to National Interest . -RRB- There 's nothing Colonel Austin can do . Elsewhere , Roback receives a note from home saying no one is asking questions yet . With the note is a death certificate for Clayton Darryl Roback . He burns both the note and death certificate while looking contemplative . Roback then takes off in an ambulance with Petrocelli , Davis , and their stolen supplies . They drive to the Afghan village and Davis and Roback wander the streets trying to figure out where to deliver their black-market items . They finally figure out the right door to knock on , however they did n't bring their translator who 's in on the deal so they really should have thought to include him . They just stand there unsure of what to do next . -LRB- They did not think this through at all . -RRB- Roback hands over his guns and Davis reluctantly does the same before entering the building . They make small talk among themselves about how the guy in the room looks big enough to take down Sasquatch . Finally , the leader arrives and they show him their supplies and receive their payment of hashish . Roback samples it to make sure it 's grade A . It is . The deal is struck but it 's for just one brick . Davis is furious but since they 've given up their guns , they 're grossly outmanned when the Afghans draw their weapons . Roback quickly comes up with a plan and threatens to torch the medical supplies , whipping out his lighter and dousing the supplies in what everyone thinks is a flammable liquid . -LRB- Even high he knows it 's iodine and not flammable . -RRB- Roback demands the entire box of hashish while holding the flame over the supplies . He and Davis grab the box and make for the ambulance -- grabbing their guns on the way out . Outside , Petrocelli makes friends with a goat that 's thought to be possessed or touched in the head . The village ca n't slaughter it because if you eat it , you may become possessed by the spirit . The Afghan patient 's brother delivers this info while asking about his brother 's condition . Petrocelli 's busy getting water for the goat when the guys rush out to leave . Petrocelli -- not the goat -- is then surrounded by well-armed soldiers from his base , led by Sasquatch . Roback and Davis join Petrocelli and Sasquatch is justifiably confused as to what 's going on . Sasquatch does n't have control over the medics -- his men are part of a different unit stationed at The Orphanage -- so Roback and Davis do n't really care about his presence . Sasquatch does n't explain why but warns Roback and Davis they need to stay far away from this town . Unfortunately , neither Roback nor Davis can remember where they parked the ambulance . By the time they figure it out , the ambulance is on fire . They 'll have to hike back with the hashish strapped to their backs . 68 Whiskey Episode 1 Review : 68 Whiskey comes from Oscar-winning executive producers Ron Howard and Brian Grazer 's Imagine Television Studios and CBS Television Studios , with Emmy Award-nominee Roberto Benabib -LRB- Weeds -RRB- guiding the series as showrunner . The production value 's first-rate -LRB- you ca n't tell it 's the Santa Clarita mountains subbing in for Afghanistan -RRB- , however episode one never settles into a groove . Described as a comedic drama or dark comedy along the lines of M.A.S.H. , episode one nails the dramatic portion but comes up way short on the comedy . There 's kind of a scattershot approach to storytelling that feels like it 's checking off items on a list of hot topics . At least that 's the impression left by the first episode . While watching the latest offering from Paramount Networks -LRB- the network behind the riveting Yellowstone -RRB- , it was difficult to figure out the target audience . The acting 's terrific , with Sam Keeley in particular standing out in episode one . Working in the show 's favor is also the lack of any real competition from other networks in this genre . There was a flurry of military offerings in 2017 , but Valor , SIX , and The Brave quickly wilted . Only SEAL Team continues to hold down a primetime spot and garner high ratings . Since 2017 , most networks have kept their distance from military dramas . Given the current divided state of the U.S. , it 's safer for networks to avoid any mention of wars or the military . But 68 Whiskey is n't playing it safe . The first episode of 68 Whiskey dives into controversial topics and shows members of the military in a less-than-stellar light . Episode one leaves no doubt that the series is going to take risks . 68 's Whiskey ` s first episode had a few intriguing storylines , enough to make me want to check out a few more to see if it finds its footing . This first episode provided little clue as to the season one arc , but it did introduce a couple of characters interesting enough to want to get to know a little better . Plus , I have to stick around to see if there 's an explanation as to why this episode 's titled `` Buckley 's Goat '' when it 's Petrocelli who interacts with the poor thing . I really need that question answered . GRADE : B - * * * * * * * * * * 68 Whiskey premiered on January 15 , 2020 and airs on Wednesdays at 10pm ET/PT on Paramount Network .", "url": "https://www.showbizjunkies.com/tv/68-whiskey-season-1-episode-1-recap/", "kws": ["Whiskey", "dark^^comedy", "Corporal^^John^^Buckley", "Sam^^Keeley", "10pm^^ET/PT", "Clayton^^Darryl^^Roback", "Brian^^Grazer", "happy^^birthday", "Gage^^Golightly", "Cooper^^Roback", "Lamont^^Thompson", "Nicholas^^Coombe", "Sasquatch", "moment", "CBS^^Television^^Studios", "Roback^^hints", "Review", "showrunner", "Major^^Holloway", "Grace^^Durkin"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 0.9960902333259583}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_TV": 0.9960902333259583}, "third_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_TV_ShowsPrograms": 0.9960902333259583}}}

Like many people , I 've started frequenting my local Planet Fitness in Fort Wayne more often in the new year . I go not necessarily just to lose weight , though that would n't be an unwelcome side effect . I find working out helps improve my self-esteem and keep quarter-life crisis anxiety at bay . Last year , however , was the first time I had joined a gym outside of the rec at Ball State . And I must say , I was truly unprepared for the new year rush . Get ready for complaints . I decided to go last week after I got off work , pulling up around 5:30 p.m. Mistake number one . There were not any free spaces in the parking lot . Not a single one . When someone finally left , and I stole their spot , I climbed out of my car and walked through the double doors . It . Was . Packed . The cardio machines were just as occupied as the parking lot . Usually when I go to the gym , I walk or run a couple of miles on the treadmill and then I lift for upper body , lower body or core on an alternating basis . Mistake number two : thinking I could get a good treadmill . Now , look . I 'm picky about which treadmill I use . I do n't want anyone on either side of me , and I also choose a machine near the front doors in the winter so the cool air keeps me from overheating . The only treadmill I could find was sandwiched between two people , one of which thought it was a good idea to bring free weights on the treadmill and do overhead presses while she was walking . And yes , she was grunting with each press , something that I explicitly signed up with Planet Fitness to avoid . I was also glad I had headphones on , since she was talking the ear off of the man who was on the treadmill next to her , who obviously did not know her , and asking where certain machines were and how he thought she should complete her workout . So , once I was sufficiently sweaty , I wiped down my machine and headed toward the weights . It was my favorite day : leg day . I usually do the quad curl first , but there was someone on the one machine my Planet Fitness had . That 's fine , I thought . I 'll do leg press for a bit , then come back . So , I did that . She was still there and not working out . She had been sitting on the machine for a while . I did some calf exercises and waited for her to leave . It had been 10 minutes and she had not done a single rep. What was she doing ? I 'm all for taking a breather between reps and checking your phone , but this was starting to get silly . I was about to break one of the unspoken rules of the gym and ask when she would be done with the machine when a guy who was n't in workout clothes came in , gave her a kiss and they left together . Why ? Why would you hog a machine from a packed gym and not even use it ? Honestly , I 'm fortunate I can afford a cheap gym membership , and other people being around me only slightly inconvenienced me . But goodness , when I 'm running and sweating and it sucks , the last thing I want is someone next to me who is not at the gym to work out , or disrupting others in the process .", "url": "https://www.kpcnews.com/advanceleader/article_2b13123c-c56a-5a74-bc31-ffec3fd3c613.html", "kws": ["workout^^clothes", "treadmill", "free^^weights", "time", "leg^^day", "overhead^^presses", "lose^^weight", "reps", "headphones", "Planet^^Fitness", "upper^^body", "self-esteem", "rush", "leg^^press", "quarter-life^^crisis^^anxiety", "goodness", "Ball^^State", "side^^effect", "complaints", "Fort^^Wayne"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Lifestyle": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Lifestyle_Fitness": 1.0000100135803223}}}

0.0	{"docid": "0NrFr95x", "title": "The Gratuitous B-Movie Column : The Shed", "content": "The Gratuitous B-Movie Column Issue # 539 : The Shed Hello , everyone , and welcome once again to the internets movie review column that has never been attacked by a vampire because , you know , vampires are bullshit , The Gratuitous B-Movie Column , and I am your host Bryan Kristopowitz . In this issue , issue number five hundred and thirty-nine , I take a look at the new low budget horror flick The Shed , now available on Video On Demand , DVD and Blu-ray . The Shed The Shed , directed by Frank Sabatella , is one of those slick , well-made low budget horror flicks where you do n't like any of the characters . That reality is n't by design , as I do think that Sabatella and the producers really want you to like the protagonist of the story but , unfortunately , the protagonist is , too , just awful . The movie is still worth checking out , as it does contain a few actual surprises , but I do wish that there was someone in the movie that I could actually get behind . The Shed stars Jay Jay Warren as Stan , a somber , troubled , hip and edgy high school student that basically hates his life . His parents were killed in some sort of accident , he lives with his asshole grandfather Ellis -LRB- Timothy Bottoms -RRB- , and he 's had various troubles with the law -LRB- he 's on probation -RRB- . Stan 's best friend , Dommer -LRB- Cody Kostro -RRB- , is a troubled douchebag that gets his ass kicked daily by the school bully , Marble -LRB- Chris Petrovski -RRB- . Stan tends to spend most of his free time with Dommer , although those experiences are becoming less and less appealing to Stan with each day -LRB- they often ditch class and go hang out in a field in the middle of nowhere and sit on an old , abandoned couch and drink beer -RRB- . Stan would much rather spend his time with Roxy -LRB- Sofia Happonen -RRB- , his long standing school crush that really is n't interested in him since they hang out in different social circles -LRB- but she does know who Stan is and , to a degree , considers him a kind of friend -RRB- . One day , while walking his grandfather 's dog , Stan is freaked out by something that he finds in his grandfather 's shed . At first , he thinks a crackhead has taken up shop in the shed , but after the crackhead attacks the dog -LRB- rips the poor thing 's head off -RRB- Stan suspects that something else entirely is in the shed . But what ? Grandpa Ellis , pissed that his dog is dead , attempts to enter the shed and deal with the suspected miscreant inside . Ellis does n't survive the encounter . What the hell is in the shed ? The audience knows what 's in the shed . At the very beginning of the movie , we see a hunter -LRB- Bane , as played by Frank Whaley -RRB- being pursued through the woods by a strange humanoid type creature . When Bane eventually confronts the creature face-to-face , Bane is bitten by the creature , which turns out to be a Tobe Hooper 's Salem 's Lot type vampire , and suddenly Bane is a vampire , too . Unable to exist in the sunlight , Bane tries to move from shaded area to shaded area so he can get to a nearby shed and , perhaps , figure out what to do next . That shed , of course , turns out to belong to Ellis . Now alone , Stan has to figure out what to do next . He ca n't go to the authorities as he figures no one will believe his story -LRB- he 's some punk kid on probation . Of course he killed his asshole grandfather -RRB- . Stan eventually tells Dommer about the vampire in the shed and what 's happened . Dommer does n't believe a word of it until he sees the vampire creature for himself . However , instead of becoming worried about the vampire , like Stan , Dommer wants to use the creature to get revenge on Marble and everyone else that has bullied him/treated him like shit his entire life . Will Stan allow his best friend to use the creature to get his revenge , or will Stan find a way to kill the vampire and save lives ? As I said at the beginning , most of the main characters in The Shed are just awful and annoying . You do n't really like any of them and , to a degree , because you do n't like any of them you do n't really care about any of them . You 're certainly curious about what 's going to happen to them as you know that they 're all going to come in contact with the vampire at some point in the movie . But do you necessarily want to see any of them live ? Maybe the sheriff , played by Siobhan Fallon Hogan , as she 's the closest thing the movie has to a sympathetic character , but you also know that she 's probably going to die because she 's a secondary character and secondary characters exist in these kinds of movies to be victims for the vampire . But any of the main characters ? None of them really have to survive . Not really . The movie also takes place in a weird small town and a weird time period . The small town is rural but , at the same time , is n't exactly what you would call a farm town . You think the town might exist somewhere in the south or , maybe , the Midwest , but you 're not quite sure -LRB- the movie never says -RRB- . As for the time period , the high school characters seem to exist in a modern setting , but no one has a cell phone and you get the sense that the movie could actually be taking place in the late 1980 's / early 1990 's . No one has a flat screen TV and you can watch Roger Corman 's The Terror on TV late at night . And Stan has a Walkman . The lack of a specific setting was likely meant to make the movie seem timeless , but all it does is make you wonder about the actual time period . That is n't a good thing , in this case . It 's distracting . The Shed also has pacing issues . Everything should be happening faster than it does . The movie is never really boring , but there are times where you 'll want the plot to move ahead quicker . We know what 's in the shed , so why keep acting like we do n't ? Perhaps if the movie did n't feature that opening vampire attack sequence , forcing the audience to wonder , along with Stan , what the hell is in the shed , the pacing the movie currently has would have worked . Maybe . The movie 's special make-up effects are well done and quite gory . There 's a terrific bloody arm removal scene and there 's plenty of blood thrown around , which is what you want in a vampire movie . The look of the vampires is also cool as hell . Yes , the Bane vampire sort of looks like a zombie , but when he 's hidden in the shadows he 's scary as hell . And I love the bug eyed , glowing eyes vampire look of Bane 's victims/vampire henchmen . That wild eyed stare look always seems to work . The movie 's soundtrack and sound design is also well done . The outside shell of the shed is also well done . Even before Bane decides to hide out in it the shed looks like a structure you want nothing to do with . The shed interior is just some dark place with random streaks of light in it . A vampire getting momentarily burned by moving past those streaks is an idea the movie never does anything with . I know that I 'm supposed to sympathize with Stan since his life is terrible and his parents were killed and all that , but Jay Jay Warren never once makes you want to like him . Even when he 's getting his ass kicked by Marble or Grandpa Ellis you want to grab him by his shirt collar and scream into his face `` Get over yourself , son ! Stop being an asshole like everyone else in this town ! '' And his indecisiveness later on , when he 's trying to figure out how to proceed after Ellis is killed , is just annoying . Just go kill the vampire and go ask Roxy out on a date and get on with your life , man . Cody Kostro also never allows you to like his character Dommer . It 's not cool that he gets his ass kicked every day by bullies but , at the same time , does he have to be such a goddamn douchebag the rest of the time ? Why the hell does Stan hang out with him ? Why did Stan ever want to hang out with him in the first place ? I 've never wanted to see a potential protagonist character die horribly so much in my life . Sofia Happonen does an okay job with Roxy . For a good chunk of the movie it seems like the only reason she 's in the movie is the movie needed another female character besides the sheriff and Stan needed a potential love interest . It would be nice if Warren and Happonen had an ounce of romantic chemistry but they really do n't . And while Happonen is sort of naturally appealing , her big `` deep conversation '' with Stan is so excruciating you end up wanting her to die , too . That should n't happen but it does . Timothy Bottoms is terrific as Stan 's grandfather Ellis . He makes Ellis a loudmouth , belligerent piece of shit , which is what he 's supposed to be . I am curious to know if Ellis was an asshole Stan 's entire life or if he became an asshole later on , like when Stan 's parents died . Did he lose it and become an asshole because he felt like he was saddled with a no good teenager ? If he was an asshole his entire life , my God , how did he live as long as he did ? Why did n't some non-vampire stab him in the neck thirty years ago ? You will remember Bottoms . Chris Petrovski is a perfect bully as Marble . He 's got the swagger , the longish hair , and the badass Trans-Am , which is what all bully assholes had in the 1980 's and , to a lesser extent , the 1990 's . Marble also had two lackeys with him all of the time , something all of the top movie bullies had back in the day . I 'm surprised he did n't get his ass kicked sooner in his life . Siobhan Fallon Hogan is , as I said earlier , the closest thing the movie has to a truly sympathetic character . She 's got a soft spot for Stan because she knows what kind of shit he 's gone through , but she 's also leery of him because he is a delinquent . What happens to her is just horrific . I think it 's high time someone makes an action movie where she , as the town 's sheriff , has to take on a drug gang or mobsters or some shit like that . I 'd watch that movie . And then there 's Frank Whaley as Bane , the hunter that becomes the vampire in the shed . He does a good job as the vampire but , at the same time , why is he the vampire ? Why is n't he someone else in the movie , like a character that has actual dialogue ? Why is n't he the school principal or someone like that ? At least his make-up is nasty looking . The Shed has issues , yes , but it 's still a new low budget horror movie worth checking out . It could be better , but it has enough good stuff in it to make it worthwhile .

Yeah ! ** Things to Watch Out For -- Running with the Devil : Another week , another new low budget Nicolas Cage movie . In this one , Cage co-stars with Larry Fishburne , Barry Pepper , Leslie Bibb , Peter Facinelli , Cole Hauser , Clifton Collins , Jr. , Adam Goldberg , and Natalia Reyes , and it 's all about cocaine . Based on the trailer , it looks like Fishburne is the head of a cocaine cartel or some shit like that , something bad happens , and Cage is brought in to somehow `` fix '' whatever happened . The movie looks kind of sleazy and disreputable , which probably means it 's entertaining and morally reprehensible . Worth a rental , no doubt . And , man , I really need to watch more of these low budget Nicolas Cage movies . I feel as though I 'm missing out on something potentially spectacular . -- Beyond the Law : This is a new low budget Steven Seagal action movie , and DMX and Johnny Messner are in it , too -LRB- the immortal Bill Cobbs , Zack Ward , and Patrick Kilpatrick are in it , too -RRB- . I have no idea what it 's about . I mean , DMX is apparently playing a cop , and Seagal might be playing a cop , and , I guess , Messner is playing an ex-cop of some sort . It takes place in a city with lots of crime . Seagal beats some people up for some reason . I have a feeling this is going to be bland/kind of bad , but , at the same time , I 'm hoping it 's great in its own way . Definitely worth a rental , or a purchase if you 're one of those Seagal completists . -- Line of Duty : This new low budget action flick from director Steven C. Miller -LRB- he did the awesome Escape Plan 2 : Hades -RRB- that 's been getting stellar reviews since its limited theatrical release at the end of last year . The movie stars Aaron Eckhart as a cop that 's in a race against time for some reason . Giancarlo Esposito and the perpetually gorgeous Dina Meyer are also in it . This is definitely something I plan on seeing soon , based solely on the reviews and the presence of director Miller . And , well , the trailer is fabulous . Anyone out there see this yet ? Anyone at all ? -- Girl on the Third Floor : Modern pro wrestling legend C.M. Punk stars in this new low budget horror flick that 's been getting all sorts of buzz since its film festival debut in March of last year . Punk apparently plays a guy that 's renovating a haunted house , and in the process of doing that weird shit happens -LRB- of course it does -RRB- . This is Punk 's first big deal starring role , and , heck , if his performance is as good as the reviews say it is , movie acting could be the next thing he tries to do , and that would be cool , would n't it ? Definitely want to see this and then , after this -LRB- he 's also in that Rabid remake the Soska Sisters did but I believe that was n't a starring role -RRB- , what kind of movie will he do next ? Another horror movie ? An action movie ? -- Gemini Man : I actually managed to see this big budget sci-fi action flick starring Will Smith and directed by Ang Lee when it was in theatres and it was ... okay . It has its moments , but as an `` event '' movie , it 's seriously lacking . The special effects are dodgy at best , especially the Will Smith clone part , the movie does n't have enough action in it , and Will Smith himself is all wrong for the part . I mean , Will Smith can do an action movie , sure , but do you really want to see the Will Smith of now fight a younger version of himself ? Why ? He just does n't have that badass aura that a guy like Denzel Washington or Tommy Lee Jones would have , or a legit action star like Stallone or Ahnold would most definitely have . Still , Gemini Man is okay/decent and worth seeing at least once . I do hope that someone , some day , writes a book about how long this movie was in development . I know that would be fascinating . Did anyone out there see this in that High Frame Rate 3D ? ** Next Issue : It 's the new action flick The Mercenary directed by Jesse V.

I have some recommendations ! While I 'm sending all my love to the incredible Ice Adolescence animators who are working their butts off to bring us something amazing , I 've got to admit that I 'm craving some queer anime content . Badly . I feel like a lot of us are looking for this . Hopefully you 'll find something here to take care of your needs while we wait . There 's a lot of queer anime titles out there and everyone 's personal tastes vary , so my list here may or may not recommend your favorite titles . However , I selected some of the best titles I 've personally experienced in my 20 + years of anime viewing , and hope that maybe you 'll find a new one to pass the time until the Yuri on Ice movie comes out hopefully sometime this year . My selection criteria took into consideration common elements from Yuri on Ice that I noticed appealed to many fans of the series . They feature strong plots , beautiful artwork , humor -LRB- to varying degrees -RRB- , and meaningful same-sex relationships . Most of them also have some pretty rad music , too . Outside of that , these titles vary in scope , setting , and genre . Some titles were also placed on this list for their significance in overall queer anime history , so if you 're interested in the evolution of representation in this medium , you 'll have some major touchstones to experience from this list as well . So without further ado , please check out these four queer anime titles -LRB- and one donghua ! -RRB- that 'll help pass the time while we patiently wait for Ice Adolescence . -- Given Genre : BL , Drama , Romance Episodes : 11 Availability : Streaming on Crunchyroll Trigger Warning : Highlight or copy/paste for spoiler -- Character Suicide Initiates Main Plot Unlike Yuri on Ice , Given is unequivocally categorized as BL and marketed as such accordingly . Despite that , it does n't fall into a lot of the pitfalls a lot of BL stories tend to do . It has a comparatively healthy and naturally-developed romance . Many fans of Yuri on Ice have praised that aspect of the show , so if that 's your jam , please consider this title , too . Given follows the story of Ritsuka , an incredibly gifted guitarist who has found himself in somewhat of a slump in regards to music . Then he meets Mafuyu , a boy who is carrying around a guitar that clearly has no idea how to actually play it . Mafuyu becomes insistent on learning the instrument , however , and Ritsuka , to almost everyone 's surprise , starts to earnestly teach him how to do so . What follows is eleven episodes of emotional , often painful , and incredibly real character-driven plot that 'll leave you with more emotions than you likely know how to handle . But do n't let the drama of it all fool you . There are quite a few funny moments to break up the sadness , and it 's overall a very heartwarming story . The pain is worth it . Trust me . As this is a story about a band , you can count on the music being absolutely fantastic as well . The song Fuyu no Hanashi from episode 9 is particularly amazing and I 'm almost ashamed to admit just how much I 've listened to it . Well over 100 times , if I 'm being conservative with my estimate . I would post that song to entice you , but the nine episodes preceding it are important to have the full emotional impact . Instead , please enjoy the title sequence to set the mood . No. 6 Genre : BL , Science Fiction , Dystopian Episodes : 11 Availability : Streaming on Crunchyroll This is an `` older '' title -LRB- relatively speaking -RRB- on the list , with the novels that inspired it released starting in 2003 and the anime debuting in 2011 . That said , despite the fact that Yuri on Ice got way more attention just five years later , I mark this as the first major shift in queer anime content . This is especially true for the BL genre specifically . No. 6 focuses more on the plot than a lot of BL titles do , and lets the romance develop naturally as the story unfolds . There 's a huge overlap between No. 6 fans and Yuri on Ice fans , and the way the romance is told in relation to the plot is a huge reason why . There 's a lot of similarities . No 6 takes place in a dystopian future where the elite live in large walled-off cities , while the less fortunate struggle to survive outside the gates . One of the young privileged residents of the city No. 6 , Shion , gives shelter to another boy , a wanted fugitive named Nezumi . Shion helps tend to a bullet wound Nezumi sustained while running from authorities and eventually suffers repercussions for this action . Years later Shion and Nezumi , now adults , meet again and together they work on unraveling the dark mysteries behind No 6 . If you 're a fan of genre media , particular genres that lean dystopian and science fiction , you 'll love this one . I find myself going back to it every year or so because it 's just so good . There 's a lot to unpack in the narrative , which touches on class , government corruption , and themes about sciences and the arts . It 's a really rich narrative to explore and I 'm always finding something new to analyze . Revolutionary Girl Utena Genre : Fantasy , Romance , Surrealism Episodes : 39 Availability : Amazon Prime Video This late 90 's anime was my gay awakening , so it 's going on the list despite its differences from many of the others . First and foremost , this is the only same-sex relationship between two women on this list . Secondly , it is by far the oldest title at twenty three years . Thirdly , it 's largely surrealist and leans heavily on stylization and symbolism over a straightforward narrative . So it 's not a perfect fit with the Yuri on Ice fanbase , but it 's on the list anyway for its significance . It 's queer anime history and I consider it a must-watch for everyone who wants to be educated about the genre . It 's a touchstone for queer anime that is still influential today -LRB- see : Steven Universe -RRB- . It will hold a special place in my heart for the rest of my life . The story follows Utena Tenjou , a tomboyish high school student who dreams of becoming a prince . She gets drawn into a series of sword duels , unintentionally winning possession of the mysterious ` Rose Bride ' who has the power to `` revolutionize the world '' . Over the course of these increasingly competitive duels , she becomes protective of the Rose Bride , becoming one of the few people who view her as an individual and not just a prize to be won . But not everything is as it seems . Sound weird as hell ? That 's because it is . And yet somehow you ca n't look away from it all . Between the incredible artwork , catchy soundtrack , and fierce action sequences , you can get past the weirdness if that was initially off-putting for you . You may even get to the point where you appreciate just how bizarre it can be and consider it part of its charm . Here 's the opening title sequence to give you a taste of how the style , music , and animation all vibe together : There is also an Utena film , but I do n't recommending watching it until you 've seen the show itself . It 's a highly condensed version of the story with the stylization and surrealism turned up to the max . If you end up enjoying the show , however , give it a watch ! It has some of the most beautiful animation from this era of anime . It 's gorgeous . Warning : There is nudity in the movie -LRB- but not in the show -RRB- . Promare Genre : Science Fiction , Mecha , Action Episodes : 1 Films , 2 Animated Shorts Availability : Limited Theater Run , DVD/Blu-ray Coming Soon There 's some debate about the queerness of Promare , which many Yuri on Ice fans will ironically also relate to . In order for me to adequately prepare you for just how queer it gets , I need to go over a spoiler -LRB- just like Yuri on Ice ! Yeah , this feels familiar , does n't it ? -RRB- . I 'm going to drop that spoiler behind some spoiler text so that those that want to know just what they 're getting can look , but those that want to go in blind can do so . Highlight or copy/paste the following to find out more : The two main characters , Galo and Lio , share a life-saving kiss . Many people dismiss this as something akin to CPR . The actual context is that Lio is near-death and Galo uses his lips to transfer flame to him to resurrect him . The framing of this scene lingers , which was n't necessary , and the surrounding context conveys that these two have grown incredibly close . The `` it was n't a kiss ! '' discourse is exactly what we went through in the Yuri on Ice fandom , so I think most of you will be fine . Still , for those that want no questions about whether a romance has developed between these characters , this may bother you a bit . The story takes place in a dystopian future where a portion of humanity has evolved into fire-wielding people known as the `` Burnish '' . During what at first appears to be a routine fire call , firefighter Galo Thymos finds himself face-to-face with the leader of a terrorist organization known as ` The Mad Burnish '' . He gets pulled into an unexpected journey involving corruption , conspiracies , and a looming apocalypse . Of all the titles on this list , this soundtrack is the most intense . It 's my background music for most of the day , honestly . So if music is a factor in which title you choose to watch , this one will likely be near the top of your list . It slaps , yo . The biggest issue with this one is the availability . It only had a limited release in theaters at the tail end of 2019 and the official English DVD/Blu-rays does n't have a release date . So , quite simply , you may not be able to get easy access to this . However , the Japanese release is scheduled for February 5th . So if your Japanese is decent , you can get access to it that way . -- Mo Dao Zu Shi -LRB- + 1 Donghua -RRB- Genre : Xianxia , Action , Adventure , Mystery , BL * Episodes : 23 -LRB- Ongoing -RRB- Availability : Streaming on YouTube -LRB- legally , for real ! -RRB- * BL categorization note : The novel is explicitly queer , but the donghua has n't reached the point in the story where the romance becomes apparent . It may or may not be straight-washed , but the romantic undertones are very clearly present already . This is technically not an anime , but rather a donghua . This particular title came from China . However , once you get past the language barrier and get used to some linguistic and cultural differences , you 'll realize it has a lot of the same appeal as anime . I hope you 'll step out of your comfort zone and give it a shot ! I just wrote a recommendation for this one a month ago , so forgive me for a moment as I directly quote myself for the summary : The story follows Wei Wuxian , a spiritual cultivator who died 13 years prior to the start of the story . He was a controversial figure in his time as he used the ` dark arts ' to utilize his magic . He becomes known as the founder of the Demonic Path as a result of this practice . When the series begins , a man named Mo Xuanyu decides to sacrifice his soul to bring Wei Wuxian back to life . In doing so , Wuxian would resurrect in Xuanyu 's body . The ritual works , and Wei Wuxian returns , slightly confused at his unexpected resurrection , but ready to do whatever task Xuanyu has summoned him to do . Wei Wuxian gets a surprise second chance at life , but he 's haunted by the reputation he left behind prior to his death . He quickly finds himself interacting with people he knew before he died , some of whom suspect his true identity and some who do n't . He embarks on adventures fighting monsters and solving mysteries across the countryside , dealing with the fallout from his previous life along the way . This is my current hyperfixation . I ca n't possibly sing the praises of this story highly enough . In the past month I 've watched the 23 episode donghua -LRB- the thing I 'm currently recommending -RRB- , read the 113-chapter novel , and read the 102 chapters of the fan-translated manhua . I 've also read and written a ton of fanfiction . This has basically been my life for the last month , guys . Seriously . I 've done little else . As noted in the above addendum to categorizing it as BL , the donghua has n't gotten to the more straightforward presentation of their blossoming relationship that 's portrayed in the novel , so I 'm not sure just how blatant it 's going to get . But the live-action drama version of the story , while it cuts out the explicit scenes , still has incredibly queer undertones that are hard to deny . A third season of the donghua is coming our way , so we 'll all soon find out just how queer it 's going to get . In order to tell the entire story , this could be stretched out into seven or eight seasons at its current pace . I have no idea how many we 're actually going to get , so the relationship development will be largely contingent on Tencent granting us further seasons . Here 's the season 2 opening title sequence to give you a taste of the animation and music : Warning For The Novel : The main 113 chapters feature a couple dub-con scenes . An additional extra chapter features a mature scene involving teenagers . Neither element is present in the donghua so far , and I doubt the extra chapter scene will be in any of the versions still in progress -LRB- though we wo n't know until we get there , of course -RRB- . Mo Dao Zu Shi Watch Party -LRB- Season 1 -RRB- -- What queer anime titles do you recommend ? As stated , there 's a lot of queer anime -LRB- and donghua -RRB- titles out there , so I know that you 'll probably have a favorite not mentioned here . But again , hopefully you 'll find something new , too .

Robert Thomas hits Alexander Steen with a pass behind the net . Steen then passes the puck to a wide open Faulk for the easy one timer that beat former Blues goalie Brian Elliott . It was the only bright spot for the power play though , as it went 1 for 6 on the night . That also included some extended 5 on 3 time . Faulk from Steen -LRB- 10 -RRB- and Thomas -LRB- 18 -RRB- . 1-0 Blues . That 'd be the only goal scored in the period . Shots on goal were 14-8 in favor of the Blues . Second Period - With some puck luck , Tyler Pitlick tied the game at one . Pitlick skated in behind the net and threw the puck back out front . The puck looked to have bounced off of either David Perron or Alex Pietrangelo 's skate and past Binnington . Pitlick scored his fifth of the year with Laughton -LRB- 6 -RRB- and Niskanen -LRB- 13 -RRB- on the assists . Exactly three minutes later , the Flyers scored again . Michael Raffl was able to gather a rebound in front . He fired the puck off the post and past Binnington giving the Flyers a 2-1 lead . It figured that they hit the post on this goal after already having hit two posts in the period . Fifth goal of the year scored by Raffl with Hagg -LRB- 6 -RRB- and Couturier -LRB- 27 -RRB- assisting . Shots in the period were 9-8 for the Flyers despite them not having a shot on goal in the first nine minutes or so of the period . Third Period - At the end of the second period Perron was given two minutes for cross checking . He was caught retaliating after Travis Konechy had started shit with Perron . They both should have gone in my opinion , but instead it was just Perron in the box . And on the ensuing power play Konechy -LRB- 15 -RRB- scored to give the Flyers a two goal lead . James van Riemsdyk -LRB- 13 -RRB- / Giroux -LRB- 19 -RRB- Ryan O'Reilly scored his 9th goal of the year on his own rebound chance . O'Reilly attempted to redirect a feed on net from Schenn . Elliott made the initial save , but O'Reilly was able to shoot the puck under Elliott pulling the Blues back to within one . Schenn -LRB- 24 -RRB- / Perron -LRB- 27 -RRB- with the assists . Alexander Steen tied the game thanks to yet another great set up from one Robert Thomas . Schwartz was able to move the puck around to Thomas . Thomas fired the still moving puck to Steen in front of the net . Steen was then able to backhand the puck past Elliott . Steen -LRB- 4 -RRB- from Thomas -LRB- 19 -RRB- and Schwartz -LRB- 24 -RRB- Overtime - The Blues managed to salvage a point in this one . Unfortunately , the Flyers came out on top in this one . Jakub Voracek scored the game winner and ended the Blues home win streak . The Blues had their chances , but could n't capitalize and it bit them in the ass tonight . Still , they managed to salvage a point and remain on top of the West , and the NHL . So there 's that . They go out to Colorado to take on the Avs on Saturday . These tweets also hit the post .

Tyler , The Creator : IGOR -LRB- 2019 -RRB- Tyler , The Creator 's evolution throughout his career has been interesting to watch . From his Odd Future days , to his early albums , to his most recent work , the tone and maturity of Tyler has been pretty remarkably different . On IGOR , Tyler 's heartfelt and vulnerable writing meshes with his elaborate and nuanced production to create a listening experience that feels like a mystical journey through Tyler 's emotions and his complications within his love and relationships . This is an album that truly pushes the boundaries of the hip-hop genre , experimenting with the synthesis of many different genres , including neo-soul , pop and funk . It is hard to be able to tell the long-term impact of this album in the moment given its relatively recent release , but IGOR will likely prove to serve as one of the most impactful experimental hip-hop albums to come out of this decade . Favorite Songs : `` A Boy is a Gun '' , `` Earfquake '' , `` Gone , Gone / Thank You '' , `` Are We Still Friends ? '' 99 . Migos : Culture -LRB- 2017 -RRB- Migos were able to put together their most complete album in their discography with Culture . The Atlanta trio has never been known -LRB- and will never be known -RRB- for intricate wordplay or conceptual work . However , Culture does a great job in achieving what it is aiming for . Setting the bar for much of the modern southern trap scene , this album provides an energy and an authentic southern bounce over iconic trap production . Donald Glover claimed that Migos were `` The Beatles of This Generation '' , and while that statement may be a reach , the Migos did provide a classic trap album with true cultural influence that they targeted . Favorite Songs : `` T-Shirt '' , `` Bad and Boujee '' , `` Call Casting '' 98 . Kota The Friend : FOTO -LRB- 2019 -RRB- A mellow and smooth listen from front to back , FOTO provides one of the most well constructed lo-fi hip-hop records of the decade . The 27-year-old rapper from Brooklyn offers a vulnerable and calm journey through his childhood , his current life and his philosophy . An immensely personal album , Kota creates moving music through fairly simple and pleasant production and relaxed flows . Kota 's ability to build off of the sound and personality built in his earlier music with constantly evolving levels of maturity and technical ability make FOTO a great listen . Favorite Songs : `` Solar Return '' , `` Chicago Diner '' , `` Full Bloom '' , `` For Colored Boys '' 97 . 2 Chainz : Pretty Girls Like Trap Music -LRB- 2017 -RRB- On Pretty Girls Like Trap Music , 2 Chainz shows how to effectively evolve in rap music without completely leaving behind a familiar sound . A great job is done in developing and refining the sound that the southern rap veteran has become associated with while experimenting with new ways of presenting it . Providing a handful of enjoyable `` party '' songs , 2 Chainz was able to create a fun and complete collection . This album is one of the primary examples of how trap music can be made fun and appealing to mainstream audiences while staying true to its roots . Favorite Songs : `` Riverdale Rd '' , `` Good Drank '' , `` Burglar Bars '' , `` 4 AM '' 96 . Mac Miller : The Divine Feminine -LRB- 2016 -RRB- The Divine Feminine was Mac 's attempt at experimenting with making a love album that utilized elements of jazz rap and neo-soul in ways that he previously had n't gone as deep with . The result of this experiment was Mac 's most cohesive and consistent project and a great album that accomplished his goals . Singing significantly more on this project than on his previous works , Mac really aims for a different feel with The Divine Feminine . Although his singing voice is certainly far from the best , his imperfect vocals almost make him a more personable figure to follow through this journey throughout his love . From front to back , there is a degree of focus that far exceeds much of his earlier work . With features from Anderson . Paak , Kendrick Lamar , Ariana Grande , CeeLo Green and Bilal , the whole album oozes soul and emotion . Mac 's Divine Feminine was a triumphant journey through his world of emotions . Favorite Songs : `` God Is Fair , Sexy , Nasty '' , `` Planet God Damn '' , `` Stay '' , `` Dang ! '' 95 . Future : Dirty Sprite 2 -LRB- 2015 -RRB- Future 's brutally honest journey through his chaotic life provides one of the landmark trap albums of the decade . Future 's music is sometimes criticized for its simplicity or lack of substance -LRB- and to be fair , these claims are well justified in some of his projects -RRB- , but DS2 is much more than a simple trap album with club bangers . There is a deep drive and hunger within Future that manifests to make an epic and almost cinematic listen . A dark album that explores the tormented state of Future 's life and mind , DS2 culminates in Future 's most focused and most influential work . Favorite Songs : `` Slave Master '' , `` Kno The Meaning '' , `` The Percocet & Stripper Joint '' 94 . Schoolboy Q : Oxymoron -LRB- 2014 -RRB- Top Dawg Entertainment 's very own , Schoolboy Q , fights to make sure that Gangster Rap gets a fresh adjustment in sound while remaining true to its roots . Oxymoron is a focused , gritty , and bleak album that encompasses a sound that Schoolboy Q has refined with great precision . The primarily dark and intense production throughout blends very well with the often dark and intense lyrics and tone that are delivered . An undeniable hunger and passion is exuded for the duration of the project , and the modern west-coast gangster rap album that Q was hoping for was achieved . Favorite Songs : `` Man Of The Year '' , `` Collard Greens '' , `` Hell of a Night '' 93 . Childish Gambino : Because The Internet -LRB- 2013 -RRB- What ca n't Donald Glover do ? Donald Glover had arguably the most interesting decade of any rapper . The 2010s saw Glover release three studio albums , five mixtapes , three extended plays ; win song of the year and record of the year at the Grammys for `` This is America '' ; voice Simba in the live action remake of The Lion King ; play Lando Calrissian in Solo : A Star Wars Story and executive produce , direct , write and act in his critically acclaimed television series Atlanta . In the midst of this prolific decade for the modern-day renaissance man , Because The Internet served as one of the most fascinating and bold efforts put forth by a rapper . Gambino refines many of the severely immature aspects of his younger rap work , while maintaining the energy and creativity that make him such a likeable personality . Favorite Songs : `` 3005 '' , `` Telegraph Ave. '' , `` Sweatpants '' , `` The Worst Guys '' 92 . Drake : If You 're Reading This , It 's Too Late -LRB- 2015 -RRB- A rapper that needs no introduction . With seven chart-topping solo albums over the last decade , Drake 's success speaks for itself . Sure , popularity does n't correlate directly to quality , but Drake has put out some of the most quality work of the past decade in the genre . If You 're Reading This , It 's Too Late is an immensely confident work that shows that Drake knows exactly where he stands in hip-hop . A variety of refined and epic production , flows and themes , IYRTITL provides some of Drake 's most quintessential music . Favorite Songs : `` Jungle '' , `` 6 PM in New York '' , `` Legend '' , `` 6 God '' , `` No Tellin ''' 91 . Noname : Room 25 -LRB- 2018 -RRB- It is hard to find many rap albums over the past decade that would commonly be described as having a `` sweet '' or `` bubbly '' sound , but Room 25 is certainly one of them . Noname , the Chicago wordsmith , began her rise to prominence with her fantastic early collaborations with Chance The Rapper and has since proved her incredible solo talent . Noname is able to relay her thoughts , her struggles , and her life in a truly special way over elegant production . Room 25 is a coming-of-age record for Noname that is triumphant and powerful while soothing and beautiful . Favorite Songs : `` Ace '' , `` Do n't Forget About Me '' , `` With You '' After every segment of my Top 100 rankings are published , I will be creating a Spotify playlist with my favorite songs from the albums that are in each section . Just go to my Spotify Profile -LRB- @nicholassligh -RRB- where I will be posting the playlists in descending order of rank . Go to this link to view this week 's playlist for the albums ranked # 100-91 ! I hope that my list gives credit to deserving artists and helps people that enjoy hip-hop and rap -LRB- and even those less familiar with the genre -RRB- to find new music that connects with them and that they simply enjoy .", "url": "https://www.stanforddaily.com/2020/01/15/top-100-hip-hop-rap-albums-of-the-decade-100-91/", "kws": ["albums", "rap^^music", "song", "Solo", "club^^bangers", "Trap^^Music", "Grammys", "Gangster^^Rap", "iconic^^trap^^production", "DS2", "sound", "neo-soul", "Migos", "mainstream^^audiences", "Kendrick^^Lamar", "blends", "Legend", "IYRTITL", "Chainz", "deserving^^artists"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Music": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Music_HipHop": 1.0000100135803223}}}

After all , foreplay is incredibly important when it comes to knowing how to please a woman in bed , and fingering is a huge part what 's needed in order to stimulate her properly and get her turned on . So guys , if you really want to make sure she has the best sex of her life , make sure your fingering skills are up to the task that 's literally at hand . Here are seven expert tips on how to finger a girl the right way in order to give her super intense orgasms during foreplay and/or sex . 1 . Keep your fingernails neat and trim . Ohhh , so that 's why women are always checking out men 's fingernails ? They 're all thinking about a fingering . Yes . Yes , they are . Seriously , uncut , uncleaned , and unbuffed fingernails are painful , so keep your hands to yourself until your nails are smooth enough to run across your own dick hole . 2 . Make circles on her clitoris . The clitoris is the most powerful spot on a woman 's body , so get ready to use two fingers -LRB- the index and middle finger -RRB- to rub her clitoris in a soft and circular manner . By now she should be sufficiently aroused with foreplay , so her clitoris will be swelling and slightly enlarged . Gradually increase speed as she shows positive signs . Be careful not to lose concentration and `` auto '' set your circles , as you could lose the rhythm or start moving too roughly or quickly . 3 . Penetrate her with your middle finger . If she wants it hard and fast , try putting your middle finger inside of her , then thrust it in and out of her like a penis . Increase the speed if she seems to like it and find a thrusting pattern that works . The ideal position is with you in front of her vagina and kneeling in front of her since this gives you full control over your hand . 4 . Find her G-spot with the index and middle finger . Next in how to finger a woman , we find the G-spot . The G-spot is located about 2-3 inches deep and upwards , towards the front wall . You should feel a rougher patch of skin when you find it . Find this area by facing your palm up and making the `` come here '' motion with your middle and index fingers.Imagine trying to touch her belly button internally and you 've got the right idea . Start slowly and softly , building up to a hard thrust . 5 . Slide your index and middle fingers all the way down and back up again . Make sure your fingers are wet , and then , start by going down the side of the clitoris all the way into her vagina and then back out again . This common maneuver of the tongue can also work with fingers , as long as you keep the pressure light and the area very wet . 6 . Bring in your other hand . You can use your free hand to stimulate her vagina or G-spot area while rubbing her clitoris at the same time . When using more hands , try stroking and penetrating with different rhythms , not automating the same movement for both hands . Keep it steady and do n't worry about speed unless she 's yelling at you to finish her off . 7 . Do n't shock her ... use the shocker ! There 's only one rule about anal stimulation and it 's `` No surprises ! '' If your woman is up for some experimenting , then use your pinky finger to lightly penetrate her anus . Make sure your hand is sideways and , just to be safe , keep fingering her vagina at the same time you slip it in . Now you know how to finger a woman ! You 're ready to finger a woman whenever she asks for it -- any time , any place . Just be sure she 's referring to the sex act of fingering and not `` finger play '' nursery rhymes or musical `` fingering . '' That would be an awkward misunderstanding .

City of Fort Collins . The Colorado Municipal League summarized the court ruling , saying `` gender-specific public nudity ordinance violates Equal Protection . '' Essentially , the ruling means that as long as men are allowed to be shirtless in public so are women . The Fort Collins City Council decided not to appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court and repealed its ordinance prohibiting the baring of female breasts . At Breckenridge Town Council 's work session Tuesday , Jan. 14 , members discussed the public indecency portion of the town code . `` Because Fort Collins did not appeal the decision of the Tenth Circuit to the United States Supreme Court , the Tenth Circuit decision is final , '' town attorney Tim Berry wrote in a memo to council . `` Because Colorado is within the 10th Circuit , the decision in the Ft. Collins case is now binding on the town of Breckenridge . '' The decision makes the section of the Breckenridge public indecency code that mentions female breasts unlawful , Berry said . He added that the other definitions of lewd and indecent display in the town code are gender-neutral and still can be enforced . Those include : `` Sexual intercourse , flagellation or any sexual acts which are prohibited by law '' `` The touching , caressing or fondling of the breast , buttocks , anus or genitals '' `` The displaying of the pubic hair , anus , vulva , or genitals '' `` The open display of urinary or excretory functions '' At the meeting , Berry added that a city in New Hampshire lost a similar case and asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review it . On Monday , Jan. 13 , the Supreme Court decided not to review the case . Council member Gary Gallagher asked Berry for the definition of a public space . Berry said all of the incidents in the court cases occurred outside and that he assumes the code update would mainly apply to outdoor public spaces . Council moved the ordinance amendment forward , and it passed on first reading in the council 's regular meeting . While the Fort Collins case decision affects other communities in the 10th Circuit , it appears no other towns in Summit County specifically mention female breasts in their codes . Frisco does n't address public indecency in its town code . Dillon 's town code does not specify women in the section on public indecency , using gender-neutral language . Silverthorne 's town code section on indecent exposure includes only a short sentence , which reads : `` It is unlawful for a person to knowingly expose his or her genitals to the view of any person under circumstances in which such conduct is likely to cause affront or alarm to the other person .

Japan 's south island is constantly spitting up evidence and rumblings of the tectonic fault line that runs beneath it . Home to one of the world 's most active volcanoes , the expansive Mount Aso , it 's a place where an earthquake tremor is mundane , steam curls from cracks in the pavement , and pipes are installed to release the pressure of an area quite literally heaving with hot springs . In the region 's prefectures of Kumamoto and Oita , known as Japan 's hot spring capitals , you ca n't sneeze without stumbling upon the natural springs in one form or another . In the small town of Yufuin , for example , locals enjoy a relaxing hot-spring foot spa at the local train station while they wait for their train . Instead of a barbeque in the local park , a public steamer can often be found in town squares , where ingredients are cooked in the volcanic steam released by the springs . Most importantly , the area pipes the volcanic water into their famous public bathhouses , known as ` onsens ' , where locals and tourists alike can enjoy a soak in the nutrient-rich springs . A combination of enjoying the famous spas with friends and family and eating the local cuisine produced in the nutrient-rich volcanic soil , whole towns are dedicated to onsen tourism and hotels advertise themselves based off the beauty and features of their on-site baths . Both indoor and open-air , the baths are truly transformative , the only catch is that you have to enjoy them in the buff . Onsen for the naked and afraid For many , the idea of stripping down and sharing a bath with a bunch of strangers does n't sound too ` relaxing ' , but it 's an essential part of the experience . There are even signs translated into English so people like me ca n't cry ignorance and try and stand out like a sore thumb in a pair of swimmers . In fact , when I departed for the trip I was battling some serious anxiety about the prospect , and though I overcame it there are a few key rules to follow to optimise enjoyment and minimise embarrassment . For the uninitiated , there is a structure to the soak , unlike anything I have come across . How not to embarrass yourself If you 're staying in a hotel they will provide a traditional yukata - robes you should wear from your room to the Onsen . Do not , I repeat , DO NOT , take the nudity too far and go sans underwear . In an attempt to convince myself , and everybody else , that I was not nervous about stripping down in front of strangers I thought I would just wear the robes and cut out the middleman . Turns out , everybody wears underwear under their yakuta and you 'll be looked upon with suspicion if you forego it . Once you remove your clothes in the dressing room , you 'll leave your belongings in a locker . From there , it 's just you and the towels . The bold will stride from the changeroom to the baths in their birthday suit , first-timers will try , and fail , and use the tiny provided towels to protect their modesty . Before entering the spa it is imperative to use the showers and stools to wash . I was practically hanging onto my pearls for dear life when I contemplated the prospect of sitting and washing , absolutely starkers , in front of a bunch of other ladies , but it 's probably the most important step . The idea behind the washing is that for the shared bath to remain hygienic , and the volcanic properties unaffected , people need to be clean , and that means no clothes , and pre-washed . Like many before me , I braved my fear and while that first shower was the most shivering , vulnerable state I believe I have ever found myself in , I came out the other side a borderline nudist , and firm onsen convert . It was a quick turnaround I know , but here 's the thing ; no phones are allowed in the baths for obvious reasons , so quite aside from the relaxing soak and enriching minerals , some time spent sitting and doing absolutely nothing was invigorating . I was horrified , thirty minutes into my first onsen , to realise that apart from sleeping , this was the longest time I had spent completely unstimulated , probably in years . In breaking news , no phone , no music , no podcast and sometimes no talking in an open air bath is really soothing , and when that bath is filled with water from volcanic hot springs , the experience is tenfold . If visiting Japan , particularly Kyushu , it 's a must-do . How to dip your toes in before you swim Most will stay in a ryokan , a traditional Japanese hotel , with an onsen on site , but even standard hotels include onsen in the region . If a night in a hotel seems excessive , or beyond your price range , there are also bathhouses that you can pay to enter . In my favourite town of Kurukowa in the Kumamoto region , around thirty baths both open-air and indoor can be accessed with a pass that allows its user to access up to three baths , and it only sets you back 300 Yen , or just shy of $ 3 . If you find yourself truly unable to embrace the nudity , a pricier Ryokan will sometimes come with private onsen in the room . Having struck up some of the best conversations I 've ever had with ladies in the spa , as my new , nude , shackle-free self , however , I highly recommend you brave the shared space for a real experience .

Undefeated welterweight Jaron `` Boots '' Ennis looked sensational on Friday while scoring a fourth-round stoppage of Bakhtiyar Eyubov . The next night , a raggedy performance by Jesse Hart in a super middleweight contest with Joe Smith Jr scraped away some of the city 's prestige as an incubator of great fistic talent . -LRB- Thirteen fighters identified with Philadelphia are in the International Boxing Hall of Fame ; bet you ca n't name seven . -RRB- On Saturday at Philadelphia 's Liacouras Center , WBA/IBF 154-pound world title-holder Julian `` J-Rock '' Williams -LRB- 27-1-1 , 1 NC , 16 KOs -RRB- seeks to right the ship , so to speak , when he opposes Jeison Rosario -LRB- 19-1-1 , 13 KOs -RRB- in the first defense of the titles he won from Jarrett Hurd last May in one of the most entertaining fights of 2019 . It 's a homecoming for Williams , 29 , who trains at the James Shuler Memorial Gym , named for the former middleweight contender who died at age 26 in a 1986 motorcycle accident . `` J-Rock '' last fought in Philly in 2011 at a small show at a National Guard armory when he was still a 6-round fighter . Williams , like so many professional boxers , had a rough upbringing . According to an article by Frank Fitzpatrick in the Philadelphia Inquirer , during his school days Williams lived in an old motel that had been converted into a homeless shelter . His mother battled substance abuse and his father was in prison . The shelter was located a long distance from his high school , Overbrook , in gritty West Philadelphia . Getting there required a trip on two buses sandwiched around a ride on the `` el '' train . The faculty at Overbrook High School , who work in a 95-year-old building , face all the challenges that are endemic to inner-city schools populated by students from economically disadvantaged homes . But the school is famous because of the achievements of certain alumni . The great NBA player Wilt Chamberlain went to Overbrook High , as did the actor Will Smith and Guion S. Bluford Jr , America 's first African-American astronaut . If `` J-Rock '' can keep winning , he may etch his name on that roster . Williams will go to post a big favorite over Rosario , a 24-year-old Miami-based fighter from the Dominican Republic . They have a common opponent in Nathaniel Gallimore who was out-pointed by Williams after previously saddling Rosario with his lone defeat -LRB- TKO by 6 -RRB- . Rosario got this coming assignment when Jarrett Hurd changed his mind , declining a rematch with Williams after initially activating his rematch clause . -LRB- Hurd has a stay-busy fight later this month on the undercard of the Danny Garcia vs. Ivan Redkach bout at Brooklyn 's Barclays Center . -RRB- Williams vs. Rosario will air on FOX and FOX Deportes as part of a triple-header . In the co-feature , 23-year-old Brooklyn super featherweight Chris Colbert -LRB- 13-0 , 5 KOs -RRB- is matched against Panamanian southpaw Jezzrel Corrales -LRB- 23-3 , 9 KOs -RRB- in a match billed for an interim WBA title . The flashy Colbert , reportedly 103-3 as an amateur , has a big upside if he can improve his punching power . As for Julian Williams , down the road he figures to meet up with Jermell Charlo who recently recaptured his WBC 154-pound title while avenging a controversial loss to Tony Harrison . Williams ' lone defeat was inflicted by Jermell 's twin brother Jermall Charlo who now competes a weight class up at 160 . If that fight materializes , `` J-Rock '' would be the second person to lock horns with both Charlo twins at the pro level following Austin Trout . That may be putting the cart before the horse , but Williams , who is a good interview because of his forthrightness , is supremely confident . `` I do n't think it 's a difficult fight for me , to be quite honest , '' he says . `` We 're not going to make -LRB- Rosario -RRB- out to be -LRB- Sugar -RRB- Ray Robinson . But he has the ambition to win , so you ca n't underestimate him . '' Considering the obstacles that `` J-Rock '' has already overcome , it would seemingly be foolish to bet against him . -- -- -- Philadelphia fighters in the International Boxing Hall of Fame listed in order of their year of induction : Joe Frazier -LRB- 1990 -RRB- , Tommy Loughran -LRB- 1991 -RRB- , Philadelphia Jack O'Brien -LRB- 1991 -RRB- , Joey Giardello -LRB- 1993 -RRB- , Harold Johnson -LRB- 1993 -RRB- , Bob Montgomery -LRB- 1995 -RRB- , Matthew Saad Muhammad -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , Lew Tendler -LRB- 1999 -RRB- , Battling Levinsky -LRB- 2000 -RRB- , Jeff Chandler -LRB- 2000 -RRB- , Benny Bass -LRB- 2002 -RRB- , Harry Lewis -LRB- 2008 -RRB- , Bernard Hopkins -LRB- 2020 -RRB- .

In addition to looking after his monthly magazine , Fleischer wrote many books . Most were small biographies of famous fighters but there were also instructional manuals for boys and young men interested in learning the science of pugilism . In fact , Fleischer 's first book was a training manual . First published in 1929 , `` Training for Boxers '' -LRB- with a foreword by Jack Dempsey -RRB- sold more than one million copies at $ 1 each according to Fleischer 's 1972 obit in the New York Times . Fleischer 's three `` how to '' books for aspiring boxers were heavy on the importance of leading a virtuous life outside the ring . Do n't masturbate , he commanded his readers . Masturbation , in Fleischer 's view , was the scourge of civilization . The same admonition against `` self-abuse '' was found in the Boy Scouts Handbook . British military officer Lord Robert Baden-Powell , credited with founding the world-wide Boy Scouts movement , also railed against this temptation . The son of a clergyman , Baden-Powell did n't invent the popular saying `` idle hands are the devil 's workshop , '' but , among other things , His Lordship believed that excessive masturbation led to idiocy . If that were true , that does n't bode well for Tyson Fury -LRB- insert your own joke here -RRB- . At Monday 's press conference in Los Angeles , Fury said that as part of his preparation for his rematch with Deontay Wilder , he would be masturbating seven times a day . `` I have to keep my testosterone pumping , '' said Fury by way of explanation . Fury 's impulsion flouts conventional wisdom . Old-time trainers believed that masturbation and sex in general were to be avoided in the days preceding a fight . Celibacy was useful for keeping a fighter focused on the task at hand and the retention of semen was thought to be useful for keeping a boxer on edge so that when the battle commenced , he had a reservoir of pent-up energy ready to be unleashed . It was written that Primo Carnera 's trainers tied a string around his penis when he went to bed at night to keep him from having a wet dream . Like so much that was written about the Ambling Alp , this was assuredly nonsense . However , fanciful yarns like this exposed the mindset of many old trainers whose philosophies , however quaint , were passed on to future generations of boxers and trainers including some who are active today . Muhammad Ali said that he stopped having sex six weeks before a fight . Freddie Roach has been quoted as saying that he exhorts his fighters to `` practice discipline '' for 10 days before a bout . This was never an issue with Manny Pacquiao who reportedly adhered to a higher standard , eschewing sex for 21 days . David Haye , who held world titles at cruiserweight and heavyweight before retiring in 2018 , remains active in the sport as a manager and promoter . When it comes to his views on getting ready for a fight , the `` Hayemaker '' is a throwback . I do n't ejaculate for six weeks before the fight . No sex , no masturbation , no nothing . It releases too much tension . It releases a lot of minerals and nutrients that your body needs , and it releases them cheaply . -- David Haye For the record , although the evidence is slim , Haye 's beliefs lack scientific support . In fact , a 1999 Italian study found that testosterone levels actually increase as sexual activity increases . That finding suggests , egads , that the Gypsy King may actually be on to something . However , the view from here is that whether Tyson Fury masturbates 70 times a day , if that were humanly possible , or masturbates not at all , it wo n't matter a bit if Deontay Wilder lands his Sunday punch flush on his jaw . He 's going down and the ghost of Nat Fleischer will then hover over the ring and bellow , `` I told you so , you big lug , now go home and be a good role model and from now on keep your hands away from that appendage in your quiet hours .

Perhaps Wilder 's meeting Pope Francis had an effect . Before a throng of media cameras , videographers , reporters and promotion representatives at the Novo Theater at LA Live , the giant heavyweights hyped their upcoming rematch on Feb. 22 like two old friends . After all , anything else would be uncivilized . Wilder -LRB- 42-0-1 , 41 KOs -RRB- will clash with Fury -LRB- 29-0-1 , 20 KOs -RRB- at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Feb. 22 . Their heavyweight world title fight will be shown on FOX pay-per-view and ESPN pay-per-view . Thirteen months ago the two undefeated heavyweights clashed 200 yards away at the Staples Center in L.A. where that city saw one of the best world championship fights ever held in the weight class . After 12 back and forth rounds including two knockdowns , the heavyweight world title fight ended in a split draw . But oh , what a fight . A lot has changed since that first encounter , Fury signed a promotional contract with Top Rank and former hostilities with Premier Boxing Champions and its affiliates have ceased between the two boxing entities . It 's time to make money and make fights . In the press conference the two basketball tall heavyweights stood side by side on the elevated stage reminding all that today 's prizefighters in the unlimited weight class are much taller than yesteryear . `` Today 's heavyweights are 6 ' 8 \u2033 , 6 ' 9 , '' said Sugar Hill Steward who now trains Fury . `` The heavyweight division is still the biggest and most powerful division in boxing . It always will be . Everyone wants to see the fighters throwing the big blows . Wilder is one of the hardest hitters in history and Tyson is one of the best boxers . '' Together they are part of a resurgence in the heavyweight division that became dormant for nearly 20 years after Lennox Lewis retired . `` We talk about boxing having a renaissance , but it 's really about the heavyweight division . That 's what is going to create that renaissance more than anything right now , '' said Todd duBoef , president of Top Rank . Just last month Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz battled in Saudi Arabia and generated more than a million views for their heavyweight clash . This heavyweight clash should be just as successful . Both heavyweights are confident but amiably optimistic that each will be the victor . `` Let 's make it a Marvin Hagler vs. Tommy Hearns type of fight . I 'll meet you in the middle of the ring on February 22 . Just watch out for the right hand , because you 're going to sleep in two rounds , '' said Fury in a reasonable tone . Wilder smiled at the notion . `` When you 're facing power there 's no way around it . You ca n't prepare for that . You just have to hope that when it lands , it does n't do that much damage , '' said Wilder . `` He does n't even know how he got on the ground or how he got up in the first fight . He 's been dealing with feeling ever since the end of the first fight . '' Tom Brown , president of TGB Promotions expects even more violence than the first . `` We have two superstars here . The best two heavyweights in the world , '' said Brown who promoted their first encounter in Los Angeles on Dec. 1 , 2018 . `` These are the best in boxing . There is nothing like a big heavyweight championship fight . We have the undefeated hardest punching , the most feared heavyweight in the world and I believe one of the all-time great heavyweights in Deontay Wilder . '' Todd duBoef adds that the pair of heavyweights elevate the division with their moxie . `` Tyson is so true , so gritty and he backs it up with everything he does . When you combine it with Deontay Wilder , you have two great personalities . This is really the beginning of the next super heavyweight run for the sport of boxing , '' said duBoef . Anything resembling Hagler-Hearns would be uncivilized .

If it did have one , it probably would have been last weekend when there was basically no relevant action happening anywhere in the world . But the second weekend of January was a return to boxing 's new normal . It 's an age of wonder , where big fights happen all over the place all the time and the rise of new technology keeps making the sport more accessible to mass audiences than ever before . Well , provided one is willing to do the legwork of finding how to watch the fights and pay the applicable subscription fees , of course . Nonetheless , here are the biggest HITS and MISSES from the first big boxing weekend of 2020 . HIT : Jaime Munguia 's Precocious Middleweight Debut At the tender age of 23 , Jaime Munguia is competing in a new division already after winning a world title at junior middleweight . Munguia is still very much a work in progress , but his future appears to be super bright . His 11th round stoppage against Gary `` Spike '' O'Sullivan on DAZN was exactly the type of fight he needed right now . O'Sullivan was tough and thoroughly tested Munguia 's resolve . But the Mexican wisely followed the direction of trainer Erik Morales and ended up scoring an important win in his new weight class . Look , Munguia needs time to grow and develop , and there 's no shame in that . He should n't rush into fights against upper-level middleweights just yet . But give the fighter a year or so , and then line the rest of the world up . Sure , Munguia might not ever be quite elite enough to beat the Canelo Alvarezes and Gennady Golovkins of the world , but he 'll darn sure create some fun fights on the way to finding that out . MISS : Jesse Hart Unnecessary and Unsuccessful Move to Light Heavyweight Jesse Hart had two cracks at Gilberto Ramirez as a super middleweight but could n't quite do enough in the judges ' eyes either time to earn a win . Hart , 30 , from Philadelphia , is a solid professional , but I 'm not sure what he was thinking when he decided to chase Ramirez up the ladder to the 175-pound ranks . Ramirez , 28 , from Mexico , is 40-0 , but it 's not as if he 's a huge a draw or something . He 's not Canelo . Regardless , Hart 's experience against Joe Smith Jr. on Saturday night on ESPN should tell the fighter all he needs to know about how he fits inside the light heavyweight division . He does n't . Smith knocked Hart down in the seventh round on the way to picking up the split decision win . But even Hart 's promoter Bob Arum admitted Smith 's victory was way more decisive than that . I enjoy watching Hart fight . At 168 , he 's for sure a contender . But if he ca n't beat the flawed Smith , he certainly does n't have any business at 175 . Why not just move back down to 168 where he looked like a better fighter ? HIT : Claressa Shields : History-Making Win and Tantalizing Future Claressa Shields won a lopsided decision Friday over Ivana Habazin to become unified 154-pound champion . Shields , 24 , from Flint , Mich. , won her first two world title fights at 168 , her next four at 160 and now two more at 154 . It 's quite the feat to do things in that order , and seeing Shields consistently improve just about every time she fights means she 's not nearly finished with doing even more . The self-proclaimed `` GWOAT '' might really be on her way to becoming that someday . What amazes me the most though is that she very seriously seems to want to fight MMA fighter Amanda Nunes next . Sure , Shields wants to box Nunes in her own version of Mayweather-McGregor , but Shields also says she wants to fight Nunes -LRB- who is considered the best female MMA fighter ever -RRB- under MMA rules . That 's courageous , admirable and a little bit crazy . I like it . MISS : Tyson Fury Calling Ben Davidson a ` Personal Trainer ' After Split During the ESPN telecast of Hart-Smith Jr , ESPN aired a pre-taped interview with Tyson Fury about why he ditched trainer Ben Davidson before the upcoming Deontay Wilder rematch . Basically , Fury said that he wanted Javan `` SugarHill '' Steward to come on as a co-trainer and Davidson did n't agree with sharing the role . There 's nothing wrong with that . Both Fury and Davidson have the right to choose what 's best for their careers . But it was troubling to see Fury refer to Davidson now as a `` personal trainer . '' It was Davidson , after all , who spent all that time with Fury inside the gym and out while Fury made his way back from the addiction and mental health issues that had shelved his career for three long years . Sometimes emotions get the best of people and they say things they should n't say . It really seems like Fury did that in this case after not getting Davidson to do exactly what he wanted him to do . HIT : The Tremendous Upside of Jaron `` Boots '' Ennis Jaron `` Boots '' Ennis is a joy to behold inside a boxing ring . In fact , I 'm not sure I 've seen a more compelling up-and-comer at 147 in recent boxing history than the 22-year-old welterweight from Philadelphia . Ennis appears to have everything a fighter needs to become a superstar , and I really would n't be surprised if that 's what ends up happening over the next few years . He 's fast . He 's powerful . He has long arms . Man , this guy can fight . On top of all that , Ennis appears to be a great finisher , as he was against tough puncher Bakhtiyar Eyubov in the co-main event of Shields-Habazin . That , over everything , will help endear him to fight fans , and it will also bring him a long line of offers from boxing 's current crop of kingmakers and their partners over at DAZN , ESPN , Fox and Showtime .

As Karl-Anthony Towns ' absence from the floor due to a knee injury and an illness continues on , the Wolves have had to turn to others in order to attempt to make up for his production offensively . Wednesday night against Indiana was a night like that . Five different players reached double-figures in scoring , but none of them reached a figure higher than 17 for the night . 2 . There are two ways to look at this . It 's an issue that be shown in either a positive or negative light , depending on the outlook du jour . 3 . If you want the negative outlook , scroll down , we 'll get to that in a minute . 4 . On the bright side , Jarrett Culver was the team 's leading scorer on Wednesday night with the 17-point mark . In each of his last nine games he 's now reached double-figures in scoring . There are still inconsistencies with his shot from the outside , but he 's been overall much better on the offensive end of the floor . 5 . `` He 's definitely been a bright spot through some of these tough endings for us , '' coach Ryan Saunders said on Wednesday night . `` His future is bright . The way he 's been getting his looks on the offensive end . I think he 's been aggressive getting to the basket . '' 6 . Part of the reason for this uptick has been the fact that Culver is getting to the rim at a more frequent rate than he was early in the season , as Saunders alluded to . In his first 30 games of his NBA career , Culver averaged just 4.03 shot attempts inside five feet from the rim per game . 7 . For someone that does n't shoot a high percentage anywhere other than at the rim , it was n't a number that was high enough in terms of attempts . Bombing away from deep was n't going to be the answer to his offensive struggles . 8 . The change in how often Culver gets to the rim has been pretty drastic , nearly doubling to 7.77 attempts within five feet of the rim over the last nine games . That included 11 of his 13 shots in Wednesday 's 17-point effort . 9 . That does n't mean that Culver is n't still a work in progress , even in that area . The frequency is nice , but his shooting percentage of 54.2 in that area can get much better . And part of that would be finishing with his left hand , which is something Culver seems reluctant to do . But for the time being it 's certainly a positive development . 10 . For the record , Culver did have a very nice finish with his left hand on Wednesday . But it 's still something that needs to become more of a consistent part of his game . 11 . Culver does a nice job of absorbing the contact and using his left hand here pic.twitter.com/63YZIos4KN -- Kyle Ratke -LRB- @Kyle_Ratke -RRB- January 16 , 2020 12 . If you 're scrolling down to look for the negative , this is where you stop . 13 . Andrew Wiggins has reverted back to being a frustrating cog in the not-so-well-oiled machine that the Wolves offense has become . Wednesday was the third consecutive game in which he struggled to make an impact on the offensive end of the floor . 14 . On Saturday night against Houston , Wiggins finished with 11 points on 3-of-13 shooting and mostly floated through the game , minding his own business and not bothering anybody . Monday night against Oklahoma City was no better , as he totaled 10 points on 4-of-12 shooting , again floating through the evening . 15 . Wednesday night , Wiggins showed up for the second quarter , going 4-of-5 and scoring nine points in total . In that quarter he played 6:09 of game time . It was his bright spot , and a reason the Wolves went into the half with the lead , 16 . In the other three quarters , Wiggins totaled one point in 26:09 of time on the court . His final stat line of 10 points on 4-of-13 shooting with three rebounds and three assists was yet another lackluster effort . 17 . `` We want him to be aggressive , we 'll continue to stress that , and we want everybody on this team to be aggressive , get in the paint , and try and create , '' Saunders said . 18 . Wiggins has been anything but aggressive as of late . Whether he 's been put in position to be successful is a different discussion for another time . But regardless of the situation , the same fire that seemed to be lit under Wiggins earlier this season seems to have been extinguished . 19 . `` Kind of get him going early , '' Robert Covington said when asked how to snap Wiggins out of this funk . `` He needs to see a couple baskets go in early and he gets that intensity going on both sides of the court . That 's what he was doing very well early on . But we just got to get back to that same intensity and we just got to get going from the very beginning . '' 20 . What Covington said makes sense in theory , but Wiggins ' strong second quarter before a rudderless second half says otherwise . 21 . This screams of the past with Wiggins . Wiggins , who left prior to the media entering the locker room on Wednesday , shows flashes , as he did earlier this year , and then disappears for long stretches , as he seems to be doing right now . Finding out the answer for this is the question that has eluded every coach and teammate Wiggins has ever had at the NBA level . 22 . In Wiggins ' last six games played , dating back to Dec. 26 , he 's averaging 15.3 points per game on 35.2 % shooting and 24.3 % shooting from deep . This serious dip in production is a reason why the Wolves offense has n't been as good as it could be . 23 . Essentially , in the time spans mentioned for each player , Jarrett Culver has been a better basketball player than Andrew Wiggins . And as mentioned before , that can be good or bad depending on your choice of outlooks . 24 . The Wolves play the Indiana Pacers again on Friday night before taking on the Toronto Raptors Saturday at Target Center . Talk to you this weekend .", "url": "https://www.skornorth.com/wolves-2/2020/01/last-shots-there-are-positives-and-negatives-to-look-at-its-all-about-the-outlook/", "kws": ["outlook", "game", "outlooks", "flashes", "Pacers", "inconsistencies", "double-figures", "attempts", "Indiana^^Pacers", "Wolves", "progress", "thoughts", "Karl-Anthony^^Towns", "Twenty-four^^quick^^thoughts", "Minnesota", "Toronto^^Raptors", "3-of-13^^shooting", "coach^^Ryan^^Saunders", "NBA", "4-of-5"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000096559524536}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Basketball": 1.0000096559524536}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Basketball_NBA": 1.0}}}

Nizer will perform at the Honeywell Center on Jan. 23 . Nizer learned to juggle when he was a young child . His mom thought it would be an outlet for her kids ' excess energy , and it ended up sticking for Nizer . `` It worked out pretty well for me , '' Nizer said in a recent phone interview with Whatzup . `` I ended up really loving it and the feeling and adrenaline rush of learning something new , along with the brain challenge of it all . '' After extensive practice , Nizer started competing and street performing . The street performances helped him understand comedy better . `` Getting a laugh is as great a rush as learning some impossible juggling trick , '' Nizer said . Always Be Marketing Mentors played a large part in the growth of Nizer 's juggling career . His mentors over the years included Bob Hope and George Burns who taught him how to write his own material and find his own voice , along with marketing himself and his act . Nizer said the job requires relentless marketing . `` They put me in places where I got a lot of good exposure , which really helped me expand where I could work , '' Nizer said . `` Then , it sort of snowballed . I started doing stand-up comedy in New York City , and each little piece helped raise the show up a little more . '' Nizer works daily to better himself and his act . Every day he writes new material and practices his juggling skills . `` I try to keep my brain going and challenge myself , '' Nizer said . `` Juggling wise , I usually practice about two hours a day for a couple reasons . One , to maintain my skill , but two , to learn new things , even though I may never use them in the show . '' Each show , he tries to incorporate at least one new joke . Fans approached Nizer following a gig one night and expressed they did not realize he was a stand-up comedian as well . For him , this was a great compliment . `` It 's there to support the show , but it really is becoming what the show really is -- laughing , '' Nizer said . `` Look what I can do and you ca n't only takes you so far . '' He still enjoys the learning and the creativity that juggling has always allowed him to explore . `` I still have the feeling of that 12-year-old boy that learned to juggle in my 58-year-old frame , '' Nizer said . `` It 's nice I 'm not burned out yet . '' Technical and interactive Technology and the internet have helped in expanding what 's possible for juggling . A routine that includes a simple juggling act can now include laser manipulation , lights triggered by movements of the objects , cell phones firing with them , and fog machines . `` All of these little pieces of the dance come together to make it more of a visual eye candy , '' Nizer said . On this tour , Nizer has introduced a cell phone takeover . He encourages everyone to bring their cell phones , as they are important lighting instruments . `` The whole theater becomes part of the show , '' Nizer said . `` I really think it 's neat that it encompasses the entire venue . '' While he used to be focused on pushing highly technical juggling routines where he felt no one knew what was going on , Nizer said it 's no longer about that for him . He enjoys tricks that are interactive with the audience . `` It 's about when a great audience is there and we 're having this amazing connection and the jokes are working , '' Nizer said . `` It just becomes a really beautiful live performance moment . That 's what I live for now . That is the payoff . '' Juggling still the focus Juggling remains the basis of his acts , though . One of Nizer 's favorite juggling tricks is called the impossible trick , although he thinks it 's fairly simple . `` The impossible trick is where I kick a ball off my back heel and it comes over my head and lands on top of a ball spinning on my right finger , and then they both spin together , '' Nizer said . `` That 's a great trick to pull off . '' Fitness is also a foundational element of his routines . Nizer said one of his biggest challenges has been keeping his body in shape . In order to keep in shape , Nizer has turned to his wife 's yoga teachings . He said the stretching has changed his life , and he 's now in the best shape he 's ever been in , but it was a big change . `` I take a class with 90-year-old women who kick my butt , '' Nizer said . `` I really encourage men to get out there and start stretching . '' There is no stopping Nizer -- he said he will keep performing until the day he drops dead . His performances might change , however . `` We 're going to keep performing , but maybe go to places that are less fortunate and try to teach some , '' Nizer said . `` I certainly want to keep exploring and try to help other people play with their toys . I think everybody needs to put the phone down and go outside and explore gravity a little more .

Mom meets with gay son to share her opinions . Gay son calls cops . Cops show up and take Mom 's side . take our poll - story continues below It seems like not all is well in Chula Vista , CA as citizens stand against Drag Queen Story Hour while their representatives continue to push it . Here 's more from Mass Resistance : For months , parents and citizens in Chula Vista , CA , a suburb of San Diego , have insisted that their City Council take action to stop any more `` Drag Queen Story Hour '' events from targeting children in the public library . On September 10 , 2019 , the Chula Vista library held a particularly hideous and perverted `` Drag Queen Story Hour '' event . Since then a large number of parents have testified at City Council meetings and have leafletted the town . They want the City Council to keep these kinds of things from happening in the public library . But the 5-member Council arrogantly refuses to even bring it up for discussion . Instead , City Councilor Stephen Padilla , an out `` gay , '' has waged a campaign against the parents . He has insulted them during Council meetings . He calls them haters and religious fanatics . He even led a repulsive anti-Christian `` counter-protest '' against parents who protested outside the library . -LRB- Interestingly , Padilla used to be married to a woman and they have a child , according to local residents . -RRB- Padilla 's hate knows no bounds . He called our San Diego MassResistance chapter a `` white supremacist '' group -- even though two-thirds of the members are non-white and the leader is Filipino ! . ... Surprisingly , this past week Stephen Padilla , who had refused to meet with anyone , agreed to meet with Lorena in his City Hall office . She came , and calmly told him the truth about the Drag Queen Story event . His behavior toward her was disgraceful . He ultimately threw her out of his office and tried to have her removed from City Hall . Lorena 's experience is a view into why Drag Queen events and so many other horrible programs are allowed in our schools and libraries . It is a window into the anger and irrational thinking of many public officials on the LGBT issue , and `` progressivism '' in general . And it demonstrates that we must never be afraid to tell the truth -- because the truth is what will really jar these people . Here 's what Lorena told us : I came into his office . Councilman Padilla was there with his assistant Tony . I started out our meeting by telling Councilman Padilla : `` I am here to ask you : Why do you support Drag Queen Story Hour ? Why did you side with the LGBT protesters ? And why were you so aggressive towards the people who do n't support it ? '' He refused to answer that question . Instead , he brought up the lie that MassResistance is a `` hate group . '' He started to lecture me , treating me like I was ignorant . He asked me , `` Have you heard of the Department of Justice ? Have you heard of the Southern Poverty Law Center ? '' What kind of question is that ?! I answered , `` Yes I have heard of those groups . You know that they -LRB- the Southern Poverty Law Center -RRB- call Christian groups `` hate groups '' because they oppose the LGBT Agenda . '' But Steve Padilla fired back , `` That 's not true . '' He tried to argue that they are a civil rights group . I countered : `` No , it is true . I saw it on their own website ! '' Anyone can see that they 're the ones who are a hate group . You Might Like I kept trying to get back to the point , about the Drag Queen Story Hour . I told him about the Drag Queens who were in the Chula Vista library , who call themselves , Raquelita and Barbie-Q . They also sang these awful , disgusting songs on YouTube . But our public officials say they 're role models . `` They are not role models ! '' I told him . Steve Padilla told me , `` I have not seen those videos . '' I told him to watch those videos , and that he would see that these two men are not good to be around children . I told him , `` Kids can go on the Internet . They can look up the Drag Queens they saw at our library , and they will find those videos . Do you think those videos are good for kids to see ? '' -LSB- NOTE : You can see those videos here and here . -RSB- Padilla tried to blow me off : `` The kids did n't see the videos in their performance in the library . They did n't do anything wrong . '' I fired back : `` You are just closing your eyes ! You do n't want to see . This is not OK for kids . Drag Queen Story Hour is still wrong ! '' So then he went into talking about `` freedom of speech , '' and he claimed that lots of people liked the Drag Queen Story Hour . He also told me that lots of people in the city supported it , and that he has to listen to all his constituents . He then said that 300 people attended the Drag Queen Story Hour . ... Then Padilla said , `` Just because you have religious objections , it does n't mean we have to stop the program . '' He claimed that it was the minority of religious people in the city who did n't like the program . I then asked him : `` Why were you siding with people who had those disgusting anti-Christian signs ? Why did you side with them ? '' Is this the love and tolerance that you want to bring to Chula Vista ? Or is it intolerance to people like me that want to speak the truth ? Padilla continued to justify himself with the freedom of speech argument : `` They have freedom of speech . '' `` But you were happy to side with them ! '' Padilla tried to deny it , but I told him , `` I saw you addressing the crowd , very happy , and leading the crowd around the library before going into the parking lot . You were very happy , very excited . You took sides with them . Why ? '' ... I insisted that the city pass an ordinance to make sure that Drag Queen Story Hour never comes back , but he arrogantly declared , `` That will never happen ! '' `` So , you are going to have future drag queen story hours ? '' `` Maybe , '' Padilla said . Over and over , he tried to tell me that Drag Queen Story Hour was accepted everywhere except Chula Vista . That is simply a lie , but he would not allow me to correct him . In fact this program has created much controversy and met with lots of protests in other parts of the country . Then I told him this : `` Let 's finish with this . Drag Queen Story Hour is a step towards legalizing pedophilia , and you are part of it ! '' At this point , Councilman Padilla stood up , got really angry , with a disgusted face . `` What are you saying ? You are going too far . Let me educate you ... '' But I did n't stop there . `` Since the 1970s , there 've been organizations like NAMBLA ... '' and I told him about the Ted Talks on YouTube , and there classes at San Diego State University which talk about pedophilia as another sexual orientation . Padilla got really upset with me . He even told me that I needed mental help ! He did n't want to listen . I did n't care . `` One more thing , '' I said . `` In 100 years , it wo n't matter what your political gains are . You will be standing before God ... '' but by then , he stormed out of his office . ... I asked , `` What if I do n't leave ? '' They threatened to call the police , but I stood my ground and asked them : `` And what are they going to do ? Take me to jail ? '' Francisco answered : `` They will escort you out . '' To be honest with you , this was scary for me ! I had a right to be in City Hall . I said to them , `` This is the government we have ? This is tyranny ! '' Finally , I agreed to leave . But before I left I stopped to speak with Councilman Mike Diaz , who was in his City Hall office . The police did eventually arrive . At first , they asked Councilman Diaz : `` Is there anyone in your office that you want to remove ? '' I told them that they were there because of me , because of Councilman Padilla calling them to remove me . I told the police the simple truth , why Padilla had called them to have me removed : `` The fact is that Steve Padilla did not like what I said to him ! '' And I told the police specifically what Padilla did n't like , which is that I mentioned the connection between Drag Queen Story Hour and pedophilia . By that point , the police were clearly on my side . They understand that it was not right for Councilman Padilla to call the police on me just because I said something that he did not like . And they left without bothering me . Now this is how you confront elected officials ! Notice that Lorena did not back down from her clear objections to the Drag Queen Story Hour program . ... Read it all at Mass Resistance ... ##### So the police showed up and decided that no crime had been committed . What a flake ! This is his mother . Make no mistake America . If it is n't already there , Drag Queen Story Hour is headed for your library too . CHILD ABUSE : Dallas Parents Mobilize To Protest `` Drag Queen '' Reading To Small Children `` What Color Is Your Underwear ? '' Not that there is anything wrong with Drag Queens flashing their sexuality to a bunch of prepubescent children . National Review 's David French : Drag Queen Story Hour is ` One of the Blessings of Liberty ' It 's so trendy that even a columnist at National Review supports it .

Share your thoughts in comments , and even post your own links to interesting , safe-for-work , sports stories . So let 's go ! Come on in ! DUKES TOP RAMS IN OT Wednesday , 1/15 : Duquesne escaped with an overtime victory over Fordam Wednesday night , 58-56 , at PPG Paints Arena . The Dukes got one clutch free throw each from center Baylee Steele and guard Sincere Carry in the closing moments of OT for the winning margin . Guard Lamar Norman Jr. had a big night for the Dukes , scoring 20 points , while forward Michael Weathers pulled down 10 rebounds to go with eight points as they led Duquesne -LRB- 15-2 , 5-0 -RRB- past a game Fordham -LRB- 6-10 , 0-4 -RRB- . The Rams held the Duke to just 37 percent shooting from the floor , but Duquesne once again played a disciplined game , keeping Fordham to just five free throws in the game . The Rams ' backcourt led the way in scoring as guard Ty Perry had 17 points and 6 rebounds , while guard Jalen Cobb added 16 points . Forward Onyi Eyisi had 14 rebounds and nine points . The Dukes have a week to catch their breath from this one but have tough test next , traveling to play Rhode Island -LRB- 11-5 , 3-1 -RRB- on Wednesday , Jan. 22 , at 7 p.m. -- Bob OBJ LSU 'S ATM ? Wednesday , 1/15 : Browns receiver and LSU alum Odell Beckham Jr. may have given LSU players cash following their victory over Clemson in the national championship game Monday night . Pictures clearly show OBJ handing out some form of currency to players from a large wad . Initially , it was claimed that he was handing out fake currency , but after LSU quarterback Joe Burrow and others stated that Beckham Jr. was handing out real cash , an investigation has ensued and LSU has issued a statement : Statement from #LSU on Odell-cash gate pic.twitter.com/dLWGy1BDyk -- Ross Dellenger -LRB- @RossDellenger -RRB- January 15 , 2020 To clarify , any cash given to seniors is not a violation as their student-athlete status expired with the game 's final whistle , but any money given to an underclassman , or given from a senior to an underclassman , is a clear violation of existing NCAA regulations . Just another day for OBJ . -- Bob GALLANT ROLLS SNAKE EYES Wednesday , 1/15 : The Golden Knights fired head coach Gerard Gallant on Wednesday along with assistant coach Mike Kelly . Vegas is currently 24-19-6 and tied in points for the last wildcard spot in the Western Conference . Peter DeBoer was announced as Gallant 's replacement . Gallant , the only coach in the franchise 's three year history , won the Jack Adams Award as the league 's top coach in 2017-18 as he took the Golden Knights to the Stanley Cup finals in their inaugural season -- the first expansion team to ever accomplish that feat -- losing to the Capitals in five games . He followed that up with a third-place division finish in 2018-19 , but Vegas was eliminated in the first round by the Sharks in seven games . Gallant finishes his time in Vegas with a 118-75-20 record . If there is a prime example of how NHL head coaching is the most `` what have you done for me lately '' business , it 's this one . -- Bob FITZ STAYS IN THE DESERT Wednesday , 1/15 : Cardinals receiver Larry Fitzgerald agreed to a one-year contract on Wednesday to play a 17th season in Arizona . Financial terms were not disclosed . Fitzgerald had 75 catches for 804 yards and four touchdowns in 2019 , Kyler Murray 's first season as quarterback . There was speculation that Fitzgerald would retire after the 2019 season , but it appears he 's going to move forward with one-year agreements until he 's ready to make that decision . Fitzgerald is the NFL 's No. 2 all-time leader in catches -LRB- 1,378 -RRB- and yards -LRB- 17,083 -RRB- , trailing only the legendary Jerry Rice in each category , and he is sixth all-time in receiving touchdowns -LRB- 120 -RRB- . His 17,083 receiving yards are the most for any player with one team . It 's always good to see No. 11 on Sundays . -- Bob KUECHLY 'S RETIREMENT SHOCKS Tuesday , 1/14 : Panthers middle linebacker Luke Kuechly stunned fans Tuesday as he announced his retirement after eight seasons in the NFL . A deeply emotional Kuechly , through the team , took to Twitter to explain his decision : `` In my heart , I know it 's the right thing to do . '' pic.twitter.com/mSDyJ0iEMw -- Carolina Panthers -LRB- @Panthers -RRB- January 15 , 2020 Kuechly , 28 , was voted to seven Pro Bowls in his eight seasons , all with Carolina , was first-team All-Pro five times , and was the NFL Rookie of the Year in 2012 and the NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2013 . He finishes his career with 1092 tackles -LRB- 690 solo -RRB- in 118 games , 18 interceptions and 12.5 sacks . Kuechly is the second elite player to elect for early retirement in 2019-20 , following Colts QB Andrew Luck 's announcement prior to the season . One ca n't fully know his reasons , but I 'd expect more of these as players realize the long-term effects on the body might outweigh the monetary benefits . -- Bob BRADY NEW OC IN CAROLINA Tuesday , 1/14 : LSU passing game coordinator Joe Brady has left the Tigers for the NFL , becoming the Panthers ' offensive coordinator for new head coach Matt Rhule . Brady does n't really have much left to accomplish at the college level after , ya know , producing a passing offense that led the nation in yards and touchdowns -- 60 , an FBS record -- and made Joe Burrow a Heisman winner and likely No. 1 pick in the upcoming NFL draft . It 's fair to say his stock ca n't get any higher . Let 's see if he can work that same magic for Cam Newton -- assuming he can return healthy -- and help offset the stunning loss of linebacker Luke Kuechly to retirement . -- Bob FORMER PLAYER SUES FRANKLIN Tuesday , 1/14 : Former Penn State safety Isaiah Humphries has sued PSU head coach James Franklin and former teammate Damion Barber as defendants in federal court , claiming Franklin and his staff ignored violent and vile hazing of a sexual nature in the program , then forced him out of the program for reporting it . Humphries named former teammates Micah Parsons , Yetur Gross-Matos , and Jesse Lekuta as players leading the abuse . The initial complaint to the program was filed by Humphries ' father , Leonard Humphries , a former defensive back at Penn State , after his son informed him of the alleged abuses . Hunter Homistek has our site 's full coverage of these allegations here . -- Bob DONALDSON SIGNS WITH TWINS Tuesday , 1/14 : Mark Feinsand is reporting that Josh Donaldson has reached a four-year contract agreement with the Twins . Anonymous sources for AP indicate the deal is for $ 92 million with a fifth-year club option for $ 8 million . Donaldson , 34 , was one of the premier power hitters left in free agency . Last season he slashed .259 / .379 / .521 -LRB- .900 OPS -RRB- for the Braves , with 37 home runs and 94 RBIs . He was the American League MVP in 2015 , and his return the the AL will allow him to DH as he ages or needs days off from third base . -- Bob PATRICK , JOHNSTON LAUNCH 3ICE Tuesday , 1/14 : Former Penguins GM Craig Patrick and E.J. Johnston , the son of former Penguins GM Ed Johnston , have sold the television rights to CBS Sports for 3ICE , a new 3-on-3 pro hockey league scheduled to start play in June 2021 . -LRB- Thanks to commenter `` alantig '' for the link . -RRB- The league , which is not affiliated with the NHL , will initially have eight teams with seven members each and one head coach . They will also have penalty shots for all called penalties . Sounds like a good idea , but if it ends up being played like the current 3-on-3 NHL overtime , I 'll lose interest in a hurry . Will you be checking it out ? Any rules you 'd like to see to keep it fresh and fast ? -- Bob NEW CBA BOOSTS WNBA PLAYERS Tuesday , 1/14 : The WNBA Players Union reached a tentative agreement on a new CBA with the league that increases the salary cap by 30 percent and nearly doubles the salary for the top players . There are also improved travel benefits and full pay while on maternity leave . This is long overdue for an established , successful league . -- Bob JOHNSON TRYING OUT AS KICKER Tuesday , 1/14 : Former NFL wide receiver Chad `` Ochocinco '' Johnson is trying out for the XFL ... as a kicker . The 42-year-old posted his decision on Twitter on Tuesday , including a video of him making a 60-yard attempt . He must tryout for the XFL in Houston next Monday . Johnson did kick for the Bengals in one preseason game , making an extra point and executing the ensuing kickoff . I 'd say his chances are 1 in 85 . -- Bob BURROW BURIES CLEMSON Tuesday , 1/14 : Louisiana State University quarterback Joe Burrow threw for five touchdowns and ran for another as No. 1 LSU dominated No. 3 Clemson in the second half of the FBS National Championship Game at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans to win the national championship , 42-25 . With the win , LSU completed their first undefeated season since 1959 . Clemson -LRB- 14-1 -RRB- had an early 17-7 lead , but LSU -LRB- 15-0 -RRB- just had too much offense , compiling 628 total yards behind Burrow 's 463 yards on 31 of 49 passing , and an additional 58 yards rushing on 14 carries . With eight touchdowns passes against Oklahoma in the semifinal , Burrow alone accounted for 14 touchdowns in the College Football Playoff . He now finishes the season with 60 touchdown passes against just six interceptions , and five rushing touchdowns . Clemson sophomore quarterback Trevor Lawrence suffered his first loss as a starter for the Tigers in 30 starts , completing 18 of 37 passes for 234 yards an one rushing touchdown . Steelers fans are set to see Burrow for at least the next five seasons -- barring some colossal screw-up , the Bengals are sure to select the 2019 Heisman winner and Athens , Ohio native with the first pick in the 2020 NFL Draft . Steelers ILB Vince Williams is kinda looking forward to it : Gon na be cool sacking Joe next year -- Vince Williams -LRB- @VinnyVidiVici98 -RRB- January 14 , 2020 Did Burrow have the best ever offensive college football season ? -- Bob GATES HANGS 'EM UP Tuesday , 1/14 : Chargers tight end Antonio Gates called it a career : Breaking : After 16 seasons with the Chargers , Antonio Gates announced his retirement from the NFL . pic.twitter.com/vZK8GBRdRB -- SportsCenter -LRB- @SportsCenter -RRB- January 14 , 2020 Truthfully , I thought Gates retired last offseason -- but do n't let his relatively quiet exit diminish his career numbers . He 's one of the best tight ends to ever do it , catching 955 passes for 11,841 yards and 116 touchdowns in his 16-year career , all spent with the Chargers . For some perspective , those 11,841 yards rank 29th all-time , ahead of names such as Calvin Johnson , Antonio Brown , Keyshawn Johnson , Chad Johnson and Rod Smith , just to name a few . The touchdowns are even more impressive , ranking seventh all-time and first among tight ends , surpassing Tony Gonzalez 's 111 . Only Jerry Rice , Randy Moss , Terrell Owens , Chris Carter , Marvin Harrison and Larry Fitzgerald have caught more passes in the end zone . Not bad . Oh , and a fun fact : Gates played basketball in college . Who knew ? -- Hunter MARCHAND 'S HISTORIC WHIFF Monday , 1/13 : It could n't have happened to a nicer guy . Bruins forward Brad Marchand needed to score to keep the Bruins alive in the shootout against the Flyers . After starting deep in his own zone to attack the puck at center red with speed , Marchand did this : Pure filth from Brad Marchand pic.twitter.com/UoT2bzdRyl -- NBC Sports Philadelphia -LRB- @NBCSPhilly -RRB- January 14 , 2020 The on-ice officials conferred and determined that Marchand made an attempt and therefore it was a `` no goal , '' giving the Flyers the win , 6-5 , under the most unusual circumstance . It also gave the Flyers a few laughs : The Flyers , leaving the ice , ca n't keep from laughing at Brad Marchand abandoning the puck at center red on the shootout . Alain Vigneault : ` Have n't seen that before . ' Unidentified player : ` Maybe his nose got in the way . ' That 's unkind.pic.twitter.com/O9ooSeDPca -- Dejan Kovacevic -LRB- @Dejan_Kovacevic -RRB- January 14 , 2020 It was a fitting end for the Bruins , who coughed up a 5-2 lead with just six minutes and change left in the second period . Dry your eyes . -- Bob FREESE 'S COLD SHOULDER Monday , 1/13 : Former Pirates third baseman David Freese offered a blunt opinion on MLB 's punishment of the Astros over sign stealing and , safe to say , he 's no fan of what went down in Houston ... and thinks it could have gone further : Did n't really expect the punishments to be this harsh . Good for MLB stepping up . Still do n't know what 's more frustrating tho , an ex teammate of the WS title team talking publicly about his team cheating or so many guys being down to use a damn trash can lol . Should take the ring -- David Freese -LRB- @david23freese -RRB- January 13 , 2020 Freese played for the Dodgers during the 2018 World Series against the Red Sox , who were managed by Alex Cora -- an integral part of the sign-stealing scheme in Houston -- as the Red Sox won the championship . Boston is currently under investigation by MLB for sign-stealing and Cora is reported to have a harsh punishment coming from the league for his primary role in the Astros ' cheating . Alex Stumpf has the site 's full coverage on the Astros ' punishment here . Sports Illustrated accumulated several other player reactions . Do you agree with Freese : Should the Astros lose the title ? -- Bob BROWN BAD AGAIN Monday , 1/13 : In honor of the Jeopardy! Greatest of All Time Tournament , I 'll give you the answer and see if you can give me the question .

She loved her family , her church , and the world that she attempted to change . Always looking for the good in everyone , she occasionally was stubborn beyond belief . We have a vision of her spending time in heaven , connecting , chatting , sharing and celebrating life in all its beauty . Barbara L. Newhall , 98 , died quickly and peacefully Sunday afternoon , Jan. 12 , 2020 . She was born on March 20 , 1921 , in Brockton , Mass. , to her parents Gertrude and Frank Moore . One of five siblings , she grew up in a poor but exceedingly happy home , filled with love , adventure and laughter . Barbara began her lifelong love of the church at Pearl Street United Methodist Church across the street from her home , where she attended church , sang in the choir , played the piano and frolicked on the tennis courts and in the blueberry fields . She was the first conference president of Methodist Youth Fellowship for the New England Conference , and met her beloved Richard there . He fell instantly in love with the beautiful blonde girl , but could wangle an introduction only by throwing her repeatedly off the diving float ! Per her mother 's rules , she still went home with the boy who had brought her . A graduate of Brockton High School in 1938 , she was in the top five of her class , active in many sports , and played on undefeated basketball teams all four years . She always was the first person to foul out for unnecessary roughness ! After receiving a full scholarship , Barbara attended Bridgewater State Teachers ' College , and completed her time there with her permanent teaching certificate . She lettered in seven sports and was the secretary for the Music Department . Barbara 's romance with Richard began in high school and lasted ... each became the first person from their family to attend college . While Richard came out to Illinois to school , they courted by mail . They decided to get married at the end of summer 1942 via short 3-minute phone call while Richard was attending the Breadloaf School of English . Three weeks later , having found a teaching job , they were married at the end of Sunday morning worship in her home church . Their best man was Jewish and the maid of honor was Roman Catholic , showing an early movement to ecumenism . A bus trip to their new home in Illinois , with seats at different ends of the bus , followed . Barbara taught in a one-room school . Together , they served churches at Rural , Hettick , Riverton , McDowell , Center , Springfield First , Delavan , Moline Bethel , Macomb Wesley , Danville St. James , Bloomington Wesley and Dwight . Along the way , they added five children to their family : Alan , Janet , John , Kathryn and Paul . They also welcomed many people into their home , sharing Christian hospitality and great food . John was a child who required lots of love and assistance to thrive . Barbara was active in United Methodist Women , PTA , Great Books , and P.E.O. . As a choir director and organist , she led in many different music programs . They retired to Cedar Rapids , Iowa , in 1982 , and leapt into life in the community . She retired in August 2019 , from 36 years as one of the chapel organists at St. Paul 's United Methodist Church ; she sang in the choir , played bells , chaired Thrift Mart and was extremely active in UMW . Barbara possessed an uncanny ability to get people involved in various activities . An avid Scrabble player , her children and grandchildren all learned to play competitively from her . She was extremely proud that three of their children entered the ministry . Following Richard 's death in November 2003 , she adjusted to life shared with her daughter , Kathryn , and Newbie the cat . Barbara is survived by her children , Alan Newhall , Janet Spoerl , Kathryn A. Newhall and Paul Newhall . She considered all the spouses part of her family : Kathryn I. Newhall , Ron Spoerl and Teresa Newhall . She dearly loved all her grandchildren , Alan Jr. / Lori Newhall , Adam/Karin Newhall and Abigail Newhall ; Scott -LRB- deceased -RRB- / Julie Spoerl , Benjamin/Laura Spoerl ; Jonathan/Evan GrauHall , Andrew/Adrienne Newhall and Rebecca/John Warner ; and great-grandchildren , Madi , Lexi , Paige , JJ , Julianna , Desi , Ezra , Katelyn , Brooke , Alex , Nicholas , Thomas , Sophia , Miles , Jack and Calvin . She is survived by her siblings , Priscilla Mueller , Robert Moore and Frank/Rosemary Moore ; as well as a host of cousins . Her brother , Douglas , and her son , John , predeceased her . Barbara 's family was expansive and not limited by genetics , especially her adopted daughter , Marie/David Glasgow . So many people called her `` Mom '' or `` Mother . '' Many special friends made her final years a joy . Please join us in giving Barbara a holy and harmonious send-off at her visitation from 4 to 7 p.m. Thursday , Jan. 16 , at Cedar Memorial .

Just like it has for most of the season , the team went through the same exact routine of meetings and practice on Wednesday . The mood in the open locker room was as lively as ever , showing no change from the weeks prior . Music was playing . Emmanuel Sanders was shooting baskets at the hoop over his locker . Players were joking around with each other and Kendrick Bourne was going through his daily routine of customizing his practice gear . On the field , the usual suspects were dancing as calisthenics started . Players went through the same warm-ups and stretching order as they 've had since OTAs . The younger players kept the atmosphere upbeat while the veterans brought out an underlying calm . `` Definitely , you feel it in there , '' Garoppolo said . `` It 's definitely a loose atmosphere , but that 's kind of how it 's been all year . Guys are loose , but they are locked in at the same time . It 's a unique combination . We have the guys that are able to do it . '' Coach Kyle Shanahan believes the challenge posed by the second half of the 49ers ' regular-season schedule mentally prepared his team for the playoffs . He has kept the players ' schedules as similar to the regular season as possible . `` Our players have handled it pretty good all year , '' Shanahan said . `` I know by this background and these helmets next to me there 's a lot more dog and pony show and stuff , but hopefully our players know it 's just Wednesday like it 's been all year and tomorrow will be Thursday . '' Sanders , who has quite a bit of experience in the postseason , noted that he does n't feel any added pressure or stress . `` I do n't feel it ramping up , '' Sanders described . `` It 's crazy . Does n't even -- it just feels like another regular-season game . Like I said , I feel like even in the regular season it was like playoff football . It was so much pressure and us having to perform and trying to get the No. 1 seed that you just kind of get used to it , right ? Every week has been a big week . '' Garoppolo , as usual , shared a few laughs at the podium before getting down to brass tacks when answering questions . He remained unflappable , never showing any signs of nerves or stress . `` It 's no different than any other week , '' Garoppolo said . `` We 're coming out here Wednesday , ready to roll and preparing our ass off . I think guys are locked into the preparation with the game plan going in today . Guys are locked in , they are focused up and we are in a good spot right now .

So what happens to somebody who , in this case , works at a strip club and gets assaulted in the club walks into the local police precinct and says , ` This happened to me . ' Especially if it 's a local precinct , where half the guys , when they 're off duty , hang out at the strip club . How seriously are they going to take a stripper 's complaint ? '' With the case stalled , `` by the time our guys hear of the assault , the survivor 's completely alienated -- she has no faith in law enforcement at all , '' Leight says . `` -LSB- She -RSB- is basically going vigilante . We already gave Benson sort of tough nut to crack with the Ariel Winter episode , a character who was complicated and self-sabotaging . This woman is , in some ways , much more hardened than that character was and does n't trust our guys at all . So that 's I think the crux of that episode : How do you bond with somebody who does n't trust you in any way ? '' The episode also marks series star Mariska Hargitay 's seventh time behind the camera directing . `` She 's all in , '' Leight gushes . `` She 's very visual . She 's very committed , and you do n't have to explain all the rules of the show . -LSB- When she 's behind the camera -RSB- we can just talk story and visual approach .

Here 's what you need to know before you talk to your children about periods - which you should do by the time they 're 8 , experts tell Rosie Murray-West `` I bet Greta Thunberg does n't flush her tampons into the sea '' . Sometimes parenting a young eco-warrior can throw up some interesting discussions . My 12-year-old can spot a piece of single-use plastic at 50 paces , is considering veganism and attends Friday climate strikes . But how would her dedication to Planet Earth play out when it came to her first period ? Statistics show that the next generation of young women are ready to put their parents ' money where their principles are when it comes to menstruation , with reusable period pants and other eco solutions becoming more popular . `` Today 's consumer is becoming more aware and concerned with environmental and sustainability issues , so they are looking for alternative options , '' says retail expert Nicole Higgins , who coaches entrepreneurs through her business The Buyer and Retail Coach . She adds that the global market for reusable pants alone is set to grow from $ 79 million -LRB- # 58 million -RRB- to $ 300 million over the next five years . The market is saturated -LRB- if you 'll excuse the pun -RRB- with environmentally friendlier options for the menarche . With bright colours and designs aimed at the increasingly young girls who use them , they promise to make menstruation at a young age easier to manage and less of a burden on the environment . `` Navigating pads and tampons can be very complicated for young girls , '' explains Ruby Raut , founder of period pants brand WUKA . `` Every girl knows how to use a pair of underwear . '' And with new products , comes a new form of `` period chat '' , says Lauren Derrett , who is about to launch a new reusable pads business called Wear 'em Out . `` Children today already know a lot of the basics , so it 's important that we shift to the impact of menstruation on the world . '' Jette Virdi , founder of organic tampons business ilo , reminds parents to remember that developments around gender may also affect the way we should talk about periods . It 's easy to be daunted by the responsibility of `` the chat '' , but parenting coach Alex Kremer says that if you 're honest and open you wo n't go far wrong . `` It 's incredibly important to keep the lines of communication open from an early age . Fostering honesty and openness from the beginning means it 's not an `` icky '' topic . We should be educating our children around changing bodies from an early age . '' Modern sanitary products - what 's available ? Period pants What they are : Absorbent pants that can be worn without tampons or towels -LRB- including at night -RRB- and then washed and reused . A seven pack of reusable pants from ModiBodi is # 117 , or Wuka 's First Period Pack is # 49.99 with the code FIRSTPERIOD and includes a bra and three pairs of pants . Pros : Very easy Cons : Initially expensive - constant washing and drying Menstrual cups What they are : Small silicon or latex rubber cups that catch menstrual blood rather than soaking it up . The best-known version is the Mooncup - available at Boots for # 21.99 , but there are many others available from specialist sites such as putacupinit.com , including those suitable for new users . Pros : Once mastered , these cups can be used for swimming , sleeping and during any day of your period and are cost effective over time . Cons : Initially difficult to use and may require a toilet cubicle with a sink inside , which is often unavailable in school Reusable sanitary towels What they are : Sanitary towels composed of manmade or natural fibres that are attached around ordinary pants with press studs and washed after use . Cheeky Wipes cloth sanitary pads are available at # 27.50 for a starter pack including five pads and a waterproof bag . Pros : Cost effective over time , easy to use and waste free Cons : Can be bulky and used towels must be carried home in a schoolbag , washed and dried Organic and biodegradable pads and tampons What they are : Versions of sanitary towels and tampons made of organic material , designed to biodegrade . Widely available - 16 Natracare cotton tampons are # 2.50 in Waitrose . Pros : The products we are all familiar with but with less worry about waste and chemicals . Cons : More expensive than traditional sanitary products and still ca n't be flushed , so will need to be composted . Do 's and do n'ts for a modern period chat DO Start early According to the ESRC International Centre for Lifecourse Studies at University College London , the average age to start your period is 12.9 , but anything over eight years old is considered normal . `` Secondary school is definitely too late , '' says Hayley Smith , founder of FlowAid , which provides free sanitary products for vulnerable and homeless women and girls . `` By Years 5 and 6 girls and boys will need this information . '' Parenting coach Kremer adds that it is n't just girls in primary school who should be taught about periods : the boys should too . `` They need to understand what their mothers/sisters/future girlfriends go through and how to support them . '' Mind your language Virdi , who owns organic tampon brand ilo , suggests examining the way you think and talk about your own period . `` Using words like ` dirty ' about used tampons can change the way girls feel about their periods - actually menstrual blood is very clean . Talking about being ` emotional ' during your period can have negative connotations too . '' DO N'T Focus on the bleeding `` Just informing a girl that they will bleed for seven days can be terrifying , unless you talk about why , '' says Virdi . Understanding the entire cycle means that girls will be ready for other symptoms , including hormonal fluctuations and even pain around ovulation . Try this useful factsheet for indepth information . Expect to be the expert It 's amazing how many of us go through our lives without understanding our own bodies , so before you try to help your child , you should do your homework first . Even once you 've gained the scientific expertise , your child might find your take on menstruation outdated , especially if you struggle with embarrassment around it . . Raut , from Wuka , believes that parents have much to learn from their children on this issue . `` Girls and boys these days are very open to having a conversation about periods , but the older generation were taught that periods are taboo and some kind of dirty thing . '' Resources from the Family Planning Association -LRB- FPA -RRB- can help with technical knowledge for you and your teen .", "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/parenting/having-period-talk-eco-warrior-child/", "kws": ["Parenting^^coach", "sustainability", "Planet^^Earth", "reusable^^period^^pants", "Rosie", "Rosie^^Murray-West", "period^^chat", "Menstrual^^cups", "Modern^^sanitary^^products", "veganism", "menstrual^^blood", "menstruation", "reusable^^pants", "tampons", "single-use^^plastic", "traditional^^sanitary^^products", "dirty^^thing", "gender", "free^^sanitary^^products", "Absorbent^^pants"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Lifestyle": 0.9997922778129578}, "second_cat": {"Lifestyle_Fitness": 0.9997922778129578}}}

All are made of salt water mixed with oils , antibodies , and enzymes , but they each also contain different molecules . Emotional tears , for example , carry protein-based hormones , including leucine-enkephalin , a natural painkiller released when the body is under stress . Onion tears are obviously of the reflex variety -- but what 's the irritant ? It turns out onions secrete a compound to deter predators -- aka some hungry human wielding a blade -- called lacrimatory factor . To cut down on its release , refrigerate the onion before slicing , then use a sharp knife to reduce the damage to the onion and the release of the compound . The Latin word for a tear , lacrima , is at the root of scientific tear-minology Tears are generated in the lacrimal gland , which sits above the eye just under the eyebrow . And the word lachrymist is used to describe someone who tears up a lot -LRB- also known by the unscientific term crybaby -RRB- . Babies do n't produce tears right away Actually , while babies cry a lot , they do n't produce tears until they are seven or eight months old , according to the American Academy of Pediatrics . You know who does shed a lot of tears ? Studies have found that women cry an average of 3.5 times a month , almost twice as much as men . On average , humans produce 15 to 30 gallons of tears a year . Crying can be good for you Some studies have shown a good cry can cause the release of oxytocin and endorphins , chemicals that make us feel better . Crying can also improve people 's sense of well-being by generating social support , researchers have found . On the other hand , crying can sometimes make you feel worse than if you had n't shed a tear One study found that people who are prone to crying in general more often feel worse after crying during a movie than people who rarely cry . The two biggest tearjerkers are ... According to Entertainment Weekly , the biggest Hollywood tearjerker of all time is Terms of Endearment , about how a family deals with a cancer diagnosis . Number 2 : Bambi . According to Merriam-Webster , the term tearjerker debuted in 1912 , which happens to be the same year the Titanic sank . -LRB- The movie Titanic is 16th on EW 's tearjerker list . -RRB- Ever wonder why a cry causes your nose to run ? Excess tears produced by the lacrimal glands flow into your tear ducts . From there , they drain into the nasal cavity , where they mix with mucus to give you a runny nose . For centuries , people thought tears were created in the human heart The Old Testament says they 're formed when part of the heart weakens and turns into water . In fact , many people cry in the Bible , though perhaps none explains the situation as poetically as David does in Psalm 56:8 , when he says to God : `` You keep track of all my sorrows . You have collected all my tears in your bottle . You have recorded each one in your book . '' In medieval times , crying was perfectly acceptable , even manly In the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf , when Beowulf is killed by a dragon , his warriors were `` disconsolate/and wailed aloud for their lord 's decease . '' King Arthur was also known to turn on the waterworks . Tear gas can be used on crowds , but not in war Speaking of war , tear gas was banned on the battlefield via the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993 , which was spurred by Iraq 's use of chemical weapons in Iran in the 1980s . That said , American law enforcement agencies can still legally use tear gas for crowd control . Charles Darwin was fascinated by tears For his book The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals , the father of evolution collected observations of South African monkeys and indigenous Australians and compared them with his own kids . Darwin concluded , `` We must look at weeping as an incidental result , as purposeless as the secretion of tears from a blow outside the eye ... yet this does not present any difficulty in our understanding how the secretion of tears serves as a relief to suffering . '' As we age , production of basal tears slows , which can lead to dry eyes Women going through hormonal changes such as pregnancy or menopause are particularly susceptible . To help the situation , try lubricating eye drops -LRB- also called artificial tears -RRB- or use warm compresses on your eyes for a few minutes .", "url": "https://www.rd.com/culture/facts-about-human-tears/", "kws": ["scientific^^tear-minology^^Tears", "emotional^^tears^^flow", "tears^^Basal^^tears", "artificial^^tears", "reflex^^tears", "Excess^^tears", "eyes", "dry^^eyes^^Women", "God", "Babies", "suffering", "people", "stress", "protein-based^^hormones", "irritants", "mucus", "enzymes", "oils", "chemicals", "evolution^^collected^^observations"], "text_category": {}}

Running from January 29 to February 13 , 2020 . Hey , Broke-Ass Readers ! Are you ready to encounter a beautiful nude woman with a glowing crucifix on her body ? How about seeing in person the man who brought the world `` The Great Rock ` N ' Roll Swindle ? '' Or do you want to hear the strange-but-true story of the attempt to create a `` Sundance of the East ? '' If you answered yes to at least one of these questions , you 're ready for the 2020 edition of the San Francisco Independent Film Festival aka S.F. IndieFest ! Running from January 29 to February 13 , 2020 , the 22nd edition of S.F. IndieFest comes to such venues as the Roxie Theatre -LRB- 3117-16th Street -RRB- , the Victoria Theatre -LRB- 2961-16th Street -RRB- , and the 518 Valencia Art Gallery -LRB- 518 Valencia , duh -RRB- . 21 countries supplied a total of 47 features and 57 shorts to this film festival which is a two week celebration of the independent and the subversive . Besides the films , there will also be parties and guest appearances galore . Because of the timing of this year 's IndieFest , there will be no anti-Valentine 's Day Power Ballad Sing-along this year . However , IndieFest attendees can still mock the Super Bowl -LRB- Super Bowl LIV : Men In Tights -RRB- or the Academy Awards -LRB- Up The Oscars Benefit Bash -RRB- . In addition , the Bawdy Caste gives `` The Big Lebowski '' the Live On Stage treatment . For Broke-Ass Readers interested in one-off parties , they should check out the `` American Psycho '' event . No , this is n't a party celebrating the well-deserved impeachment of the current occupant of the White House . Instead , it 's an homage to the 20th anniversary of Mary Harron 's dark comic adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis ' notorious serial killer novel . Now for those whose partying has n't left them too wasted to take in a movie , there are marquee events to consider . Festival Opening Night Film `` Woman In Motion '' offers a portrait of actress Nichelle Nichols -LRB- who will appear in person at the screening -RRB- . Todd Thompson 's documentary shows there was way more to the actress than playing Lt. Uhura on `` Star Trek '' TOS . Offscreen , Nichols worked with Martin Luther King , Jr. and led a successful nationwide blitz to diversify NASA 's astronaut base beyond white males . The Roxie Opening Night Film is `` Come As You Are , '' director Richard Wong 's -LRB- `` Colma The Musical '' -RRB- remake of the Belgian comedy `` Hasta La Vista . '' In this seriocomic film , a trio of differently-abled adult men still living with their parents take a road trip to Montreal . There , they intend to visit a brothel that caters to special needs clients so they can lose their virginity . For something sexual which goes a lot darker , check out B. Harrison Smith 's `` The Special . '' It 's what might be described as a sort of Glory Hole Horror . The title refers to a brothel 's unusual sexual gratification option . It 's a box with the words `` Stick It In Here '' written on its side and an arrow pointing to a dark hole . For a possibly cuckolded husband , The Special delivers comfort before becoming a source of obsession . Readers who prefer the tamer thrills of athletics might want to check out Coan `` Buddy '' Nichols and Rick Charnosky 's documentary `` The Tony Alva Story . '' At age 62 , subject Alva is the world 's oldest professional skateboarder . He 's also the man referred to as the godfather of modern day skateboarding . After the film , viewers can talk to Alva in person . For those interested in more unusual sports , they might want to learn about competitive pigeon flying . That 's the subject of `` Pigeon Kings . '' San Francisco native Milena Pastreich 's documentary follows a Los Angeles group of South Central black and Latino breeders over several years as they breed flocks of Roller Pigeons for World Cup competition . For a more unusual take on man-nature relations , check out Dan Wayne 's documentary `` Big Fur . '' Its subject is a champion taxidermist trying to create a life-size Bigfoot . This project is n't aimed at providing him more fame and glory . Instead , his replica might inspire others to find the real Bigfoot . By contrast , the project at the center of `` The Planters '' would be considered of dubious inspirational value . No , Alexandra Kotcheff and Hannah Leder 's comedy has nothing to do with a certain well-known peanut company . Instead , the title refers in part to telemarketer Martha 's ongoing project of burying boxes of `` treasure '' for discovery by other residents of her desert town . The telemarketer 's now `` assisted '' by her new childlike guest Sadie , who has multiple personality disorder . Add in stop-motion fantasy sequences , and the result is what the IndieFest program guide calls a gentle-spirited David Lynch film . -LRB- For those who prefer the David Lynch of `` Blue Velvet '' and `` Eraserhead , '' the Pacific Film Archive 's David Lynch film series has just started up . -RRB- Yasuhiko Shimizu 's `` Vise '' is just one of S.F. IndieFest 's more bonkers offerings . It begins as the story of an aspiring model who figures she needs a smaller face . A surgeon uses a vise to fulfill the wannabe model 's desire . The film soon brings in a love story , a `` man on the run '' tale , and lots of violence . This year 's IndieFest 's best weird title is `` Jesus Shows You The Way To The Highway . '' It 's the story of a CIA Special Agent whose pizzeria business dreams have been sidelined by a mission to save the world from a big-time threat . However , destroying the computer virus code-named `` Soviet Union '' proves a lot more difficult when his mission turns out to be a trap . What makes this familiar tale way different is what else director Miguel Llanso adds to the story mix . This film might be for you if you like mashing together Afro-futurism , psychedelia , lots of reality-warping , and even stop motion animation with live human actors . The IndieFest offering which turns the gonzo craziness dial up to 11 , though , is Seth Ickerman 's `` Blood Machines . '' It 's a sequel to the director 's Carpenter Brut music video and YouTube sensation `` Turbo Killer . '' Two space mercenaries attempt to hunt down the Mima . It 's a rogue ship piloted by an AI seeking to free itself from human control . But when a beautiful nude woman with a glowing crucifix on her body emerges from the eventually disabled ship , it 's `` do machines have souls '' time . The visual style of the film mixes together such influences as John Carpenter , Chris Foss ' spaceship art , heavy doses of neon , and 1980s B-movies . Add in some synthwave tunes , and you 're ready to fly through the reaches of space . Speaking of mixing music and film , this year 's recipient of the IndieFest Philo T. Farnsworth Award For Innovative Filmmaking is rock ` n ' roll filmmaker Julien Temple . His career has been marked by inventive ways of bringing rock to the cinema screen . Not only will Temple be here in person , but a couple of very special films he helmed will be shown at IndieFest . His newest film `` Ibiza : The Silent Movie '' takes viewers on a musical tour of the culture and history of the White Island as it faces the twin threats of wealthy socialites ' annual invasion and gentrification . Presented in 35 mm , `` The Great Rock ` N ' Roll Swindle '' is Temple 's classic mockumentary about the rise and fall of The Sex Pistols . If you missed `` Cat Sticks '' at the recent Third I Film Festival , you 've got a second chance to see Ronny Sen 's Slamdance sensation . This oddly beautiful black and white Indian film follows a group of drug addicts over the course of one long rain-soaked night . They 're all searching for the drug high of `` brown sugar '' with various degrees of success . Alternately tragic , oddly funny , and even unexpectedly beautiful , this is a do n't miss offering . By contrast , just one outsider faces a hostile world in IndieFest 's Centerpiece Film , Riddhi Majumder 's `` Pariah . '' The title character may just be a stranger who 's left a forest to go to an idyllic nearby village to obtain food . But the village 's local despot whips up the villagers ' suspicion and hatred to the point of regarding the stranger 's presence as `` an attack on our society and culture . '' The resulting mass hysteria leads to tragic results . A tragedy of a far different sort is chronicled in Jason Cohn 's documentary `` The First Angry Man . '' There was a time when providing city , state , and federal government services was n't characterized by constant cutbacks or lack of money . That situation changed for the worst four decades ago with Howard Jarvis and his notoriously successful Proposition 13 campaign . Cohn 's film tells the story of Jarvis ' campaign and its ennobling of selfishly refusing to pay for one 's share of the common good . In Bob Byington 's new polarizing comedy `` Frances Ferguson , '' the titular snarky Nebraska substitute teacher is highly dissatisfied with her life . But her solution , having an affair with one of her students , sets her off on a downward spiral which includes jail time and unwanted celebrity . Take one French film producer , her husband -LRB- who used to be a mafioso -RRB- , and a small town full of people excited at the possibility of becoming movie stars . This is not fiction , but an actual account of an attempt to create a Sundance Of The East . The end result is Martha Shane 's documentary `` Narrowsburg . '' Do n't forget that IndieFest also offers half-a-dozen short film programs . Take time to check one or two of them out , as you might luck out and see the early creative steps of a future famous filmmaker . Some of the shorts to be shown include `` Wavy Tales '' -LRB- ordinary people asked how their microwave ovens work come up with some truly bizarre answers -RRB- , `` Compartmentalization Storage Facility '' -LRB- a special facility where customers can literally store their personal issues in rented compartments -RRB- , and `` All Eyes On Me '' -LRB- tattoo request by a girl from a religious family involves a sentence expressing all her religious beliefs -RRB- . For those whose cinematic tastes run more towards international film noir , IndieFest has you covered with `` The Wild Goose Lake . '' The new film from director Diao Yinan -LRB- `` Black Coal , Thin Ice '' -RRB- concerns the consequences of an underworld gathering going badly wrong . Imagine such film noir staples as rain-slicked alleyways and the neons of cheap diners -LRB- nighttime noodle shops here -RRB- playing out in an unnamed Chinese city , and you 'll get an idea of what to expect with Diao 's film . An IndieFest offering which has its Chinese protagonist going for the unexpected is `` Lucky Grandma . '' Sasie Sealy 's film concerns an ornery chain-smoking 80-year-old grandmother who wants to live independently in New York City 's Chinatown . Her decision to head to the nearest casino and go all-in on a possible lucky streak leads to her eventually getting stuck in the middle of a Chinatown gang war . Closing Night Film `` Alice '' won the Narrative Feature -- Grand Jury Award at SXSW . The title character in Josephine Mackerras ' film is a wife and mother who makes the unpleasant discovery that her husband has bankrupted their family by blowing all their money on hookers . In a last ditch effort to support herself and her kid , Alice becomes a high-end escort . Do n't hold your breath waiting for the MRA crowd to cheer Alice 's efforts . Obviously , there are other IndieFest programs that have n't been mentioned such as a chance to enjoy bad art -LRB- `` Bad Art Gallery '' -RRB- or a film pitting treasure hunting geocachers against some very pissed off mutant boar men -LRB- `` Wild Boar '' -RRB- . Just know that if you prefer your movie fare to offer offbeat alternatives to cookie-cutter Hollywood fare , you need to make time for S.F. IndieFest . -LRB- Note : Broke-Ass Stuart 's is an S.F.

They won '' t say .", "content": "Multiple classes with no material citation Multiple schools that offer extensive training and educational opportunities on LGBT issues are refusing to say where they get their instructional material , who writes it , and who on campus is qualified to teach it . Drexel University , Duke University , Georgia Tech and the University of California , Davis all have active and dedicated LGBT resource organizations that offer students numerous opportunities for learning about lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender culture . The websites for these organizations offer very little information about where the material for those classes and workshops come from . The College Fix reached out to each organization multiple times via email and phone asking for that information . None offered it . Reached via phone Wednesday evening , a representative from UC-Davis 's LGBTQIA Resource Center said The Fix ` s queries would be passed on to a supervisor . ` Foundational information ' The LGBTQIA Resource Center at the University of California , Davis offers students an `` Ally Training '' workshop that covers `` foundational information about sex , gender identity , gender expression , and sexual orientation in a socio-historical context . '' Those who take part in this program `` have the opportunity to examine their knowledge and beliefs and begin the process of critiquing paradigms and systems that are harmful to LGBTQIA people , '' the website says . The organization also offers a `` guide to pronouns for allies , '' an `` LGBTQIA ally tips '' resource , and a `` words that hurt '' section on their site . In its `` ally tips '' section , the resource center presents a whopping 58 tips to keep in mind when interacting with and learning about the LGBT community . The school calls on students to `` confront '' transphobia , says `` transgender women '' should have access to `` women-only '' spaces , and tells cisgendered students to come to terms with their `` privilege and prejudice . '' Elsewhere the page advises : `` Do n't out trans people . This could be dangerous to their safety . Likewise , be aware of your surroundings when discussing trans issues with a trans person . For their safety & comfort , they may prefer not to discuss these topics in public places or among strangers . '' `` Words that hurt , '' according to their website include `` he-she , '' `` you guys , '' `` illegal alien , '' `` crazy '' and `` dumb . '' Each item includes an explanation as to why the words in question are hurtful . `` He-she , '' for example , is said to be `` demeaning and invalidates an individual 's identity and the pronouns that they use . '' ` Basic introduction ' to LGBT issues Drexel University , meanwhile , offers students an `` LGBT 101 Training Session '' that provides `` a basic introduction to issues relevant to lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender , queer and questioning -LRB- LGBTQ -RRB- people . '' It is not evident from the event listing who teaches the course . The school also offers a `` Gender and Sexuality Resource Space , '' though it is not clear whether it is a physical space or if it is merely a webfront or something else . The school website describes it as `` a place for everyone ... a friendly , supportive environment for people of all sexual orientation and gender identities to explore , celebrate , and educate the campus community about the diverse gender and sexual identities . '' In Durham , North Carolina , Duke University 's Center For Sexual and Gender Diversity offers `` Trans 101 \u2033 training . The website says this curriculum `` serve -LSB- s -RSB- as an introductory workshop to allow students , staff , and faculty the opportunity to learn about identities related to sex , gender , gender identity , and gender expression ; learn about the vast experiences of members of the trans community ; and begin exploring systems of privilege and oppression resulting in transphobia and cissexism . '' Duke , meanwhile offers `` P.R.I.D.E. Training . '' The program , the acronym of which stands for `` Pursuing Respect , Inclusion , Diversity , and Equity , '' is touted as a `` signature educational program aimed at increasing awareness of issues impacting those with marginalized sexual orientations , gender identities and gender expressions . '' Students can receive `` Responsible Conduct of Research '' credit for attending the training Georgia Tech 's LGBTQIA Resource Center also offers a `` Trans 101 '' course to help students define transgender terms , be more `` inclusive , '' and understand the `` barriers '' transgender people reportedly face . The resource center actually offers around half a dozen different types of training , including `` Safe Space '' instruction , `` Level Up '' -LRB- described as `` an advanced allyship course '' -RRB- and `` Greek Allies .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrJknIt", "title": "` Party of Five ' 1 \u00d7 03 Review : Living for the Moments", "content": "I remember feeling two distinct things when this reboot was announced : joy , because it felt like it was a story that needed to be told , and a great deal of apprehension . How do you put these kids in a situation where they have to truly fend for themselves if they can just call their parents whenever they need to ? This is 2020 , after all . Technology rules our lives . Plus that 's without even going into the would they actually cast latinx actors , hire latinx writers and care to faithfully represent a culture that 's supposed to be what the show is all about . And then , `` Long Distance '' finally addressed my apprehension with the story-line head on , and like everything this show has done in it 's first three episodes -LRB- and before , when they DID hire the latinx actors and writers -RRB- , it absolutely worked . So , join us as we discuss the sibling dynamics , Vanessa , and what separation really does to you as we talk `` Long Distance '' : WHAT VANESSA WANTS The most hilarious -LRB- in a bad way -RRB- thing about Emilio and Beto `` fighting '' over Vanessa -LRB- if you can even call what they 're doing fighting -RRB- , is the fact that neither of them mentions that it does n't really matter what they want -- all that matters is what Vanessa wants , and she 's made that clear . She is n't a prize to be won , not a reward for good behavior . She 's a person , with her own wants and desires . Of course , it is n't on Emilio to mention this . Vanessa made a choice , and he does n't really owe Beto an explanation for something he did n't even know Beto was thinking about . Except , for Beto , it 's hard to see this clearly , to realize he 's being unfair to his brother , and to Vanessa too . Beto is just too caught up on what it feels to lose one after another after another . But then again , we are not in this journey because the characters are perfect . We do n't expect them to be . We 're in this journey because it 's just that , a journey . And when it comes the romantic part of it , as long as both Emilio and Beto respect what Vanessa wants , then I 'm perfectly fine with however this weird-ass love triangle ends up going . Though , if I 'm being honest , it 's hard for me to see Emilio and Vanessa lasting -- at least , considering what we know now . We 've seen her have sex with Emilio , and connect with Beto , which says A LOT . Besides , Beto is n't going to be 16 forever , and I really hope we 're here for enough of this journey that we can really invest in where this is going . THE MOMENTS IN BETWEEN The conversation between Beto and his mom was heart-wrenching , just as the conversation between Gloria and Valentina was , but in the end , I feel like they all did -- or at least tried to do -- what they had to do for these kids to be able to move forward . Not forget , of course not . Their parents are alive . Rafa might not remember them as well as the others , but no one is going to forget them . This is n't a question of mourning them and then just letting them go , but this is a matter of balance . Their parents are still gone , far away and as unfair as that is , that 's reality . And the only way they can all move on and have some semblance of a normal life is by trying to actually live . It especially sucks for Valentina , of course , because she 's a kid . Lucia and Beto , and especially Emilio , are older , and they can process better . Rafa is too young to even understand what 's going on . But Valentina is in that age when she needs her parents the most , where she 's figuring out who she is , what she wants , and she does n't have them . But Valentina is n't alone , and what Beto is doing , what they 're all doing is simply the best they can under the circumstances . Hard to blame them for that . I JUST WANT TO GIVE EMILIO A HUG I 'm not sure if it 's because I 'm also the oldest in my family , but I basically want to give Emilio a hug 24/7 . I wish everyone would cut him some slack , because he 's trying , really really hard . And no , he does n't have everything figured out , and yes , he 's still an immature kid in many ways , but he is trying . What else can we ask of him ? The latinx community is both incredibly welcoming , and super , super harsh . It 's a dichotomy I 've experienced from the inside and have always had trouble understanding . We 'll open our house up to friends and friends of friends , we will be there for our family , unconditionally , whenever they need us . We will go out of our way to help people , over and over again , even to our own detriment sometimes . And yet , we will also hold them up to impossible standards and judge them for not getting everything right . You take the good with the bad , I guess . That 's a little bit of what 's going on with Emilio . He 's damned if he does , dammed if he does n't . Except , in this case , he has no choice but to do , over and over again . No matter what the rest of the world -- or his family -- has to say . So , yes . Hug . I volunteer . Things I think I think : Something else is going on with Matthew , and I 'm super interested in knowing what it is . I 'm also super glad he 's around . We barely saw Rafa this week . Who was taking care of him ? I 'm glad they have n't dropped the `` good immigrant vs bad immigrant '' comparison , even if there 's a different component to it this week . How 's that pizzeria making so much money ?! Something does n't add up . Would this show feel as relevant if Barrack Obama was President ? What about Hillary Clinton ? I will never get over how good the makeup/wardrobe department on this show is at making these kids look like KIDS , while still looking good enough for TV . So often teenage shows just make the kids look like freaking supermodels , and it 's super hard to relate to people who always look perfect . Agree ? Disagree ?

Only out of necessity , he answered , never for pleasure . We doubt that . But again , it was a job interview , so lying is almost expected . Cussin ' has a long and inglorious history in this country , and maybe all countries . That old German monk Martin Luther is said to have had a potty mouth . Some American generals could curse their troops to victory . If the lyrics of `` Louie , Louie '' are even close to what we heard in the junior high locker room , the censors missed a beaut . There is a very human need to cuss . Even if it 's just notafinga ! -- as the old man in the Christmas story shouted as he tried to fix his major award . -LRB- We knew a Cajun lady who never said a curse word , ever . But the glare she gave us once while saying , `` Fiddlesticks ! '' could have peeled paint . -RRB- Language is supposed to be a distinguishing mark of the species . Like the use of tools . And according to a study a couple years ago , cursing could even reduce pain . So , it 's also aspirin ! But one group is having a cow about Burger King 's latest commercial . In the ad , a young man says , while chewing a veggie burger , `` Damn , that 's good . '' The problem should be that he 's talking with his mouth full , which is rude . But he used the D word , and so One Million Moms has complained . Yes , that One Million Moms -- the group that got the commercial featuring a gay wedding pulled from the Hallmark Channel , before it was restored by more clear-thinking people at the network . Having lost that battle , OMM charged into the Burger King lines and its newest commercial for the Impossible Burger : `` Burger King 's Impossible Whopper ad is irresponsible and tasteless . It is extremely destructive and damaging to impressionable children viewing the commercial . We all know children repeat what they hear . '' What the hell ? Extremely destructive ? Damaging ? Have you seen what passes for video games today ? Or movies ? If some dude choking down a burger murmurs the word `` damn , '' we doubt the damage . Kids are hearing worse than that walking to second-grade lunch . According to the group 's website , more than 8,000 people have `` taken action '' against Burger King for the offending commercial . And although that sounds like a lot of people with too much time on their hands , 8,000 is considerably less than a million . So it seems even those who 'd join a group like One Million Moms probably do n't give a damn about this commercial , one way or the other . But for the record , some of us must defend the cursed word . Words are powerful things . Like guns , some should never be taken out of the cabinet . But when you 're walking down a path in a beautiful Arkansas forest , and a bear or wild boar appears out of nowhere , what are you gon na scream ? Fiddlesticks ? Who 's going to come to the aid of fiddlesticks ? And what self-respecting bear would be afraid of the word ? No , no , no . At that point , we 're all in . And anything said in earshot of Mama has to be forgiven . And , it should be asked , what about inner harmony ? Forget mere fear . What about anger ? When the bike is put together the night before the birthday party , but there are four nuts and one bolt left , sometimes it takes a murmured cuss to restore the humors before you pick up the instructions to start over . As Twain reminds , sometimes swearing is a necessity . As the old song says , it 's in ` im , and it got to come out . At the same time , remember : never for pleasure . If somebody curses like a drill sergeant all day long , what 's he supposed to say when he stubs his toe at night ? By then , all the good ones have been taken . But if words , especially cuss words , are held close to the vest , they can have a powerful impact . An editor we know bounced into work one day full of spirit . He looked like he 'd just got a birthday card in the mail . His step was light and his day was going swell . He asked what the rest of us were up to . The answer : Reading the wire . And that day , more Americans had died in Iraq . Another bombing , we told him , and the body count was high . We 've never heard this editor curse before or since . But we remember his shoulders sagging as he turned away , and his muttering softly : `` God dammit . '' The point stuck . He was hurt . He was no longer full of spirit . His day was ruined . When you hold words in reserve , and only use them when they are absolutely necessary , they can have a powerful impact . A few years ago , if you 'll remember , the California legislature -- have we got your attention ? -- attempted to pass a solemn resolution to mark the first week of March as , get this , Cuss Free Week . As if any government has a say about when you slam your hand in the car door . Imagine a group of lawmakers with enough ego that they 'd tell you when you could belt out a good ` un , and when you could n't . What would they do to somebody who discovers a 200-foot-long black snake in the garden ? The air is still blue over our backyard from when one of those bastards showed up . We suppose we would have been in violation of the state code , no matter the legal efforts at regulation . Besides , March is when we plant the spring crops around here . If we let One Million Moms , or just 8,000 of them , push a Burger King commercial off the air , what next ? Is Damgoode Pies going to stop advertising ? Will we have to change the name of Little Rock 's Big Dam Bridge ? To hell with that . We doubt there really are folks out there so pure as to be offended by the latest veggie burger commercial . But they seem adamant that people think they are . So they have to issue earnest and grave press releases to showcase their virtue . If this recent ado/brouhaha/performance seems like just a lot of B.S. , join the club . While you 're here , have a veggie burger . Just do n't talk with your mouth full .", "url": "https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2020/jan/16/editorial-what-the-hell-is-wrong-with-p/", "kws": ["God", "cuss^^words", "cursing", "people", "Cussin", "mere^^fear", "powerful^^things", "Mama", "movies", "swearing", "Kids", "Mark^^Twain", "pleasure", "Caliban", "guns", "Burger^^King", "spirit", "B.S.", "impressionable^^children", "Louie"], "text_category": {}}

0.0	{"docid": "0NrKAILt", "title": "Stewart leads likable cast of ludicrous sci-fi horror flick ` Underwater '", "content": "When the movies give us a small band of survivors battling unknown forces in outer space or in the future or in a cabin in the woods , they never give us six of one certain type of character or a half-dozen of another . We do n't get SIX wisecracking comic relief guys who keep the jokes coming every step of the way , or a whole group of father - or mother-figure captain types willing to go down with the ship , or an entire team of inexperienced , terrified newbies who turn out to be more than up to the challenge , etc. . We get one of each ! Such is the case with the bottom-of-the-ocean , near-bottom-of-the-barrel , highly derivative and ultimately laughably ludicrous sci-fi horror flick `` Underwater , '' which MIGHT seem reasonably original if nobody had ever seen any of the `` Alien '' movies . Eh . Not even then . Despite some impressive production design , a few promising moments early on and valiantly sincere performances from a likable cast led by Kristen Stewart , `` Underwater '' eventually sinks like a half-ton boulder dropped into the sea . That 's in large part due to the increasingly murky visuals that might well capture what it would look like to be fighting for your life some 7 miles beneath the surface of the ocean , but they make for one maddening and irritating viewing experience . At times the screen was so muddy I found myself wishing for the world 's largest bottle of Windex . Director William Eubank -LRB- who exhibits some talent for artfully framed shots -RRB- plunges us right into the madness from the get-go . There 's almost zero exposition other than an opening title sequence explaining there 's a massive research project at the bottom of the Marianas Trench , involving a crew of 316 literally disturbing the deepest floor of the Pacific Ocean in the interest of , I do n't know , mining for minerals and corporate greed and messing with Mother Nature and stuff like that . Follow that intro with a few lines of melancholy , existential voice-over ruminations from Kristen Stewart 's Norah , and BOOM ! Just like that , the entire underwater operation is rocked by what appears to be an enormous earthquake , nearly destroying the lab and leaving only a precious few survivors . Spoiler alert ! That ai n't no earthquake . There are some ... creatures at the bottom of the sea , and they appear to be close cousins to so many voracious , lizard-like , vaguely humanoid , sharp-toothed monsters we 've seen in so many other movies . In addition to Norah , a mechanical engineer who has the resourcefulness of John McClane in `` Die Hard '' when it comes to sussing out a problem and doing whatever it takes to survive , we meet : \u2022 The Captain -LRB- Vincent Cassel -RRB- , a divorced father who says there 's only one way to safety : everyone must embark on a long and dangerous space walk , I mean , ocean floor walk , to reach the control center for the main drill , which contains these cool pods that will launch you right up to the surface of the ocean just in the nick of time . How about that ! \u2022 Paul -LRB- T.J. Miller -RRB- , a lovable , wisecracking but also brave goofball with tattoos covering his torso , a stuffed bunny he adopts as a mascot -- and a joke for every occasion . \u2022 Smith -LRB- John Gallagher Jr. -RRB- , a solid and reliable good guy who 's in love with Emily -LRB- Jessica Henwick -RRB- , a young research assistant who is in a constant state of panic and keeps saying things like , `` I ca n't do this ! '' and , `` I 've never seen anyone die before ! '' Stewart 's Norah rocks a Slim Shady-era Eminem haircut and is a badass , take-charge heroine , even as the filmmakers keep finding excuses to have her stripped down to sports bra and panties . -LRB- Ooh , shades of Ripley in `` Alien , '' only far more gratuitous and obvious . -RRB- Norah seems to be the only one in the group who knew everyone else before the calamity , including the occasional corpse they come across , sometimes in straight-out `` Jaws '' fashion . Leave it to good ol' Norah to identify the body and explain who that was . Thanks , Norah ! As the team tries to make its way to safety , `` Underwater '' shamelessly borrows from films ranging from `` 2001 : A Space Odyssey '' to `` Gravity '' to `` Godzilla '' in its never-ending quest to scare us out of our seats and amp up the drama . Making matters worse , the screenplay overdoes it by giving tragic back stories to certain characters -- as if the epic , life-or-death struggles they 're currently facing are n't enough . Ah , now we understand the DEEPER meanings behind their actions . Sigh . `` Underwater '' breaks no new ground as a sci-fi horror flick -- other than as a possible contender for the murkiest movie ever made .

'' \u2022 On social media giant Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers : `` He tries to be more famous than a player . '' \u2022 On criticism taken from then-Houston guard Iman Shumpert : `` I 'm not worried about a guy who 's going into retirement soon . '' Portland coach Terry Stotts is underrated as a funny guy . Some examples of his dry wit : \u2022 Joking after a practice session after having not practiced for a long spell : `` We practice once a month , whether we need it or not . '' \u2022 Joking again after the Blazers ran up a season-high 28 fast-break points in a blowout of Charlotte -LRB- going in , Portland ranked 23rd in the league with 10.7 fast-break points per game -RRB- : `` I finally took the reins off them and said ` Go ahead , let it go . ' '' \u2022 Asked before the Blazers-Nuggets playoff series if Denver 's altitude would affect his players in games played there : `` I do n't know . You trying to get into my head ? '' Swingman Evan Turner is now with Atlanta , probably still spewing gems for the media to enjoy . While with Portland , `` ET '' offered a few for the local scribes : \u2022 After notching back-to-back triple-doubles off the bench : `` I 'm just gon na start lobbying for a spot in the rafters now . '' \u2022 On why he preferred the Los Angeles Clippers as a first-round playoff opponent : `` Just for selfish reasons . Nice weather ; easy flight ; nice weather . Everybody wants a little sun . Being in LA , I start switching over from cotton to silk . Get my sexy on . I got some sunglasses I want to wear . Mostly for fashion reasons . '' \u2022 After the Blazers ' victory in Game 7 of the Denver series : `` Pressure can bust pipes or make diamonds . We never thought we were going to lose . '' CJ McCollum is a former sportswriter -- sports editor of the Lehigh Brown and White -- so he knows the value of delivering a good quote : \u2022 Asked at what point he was thinking about going for a triple-double in a game against Atlanta in which he got his first career triple-double : `` Probably the last possession . Honestly , I was just trying to get through the game and get home and relax , watch some Netflix . '' \u2022 Looking ahead to Game 7 of the Denver playoff series : `` We understand what 's at stake . Somebody 's got to go to Cabo or Cancun , as Chuck -LRB- Barkley -RRB- would say . '' \u2022 Asked about load management through the 2019-20 season , he referred to another NBA guard , Kawhi Leonard : `` The race in the West is tight . I do n't know if we can afford to ` Kawhi it , ' so to speak . You 'll Kawhi your way out of the playoffs . '' More Blazer , and ex-Blazer , stuff -LRB- Warning : these are NBA players , not missionaries , and some of their word choices reflect that -RRB- : \u2022 `` With about eight -LRB- seconds -RRB- on the clock , I said out loud , ` We 've seen this too many times before . This is going to be unbelievable . He 's going to make this shot , and we 're going to move on to the second round . ' And sure enough . '' -- former Blazer Meyers Leonard , on Damian Lillard 's 37-foot playoff series-winner against Oklahoma City . \u2022 `` I 'm getting rid of these mother -- -- s tomorrow . I 'm going to get the last laugh , I promise you that . '' -- Lillard , privately to friends , the day before his Game 5 shot eliminated the Thunder , according to Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports . \u2022 `` I hope everybody back in Mississippi is smiling right now . '' -- Rodney Hood , a Meridian , Mississippi , native , after scoring a career playoff-high 25 points in a Game 6 playoff win over the Nuggets . \u2022 `` He is really weird , man . A lot of people wear flip-flops , but they wear socks -- really thick socks -- with them . But this guys wears literally nothing in the winter but just sandals . I 'm like , ` You 're not gon na get sick . ' It 's just his genes are different . I do n't know what kind of genes he got , but it 's different . '' -- Enes Kanter on former OKC teammate Steven Adams . Steve Kerr is another friend of the column , having contributed front-line quotes for many years . The Golden State mentor did n't disappoint in 2019 , either : \u2022 After a playoff victory over Houston completed without star forward Kevin Durant : `` Our guys are f -- - giants . Sorry , Mom . '' \u2022 After winning Game 5 of the NBA Finals but losing Durant to a ruptured Achilles tendon : `` An incredible win and a horrible loss at the same time . '' \u2022 After a flop by L.A. Clippers guard Patrick Beverley : `` It looked like -LRB- Mike -RRB- Tyson punched him in the face . ... I worry that he 's going to get whiplash on some of those flops . '' \u2022 About his boss -LRB- Warriors GM Bob Myers -RRB- : `` The first championship habit is a GM having a habit of bringing in great players . So we 've got that one down . '' \u2022 After President Trump said Kerr looked like a `` little boy '' when he declined comment on the China controversy launched with Houston GM Daryl Morey 's tweet about Hong Kong : `` It was really surprising , but mainly because it was me . Then you stop and think -- this is just every day -LRB- with Trump -RRB- . There was another -LRB- foil -RRB- today . There will be a new one tomorrow . And the circus will go on . '' Stephen Curry , also criticized by the president for not visiting the White House , after Trump 's admonishment of Kerr : `` I got ta welcome Steve to the club . '' Curry , thin-skinned to media criticism after the Warriors were blown out of their first two games of the 2019-20 season : `` It 's easy to throw darts at a team trying to figure it out . Say whatever you want to fill that 24-hour news cycle . It 's cool with us . '' Durant did a nice job avoiding self-modesty more than once : \u2022 After LeBron James picked him first on his team for the All-Star Game : `` What else is he supposed to do ? '' \u2022 On Durant 's motivation to opt out of his contract with Golden State and sign a free-agent contract : `` I just want to make sure I get as much money as I can on my next deal so I can stack up my money and figure it out . That 's the plan -- play basketball and stack money . '' \u2022 On Durant 's distaste for the league that allows him to be a multimillionaire : `` Some days , I hate the NBA . Some days , I hate the circus of the NBA . Some days , I hate that the players let the fame that comes with the business alter their minds about the game . Sometimes , I do n't like being around the executives and the politics that come with it . I hate that . '' \u2022 Former Golden State teammate Draymond Green , before Durant signed with Brooklyn , on his teammate 's potential move into free agency : `` If he go , he go . '' Jimmy Butler is normally not a quote machine , but as he moved from Minnesota to Philadelphia to Miami in little over a year , he had things to say : \u2022 Rocking the double negatives when asked about his relationship with former Minnesota teammates : `` I do n't think nobody is going to take nothing personal . '' \u2022 On his reputation : `` I do n't think I 'm that bad a guy . I 'm not an a-hole like everybody thinks I am . I 'm a little extra at times . I do n't think there 's too much wrong with that , either . '' \u2022 On his behavior : `` Damn right I 'm confrontational . I would be the first to tell you ; I do n't give a damn . I 've always been like that . I have n't said it all the time -- I 've always acted it , though . ... I do n't give a damn what you say , because you do n't know what I go through . '' \u2022 As Nurkic notes , Philadelphia center Embiid will never have a self-image problem . Said Embiid : `` I 'm the most unstoppable player in the league . '' \u2022 More Embiid : `` I do n't like shooting 3 's , but you 're not going to disrespect me by giving me a lot of space . In that situation , I 'm going to shoot it . I 'm Joel Embiid . I do n't get disrespected ; I do the disrespecting . '' Doc Rivers is not popular with Blazer fans , but he 's another friend to the column : \u2022 After Kawhi Leonard left NBA champion Toronto to sign with the Clippers : `` It 's not like he left on bad terms , really . It 's one of those leave-good situations , not one of those leave-awful situations . '' \u2022 On the hapless Cleveland Cavaliers : `` They have n't had the year they wanted . Or maybe they have -- I 'm not so sure . '' Singular gems from the year in the NBA : \u2022 `` They 're Brady and Gronk -- the black version . '' -- Golden State 's Andre Iguodala , on teammates Stephen Curry and Draymond Green . \u2022 `` This is kind of a Dirk-and-Nash type of situation , only these guys are taller . '' -- Dallas coach Rick Carlisle , on acquiring Kristas Porzingas to pair with Luka Doncic . `` A lot of people , because of Kyrie 's announcement at the beginning of the year , thought it was a marriage . I think it 's more like an engagement . And we 're going to get married on July 1 . '' -- Boston GM Danny Ainge , in February on hopes the Celtics could re-sign Kyrie Irving if he opted out of his contract after the 2018-19 season . \u2022 `` You guys are part of the destruction of locker rooms . '' -- Irving to reporters as part of a rambling , long-winded discourse in a media session in February after he revealed he may not be re-signing with Boston after all . He wound up with Brooklyn . \u2022 `` F -- - patience ! I want to play . I 've been patient long enough . What do I got to be patient for ? It 's time . What are we waiting for ? If I 'm out there , play me . '' -- Miami 's Dion Waiters , after playing 12 minutes against Milwaukee seven games after returning from ankle surgery . Waiters was responding to coach Erik Spoelstra 's comment that Waiters must wait to see significant playing time because of the team 's depth and the seriousness of his injury . \u2022 `` Get to the f-ing playoffs before you speak to me . '' -- Russell Westbrook to Minnesota 's Karl-Anthony Towns and Dario Saric during a Timberwolves-Thunder game . Minnesota won 131-120 . \u2022 `` I probably s -- t my pants . '' -- Milwaukee 's Giannis Antetokoumpo , recalling his first career start against the New York Knicks and Carmelo Anthony in 2013 . n `` Ben Simmons is a great player in transition . And once you get him into half-court , he 's average . '' -- Brooklyn 's Jared Dudley . \u2022 `` I do n't have an ego -- it 's dead . It had to die for me to be who I am . Sometimes when you want to become who you want to be , you have to die within yourself . Once you learn that you have to give up yourself for the team , that 's when things flourish . '' -- Dwight Howard , after being waived by Memphis , his fifth team in five years . He eventually signed with the L.A. Lakers . \u2022 `` I think I became the scapegoat . I just got to the point where it was , ` Oh , it 's just Willie 's fault . ' And that s -- t drained me . I 'm all about energy and love and s -- t , and to have to come to the spot where I thought I had a lot of love and it was up in the air -- it just felt weird . '' -- Willie Cauley-Stein , on Sacramento allowing him to go into free agency . \u2022 `` People used to think they could tell me how to do my job . That has n't changed , except now they 're telling me how to preach . '' -- Former NBA referee Steve Javie , now a deacon at a Catholic church in Newtown , Pennsylvania . \u2022 `` That 's what my mom told me . Somebody hits you , you hit their ass back . So I think my mom would be proud of what he did . '' -- Minnesota 's Jordan Bell , after teammate Karl-Anthony Towns got into a confrontation with Embiid . Bell and Embiid each drew a two-game NBA suspension . Charles Barkley is always a contributor to this column . We thank him for his years of service : \u2022 On his studio job with TNT : `` I 'm 56 years old , and I 've never had a real job . And I 'm not looking for one . I 'm going to ride this TV thing out . '' \u2022 After a statue of him was erected on Legends Walk outside of the Philadelphia 76ers ' arena : `` I do n't know if I 've ever been that skinny . '' \u2022 And , on a personal note , after hearing my voice asking a question in a postgame conference during the playoffs , Charles Barkley made this remark : `` Man , Kerry Eggers is still there ?

Instead , it was undercover officers . That 's according to court documents released Wednesday in Door County , Wisconsin . Many of the details in these 14 pages are too explicit for television . But police in Sturgeon Bay said just seven hours after the first exchange of messages , Thomas Minar was ready to show up for sex with someone he thought was a 15-year-old boy . The criminal complaint reveals it started last Jan. 6 when someone who police say was Minar , using the profile Top4yngr4fun , contacted another person on Grindr , a social media app often used by gay males to meet others . But Minar was actually contacting police . The fake alias listed the age as 19 years old . Minar , who is 56 years old , continued chatting even after the supposed teen said he was 15 . Police said Minar asked about the teen 's first sexual experience and if he wore boxers or briefs . When he found out it was 14 and briefs , he said `` sexy , '' then asked which brand . For Luke Milner , a freshman at Franklin College , it 's a shock . `` I did n't expect him to be this kind of person , especially him being the president of the college , I would n't expect that , '' said Milner . `` It saddens me , it horrifies me , just hearing these notes . I did n't expect him to be that kind of person . '' Police said Minar sent five photos of himself wearing only underwear . When they asked him if he liked younger men , he said he did . `` Seeing them . Watching them . Thinking about them . '' He then asked if the teen was hairy and when the officer responded he did n't have much , Minar responded `` That 's so hot ... I want to see that mmmmmmm . '' They made arrangements to meet at the McDonald 's parking lot in Sturgeon Bay . Minar claimed he was not looking for sexual things and said he was a `` distinguished person '' who works in higher education . He said young gay people need resources and `` non-sexual affirmations and mentorships and role models . '' He claimed it was a fantasy chat , but then admitted he was attracted to young males . `` There 's a lot of people out there acting just like that , '' said Milner . `` I 'm glad police are doing something about it . I respect them for that . '' As we reported Monday , Minar faces three charges : child enticement , using a computer to facilitate a child sex crime and exposing a child to harmful material . The computer use charge is the most serious felony with up to 40 years in prison if convicted .

These trailblazers were serving up a visionary , singular sound back in the 1960s , but the world was n't ready for them yet . Sadly , three-fifths of the group have moved on to rock out in heaven , with this Friday marking the 12th anniversary of band member Dave Day 's death -LRB- RIP -RRB- . But for a group as under-the-radar as The Monks , their influence looms large . In fact , it 's said these cats influenced bands as disparate as the Dead Kennedys and The Beastie Boys . And later , their wacky antics paved the way for other campy heavy-hitters like The Cramps , Misfits , Gwar and Ghost . With an infectious theme song , outrageous image and cohesive brand , it 's a wonder The Monks were never catapulted to the top of the pops . Then again , a band that referred to itself as the `` anti-Beatles '' flourished working outside the system , not within it . So without any further ado , let 's dive into a crash course history lesson on one of the greatest groups that never made it . Back in 1964 , five American servicemen were stationed in Germany and formed a band called The Torquays . After they were discharged , future Monks Gary Burger -LRB- guitar , vocals -RRB- , Larry Clark -LRB- organ -RRB- , Dave Day -LRB- banjo -RRB- , Eddie Shaw -LRB- bass , trumpet , backing vocals -RRB- and Texas ' own Roger Johnston -LRB- drums -RRB- decided to stay in Europe to give the whole music thing a fair shake . An unremarkable endeavor , The Torquays played small clubs and nursing homes across Germany , regurgitating the era 's popular Beatles , Beach Boys and Kinks cuts . But The Torquays found their soul after meeting two German advertising design students , Walther Niemann and Karl-Heinz Remy . The Germans became the band 's de facto managers and gave strict orders to the five ex-GIs . Niemann and Remy had a vision , and they were steadfast in their determination to see it through . Up first : It was time to kill The Torquays . The Americans put their faith in the German design duo , although somewhat reluctantly . They traded in a guitar for a six-string banjo -LRB- aka , the glorious banjitar -RRB- , their piano for an organ and their clean sound for mammoth distortion and feedback . The Monks were born . And if they were to be called The Monks , they needed to look like monks . They traded in their long locks and cool clothes for tonsured hair and cassocks . Which , of course , was a surefire way to either confuse or piss off nearly every passerby . In fact , the band had to be in character at all times , and Niemann and Remy wrote them a set of -LRB- pretty damn poetic -RRB- commandments : `` THE RULES : FOR THE MONK In public Openly You have to be always a monk . Dressed black , hair short . Always to Always to Always to And always to Move like a monk : hard sexy strong exciting full speed dangerous But not only on the stage , But also on the street . BUT NEVER BE A TORQUAY . '' Next , The Monks work-shopped a new sound , spending innumerable hours in the studio to work on lyrics , delivery and instrumentation . Borrowing some refrains from their former band , The Monks excised their old songs of every frivolity . They 'd take a five-chord track and cut it down to two or even one . They 'd take a chorus with 25 words and whittle it down to five . They 'd strip a song of harmonies and implant crude , unison singalongs . And here we have what some have called the invention of proto-punk , and what others have dubbed the advent of garage rock . But either way , The Monks were different . And they made it OK for others to be different , too . Then , The Monks created their only album : the utterly groundbreaking Black Monk Time . And God said it was good . Cited by Rolling Stone as one of the great one-album wonders , Black Monk Time is a masterpiece . Released on Polydor in 1966 , each of its 12 songs is pure , unadulterated rock 'n' roll fun . Exhibit A : the opening track , `` Monk Time . '' It serves as The Monks ' theme song , and its frenetic energy has you headbanging right out of the gate . Here , The Monks explore the political realm with an unapologetic `` fuck you '' attitude . From the first downbeat , the organ shrieks , the banjo jangles and the caveman drums crash and thud . Then , vocalist Gary Burger explodes into earshot , screaming in his signature strained , tenor timbre . `` You know we do n't like the army / What army ? / Who cares what army ? / Why do you kill all those kids over there in Vietnam ? / Mad Viet Cong / My brother died in Vietnam ! '' But not every song on the album is an overt political statement . Specializing in making the simple spectacular , The Monks were also purveyors of the absurd and champions of the nonsensical . `` Boys Are Boys and Girls Are Choice , '' for instance , runs under a minute and a half and consists of a single stanza of lyrics . And in singles like `` I Hate You -LRB- But Call Me -RRB- '' and `` Shut Up , '' The Monks took the conventional love-obsessed rock of the '60s and turned it on its head . The 2 1/2 - minute `` Higgle-Dy - Piggle-Dy '' is another strange , but absolutely rockin ' one . It contains just the following seven words : `` Higgle-dy Piggle-dy / Way down to heaven / Yeah ! '' Whatever that means . Still , even though The Monks were wholly one-of-a-kind , they never hit it big in the States . By the time they were starting to gain traction in Germany -- especially in their main stomping ground , Hamburg -- internal tensions were festering . And in 1967 , the guys threw in the towel . Years later , though , the former Monks started attracting more renown . In the 1980s , British post-punk titans The Fall began covering a handful of Monk songs . Artists like Jack White and Iggy Pop praised Black Monk Time as essential listening . And bands like Faust , Silver Apples and Jon Spencer covered Monks songs on a 2006 tribute album , Silver Monk Time . A Monks documentary , The Transatlantic Feedback , was also released in 2006 and adeptly chronicled the band 's strange history . Harnessing that momentum , the group briefly reunited to play a smattering of shows . But they disbanded again in the mid-2000s , and this time it was for good . Yes , it 's tragic that The Monks never enjoyed the widespread success that they deserved during their heyday . But luckily for us proselytes , their music still endures . And who knows ? Maybe if we all listened to The Monks , we could even someday secure world peace . As the sagacious Burger once said : `` You 're a monk , I 'm a monk , we 're all monks ! '' Amen . Just do n't ask me to shave my head .", "url": "https://www.dallasobserver.com/music/let-us-tell-you-about-the-monks-the-anti-beatles-band-that-influenced-jack-white-and-iggy-pop-11846827", "kws": ["Monks^^songs", "Monk^^songs", "bands", "song", "British^^post-punk^^titans", "drums", "Artists", "Beastie^^Boys", "lyrics", "vocals", "God", "harmonies", "vocalist^^Gary^^Burger", "Rolling^^Stone", "Dead^^Kennedys", "proto-punk", "innumerable^^hours", "Faust", "garage^^rock", "Jack^^White"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Music": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Music_Rock": 0.9991745948791504}}}

MSCs can , however , either promote or suppress tumor growth . To address the critical question of how MSCs loaded with oncolytic viruses affect virotherapy outcomes and tumor growth patterns in a tumor microenvironment , we developed and analyzed an integrated mathematical-experimental model . We used the model to describe both the growth dynamics in our experiments of firefly luciferase-expressing Hep3B tumor xenografts and the effects of the immune response during the MSCs-based virotherapy . We further employed it to explore the conceptual clinical feasibility , particularly , in evaluating the relative significance of potential immune promotive/suppressive mechanisms induced by MSCs loaded with oncolytic viruses . We were able to delineate conditions which may significantly contribute to the success or failure of MSC-based virotherapy as well as generate new hypotheses . In fact , one of the most impactful outcomes shown by this investigation , not inferred from the experiments alone , was the initially counter-intuitive fact that using tumor-promoting MSCs as carriers is not only helpful but necessary in achieving tumor control . Considering the fact that it is still currently a controversial debate whether MSCs exert a pro- or anti-tumor action , mathematical models such as this one help to quantitatively predict the consequences of using MSCs for delivering virotherapeutic agents in vivo . Taken together , our results show that MSC-mediated systemic delivery of oncolytic viruses is a promising strategy for achieving synergistic anti-tumor efficacy with improved safety profiles . Introduction For most advanced or metastatic tumors , only a limited number of therapeutic options are available for cancer patients . Oncolytic viruses -LRB- i.e. viruses that selectively replicate and destroy cancer cells while having limited or no toxicity to normal cells -RRB- have emerged as promising novel therapeutic strategy against most advanced types of cancers . Their delivery to tumor sites , however , remains a major obstacle . When oncolytic viruses -LRB- OVs -RRB- can not be injected directly into a target tumor , only a limited fraction -LRB- usually administered intravenously -RRB- manage to migrate and reach the target tumor site . This is often due to antiviral immunity in the blood which rapidly clears the viruses1 ,2 . Clinical evidence indicates that even for high doses of intravenous OVs , the efficient systemic delivery of OVs is still limited3 ,4 . To overcome these challenges , several strategies have been explored including the use of cells that have the potential to home in towards the tumor microenvironment as delivery vehicles for OVs5 ,6 . Some carrier cells are used as Trojan horses which can internalize the OVs and allow virus replication , but have no role after successful OV delivery in tumor sites7 . In recent years , MSCs have been identified as promising vectors for the delivery of anti-cancer agents due to their strong inherent tropism into the tumor microenvironment where they not only constitute cellular components , but also regulate tumor growth8 . While within the tumor microenvironment , MSCs can interact with tumor cells in several ways which may result in the promotion of tumor growth9 ,10 . This mechanisms include suppression of local immune response11 ,12 , stimulation of the epithelial -- mesenchymal transition13 , promotion of angiogenesis10 ,14 , inhibition of tumor cell apoptosis , and promotion of tumor metastasis9 ,15 . Another important attribute of MSCs which often make them attractive candidates for OVs delivery , is that they support viral replication while loaded with the virus11 ,12,16 . MSCs are also known to protect -LRB- through internalization -RRB- the pre-loaded virus from immune-mediated neutralization during their migration to tumor sites12 ,17,18 . Building on this , recent experimental studies show that MSCs not only hide the pre-loaded OVs from immune cells during their trafficking to the tumor site , but they can also suppress the immune response11 ,12 . It is , however , not fully understood how MSCs precisely suppress the immune system11 . In contrast to their tumor promoting abilities , several studies report that MSCs can also suppress tumor growth9 ,19 . MSCs can inhibit growth of tumor cells through inhibition of angiogenesis20 , induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis21 , enhancement of inflammatory infiltration22 , and inhibition of proliferation-related signaling pathways , such as Wnt9 ,23 . Despite that , it is still not fully understood how MSCs facilitate the inhibition of tumor cell growth because no study has precisely indicated which ligand is responsible for the induction of tumor growth suppression9 . Currently , it is still controversial whether MSCs suppress or promote tumor development8 . Given the lack of information on the local interactions involved within the tumor microenvironment upon the arrival of OV carrier cells , we investigate whether using MSCs as OV carriers can significantly contribute to tumor cell death -LRB- lysis -RRB- induced by OVs upon their arrival at the tumor microenvironment . In spite of these tumor-promotive/suppressive mechanisms , multiple challenges remain to be fully addressed before MSC-based virotherapeutic approaches can be routinely applied in clinical settings . MSCs derived from different tissues in a patient can produce widely varying outcomes in relation to secretion of cytokines and chemokines , and immunomodulatory potential24 ,25,26 . Hence , it becomes difficult to predict how different patients will respond to the MSC-based cell carrier therapies25 . Currently , there is a small number of experimental-mathematical models that address the challenge of low delivery of therapeutic agents to the tumor microenvironments . Such models include use of nanoparticles27 ,28,29 and macrophages30 ,31 to deliver therapeutic drugs to tumor sites . There is , however , no mathematical model that has investigated the use of highly unpredictable mesenchymal stem cells in the presence of active immune response in oncolytic virotherapy . Thus , our modeling approach aims to bridge this gap . In an effort to better understand the current limitations of oncolytic virotherapy and how we might redesign better and successful virotherapies , it is invaluable to adopt an integrated mathematical-experimental approach . Mathematical modeling provides a theoretical framework that can be used both descriptively and predictively to explain the complexity of the tumor-immune-therapy interactions . A quantitative understanding of these interactions would help to design better and successful MSC-based virotherapies . In this contribution , we develop a mathematical model calibrated with our in vivo and in vitro experiments32 to investigate the tumor response to the use of MSCs as cellular delivery vehicles for OVs . Materials and Methods Experiments : Oncolytic adenovirus delivery by mesenchymal stem cells The study protocol was in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki . After receiving the informed consent , bone marrow was obtained from healthy donors . All the manufacturing and product testing procedures for hMSC generation were performed using good manufacturing practices -LRB- Pharmicell Co. Ltd. , Seongnam , Korea -RRB- . This research protocol was reviewed and approved by Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center , Seoul , Korea -LRB- 2015 -- 1123 -RRB- . All aspects of animal care and treatment were performed in a facility approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care . All animal studies were performed according to the institutionally approved protocols of University of Utah and Hanyang University . All mice were housed for 1 week for acclimatization , and ad libitum access to food and water was provided . The experiment for assessing MSCs as cell carriers of oncolytic Ads was carried out for both in vitro and in vivo settings as follows32 . In vivo tumor growth analysis The experimental design of using mesenchymal stem cells -LRB- MSCs -RRB- as cell carriers of oncolytic Ad and tumor growth data in response to oncolytic Ad has been reported in32 . The study evaluates the therapeutic efficacy of oAd-loaded MSCs on luciferase-expressing orthotopic Hep 3B tumors which were treated with phosphate buffered saline -LRB- PBS -RRB- , MSCs , oncolytic adenovirus -LRB- oAd -RRB- , and MSCs infected with oAd -LRB- oAd-MSCs -RRB- . The orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma cancer model was established by injecting 1 \u00d7 106 firefly luciferase-expressing Hep 3B cells into the left lobe of the liver in athymic nude mice . At 7 days post-implantation , blood was harvested by retro-orbital bleeding , and the level of AFP was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay -LRB- ELISA -RRB- according to manufacturer 's instruction . The mice were randomly divided into three groups by serum AFP level and treated with an intravenous injection of PBS , 1 \u00d7 106 MSCs , 5 \u00d7 108 virus particles -LRB- VP -RRB- of oncolytic Ad , and oAd-MSC -LRB- 1 \u00d7 106 MSCs infected with 5 \u00d7 108 VP of oncolytic Ad -RRB- on day 9 and 13 post-tumor cell implantation -LRB- n = 6 per group -RRB- . Optical imaging , with an IVIS SPECTRUM instrument , was conducted every week and luciferase activity was quantitatively analyzed with IGOR-PRO Living Image software . A group of tumor-bearing mice that were treated with PBS served as controls . Mathematical model Biological assumptions Since cell migration , or trafficking , occurs across complex multiple cellular networks , we assume , for simplicity , that MSCs have successfully homed in to the tumor sites where they can deliver their therapeutic payloads . Note that in this study , we do not consider the mechanisms that induce MSC migration to tumor sites , but we model the local interactions between MSCs loaded with oncolytic Ads -LRB- oAd-MSCs -RRB- , free oncolytic Ads within the tumor microenvironment , immune cells , and tumor cells . We also assume that the oncolytic Ads are successfully pre-loaded MSCs . Here , MSCs are not only used as Trojan horses , but as cells that can also interact with tumor cells and , possibly , promote tumor growth or induce tumor suppression . Furthermore , we assume that there are other local immune lymphocytes within the tumor microenvironment : Natural killer -LRB- NK -RRB- cells and activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes -LRB- CTLs -RRB- . While there are more than 10 types of immune cells , we included the main components of the immune system that are relevant to oncolytic virotherapy . The viral-tumor specific T cell -LRB- CTL -RRB- response contributes to the efficacy of oncolytic Ad therapy by improving tumor oncolysis and mediating a long-term anti-tumor immune response33 , while NK cells , as part of the innate immune response , are recruited and activated to clear both OVs and infected tumor cells following initial OV treatment34 . Upon their release from oAd-MSCs , for simplicity , we assume that OVs can only interact with tumor cells at the tumor site , even though it is possible that viruses can also interact with immune cells35 ,36 . Using this new integrated mathematical-experimental framework , our major goals are two-fold : -LRB- 1 -RRB- to investigate the efficacy of oAd-MSCs treatment and the immune response to tumor cells . -LRB- 2 -RRB- to compare the oAd-MSC dosing regimen -LRB- i.e. , when MSCs are used as delivery vehicles of oncolytic Ads -RRB- with the direct dose of naked oncolytic Ad regime , from a quantitative perspective . Our model builds upon the following biological assumptions : -LRB- a -RRB- in the absence of immune response and OVs , tumor growth is characterized by logistic growth dynamics ; -LRB- b -RRB- as part of the innate immunity , NK cells are always present in the tumor microenvironment , even in the absence of tumor cells , while CTLs are present only when a tumor is present ; -LRB- c -RRB- after lysis of MSCs , OVs infect tumor cells . Since not all viruses can successfully infect tumor cells , we assume that free viruses are cleared by the antiviral immune cells within the tumor microenvironment ; -LRB- d -RRB- the oAd-MSCs can only promote or suppress growth of the proliferating uninfected tumor cells since the life-span of infected cells is short -LRB- i.e. , the virus rapidly lyses the infected cell as modeled in37 -RRB- ; -LRB- d -RRB- we assume that the tumor microenvironment and cell populations are spatially homogeneous . -LRB- e -RRB- We also assume that there is no genetic variability within one cell population . It is known that tumor heterogeneity is important , but in this model , for simplicity , we assume that the model describes the average behaviour of a cell . State variables and parameters The mathematical model is based on the interaction network illustrated in Fig. 1 . The independent variable is time , t , and the state variables considered in this model are as follows : Tu -LRB- t -RRB- , the total number of uninfected tumor cells ; Ti -LRB- t -RRB- , the total number of infected tumor cells ; Mi -LRB- t -RRB- , the total number of MSC carriers in the tumor microenvironment -LRB- oAd-MSC -RRB- ; V -LRB- t -RRB- , the total number of virions released within the tumor microenvironment ; EK -LRB- t -RRB- , the total number of NK cells within the tumor microenvironment ; and EC -LRB- t -RRB- , the total number of activated CTLs within the tumor microenvironment . The model parameters , together with their units and sources , are summarized in Table S1 .

array -RCB- \\ end -LCB- array -RCB- $ $ -LRB- 9 -RRB- The functional form , D in Eq . -LRB- 7 -RRB- , represents a ratio-dependent tumor cell kill by activated CTLs , derived in38 . The parameters , \u03b1 and l , denote the maximum fractional tumor cell lysis by CTLs and a CTL strength scaling exponent , respectively . The parameter hEC in D represents the activated CTL toxicity constant that supports half maximum CTL killing rate . \u03b7 is the tentative tumor growth promotive/suppressive constant induced by oAd-MSCs . Since to our knowledge the number of tumor cells promoted/suppressed by MSCs , \u03b7 , has not been measured experimentally , we chose to focus on the overall MSC promotive/suppressive effect -LRB- \u03b4p / s\u03b7 -RRB- , where \u03b4p / s is the probability that an interaction between an MSC and a tumor cell results in promotion/suppression of tumor proliferation . In model simulations , for illustrative purposes , we use a baseline value of \u03b4p / s\u03b7 = 0.5 \u00d7 4 = 2 cells/day . Thus , to demonstrate the potential confounding mechanisms of promotion/suppression of tumor cell proliferation induced by oAd-MSCs , the simulations are run to ensure that at least 2 tumor cells are suppressed by oAd-MSC . In the case where simulations consider much larger values of \u03b7 than the assumed baseline value , such adjustments will be addressed accordingly in their respective sections . The rest of the model parameters are summarized in Table S1 . Oncolytic Ads have been shown to successfully replicate within and lyse both tumor cells and MSCs11 ,12,16 , and for this reason we assume that the cell death response function lv -LRB- MOI -RRB- is a Hill-like function of the multiplicity of infection -LRB- MOI -RRB- . Mathematically , the MOI-dependent kill rate can be formulated as follows : The parameters \\ -LRB- -LCB- h -RCB- _ -LCB- v -RCB- ^ -LCB- n -RCB- \\ -RRB- and n denote the amount of virions -LRB- virus particles -RRB- necessary to generate half-maximal cell death and the scaling exponent -LRB- coefficient -RRB- of the Hill function , respectively . The Hill-like function of the multiplicity of infection governs the lysis rate of infected cells by oncolytic Ads which , essentially , depends on MOI -LRB- see Appendix B in the SI text -RRB- . In this study , we emphasize that the higher the MOI , the higher the lysis of the infected tumor cells18 . We also emphasize that the proposed model does not take into account multiple infection . The Hill function we use in Eq . -LRB- 10 -RRB- reflects the effects of an OV on infected cells by accounting for the phenomenon where the lysis , lv , approaches the maximum value -LRB- denoted by 1 -RRB- , whenever MOI approaches higher values -LRB- i.e. , at higher virus loading -RRB- . Higher values of the exponent n > 1 increase the sensitivity of infected cells -LRB- oAd-MSCs or tumor cells -RRB- to infection of adenovirus . A complete description of the model interactions and the parameter estimates is presented in the SI text . Initial conditions and lysis Since the model was used to investigate different treatment scenarios , each scenario has a set of initial conditions . We use in vitro oAd-MSC data to inform the model parameters on cell lysis of infected MSCs . We assumed the same virus-mediated lysis for tumor cells because the results in32 illustrate a MOI -LRB- dose -RRB- - dependent killing of tumor cells . The cell lysis is , ideally , different in MSC and hepatocellular carcinoma -LRB- HCC -RRB- cells , since virus replicates more proficiently within HCC . Although we can quantify the oncolytic Ad virus particles released from the MSC as a result of virus replication-mediated cytolysis , it is generally difficult to determine how many virus particles would successfully infect tumor cells . The released virus particles within the hostile tumor microenvironment may be subjected to manifold factors that may hinder their entry into tumor cells39 . Thus , for simplicity , we assume the same virus-mediated lysis function for both oAd-MSCs and tumor cells . A detailed description of our initial conditions and the parameter estimates is presented in Appendix A in the SI text . Data fitting and parameter estimation To validate our model , we use an iterated local search-based method which consists of -LRB- a -RRB- obtaining a local minimum by means of the iterative descent algorithm and -LRB- b -RRB- randomly changing some of the model parameters and performing another iterative descent algorithm to find a better minimum . The goodness of fit is measured as the residual sum of squares -LRB- RSS -RRB- between the log of the experimental data and that of the model estimates . The variability among the measured tumor growth curves and response to oncolytic Ad , as well as the oAd-loaded MSC cell viabilities , requires a succinct explanation of data fitting and parameter estimation . We used our model described by Eqs . -LRB- 1 -- 4 -RRB- to simultaneously fit the data of Fig. 5 -LRB- B -RRB- of Yoon et al. 32 , which corresponds to treatment using oncolytic Adenovirus -LRB- oAd -RRB- and mesenchymal stem cells -LRB- MSC -RRB- alone , and a combined treatment of oAd and MSCs . The model fitting was done with the variables EK and EC set to zero because the experimental data in32 were obtained from immunodeficiency mice which do not mount any immune response to the tumor and/or virus . The experimental data were collected under the following conditions : -LRB- i -RRB- phosphate buffered saline -LRB- PBS -RRB- -LRB- used as treatment control -RRB- , -LRB- ii -RRB- mesenchymal stem cells -LRB- MSC -RRB- , -LRB- iii -RRB- oncolytic adenovirus -LRB- oAd -RRB- , -LRB- iv -RRB- MSCs infected with oAd -LRB- oAd-MSCs -RRB- . These cells/viruses were intravenously injected into tumor-bearing mice at 9 and 13 days after the tumor cell injection . Tumor growth was recorded weekly and represents the average of 1 -- 4 orthotopic tumor models . All data sets contain measurements of luciferase-expressing orthotopic Hep 3B tumor sizes indicated by bioluminescence signal intensity obtained as photons acquired per second -LRB- p/s -RRB- from regions of interest -LSB- see32 , Fig. 5 -LRB- A , B -RRB- -RSB- . We fit the submodel solutions of the system described by Eqs . -LRB- 1 -- 4 -RRB- . For comparing treatment efficacies , treated tumor growth curves -LRB- i.e. , with either oAd or oAd-MSC -RRB- were paired to PBS -LRB- regarded as control -RRB- and simultaneous fitting was performed for each pair . For the control case -LRB- PBS -RRB- , we fit the logistic submodel defined by Eq . 1 , to estimate tumor growth rate , aT , in the absence of treatment . For other tumor-virus related parameters , infection rate of tumor cells -LRB- \u03b2T -RRB- , burst sizes of infected tumor cells -LRB- bT -RRB- , and in vivo burst size of oAd-MSC -LRB- bM -RRB- , we used the corresponding treated tumor growth data to fit the corresponding submodel given by Eqs . -LRB- 1 -- 4 -RRB- . Additionally , we estimate the cell death rate -LRB- lysis rate -RRB- of infected cells using Eq . 9 for a specific MOI and retained this estimate for subsequent model simulations . To further understand the cell viability of oAd-loaded MSCs for all MOIs , we used an appropriate exponential response function -LRB- See Supplementary Fig . S6 in the SI text -RRB- . Results Model validation and parameter estimation First , we fit the data corresponding to treatment case -LRB- i -RRB- with PBS alone . In this case , we used a model that excludes the virus infection and induced tumor/virus specific immune responses . We obtained aT = 0.315 / day and retained this estimated value for all subsequent model simulations . For other remaining tumor-virus related parameters , we sequentially and hierarchically fitted the model parameters to appropriate data sets and obtained the estimates in Table 1 in the SI text . The example plot of both untreated and treated tumor growth data and model solutions fitted to the oAd-MSC treated mice with the measured tumor load Tu -LRB- t -RRB- + Ti -LRB- t -RRB- is shown in Fig. 2 . In Fig. 2 we show representative plots of the model fits to experimental data in32 . Since in the data it was difficult to determine which cell is infected , the total tumor size -LRB- Tu -LRB- t -RRB- + Ti -LRB- t -RRB- -RRB- was measured and the model fitted to the data . The significant reduction of tumor size can clearly be observed by tracking the infected tumor cell population -LRB- Fig. 2 -LRB- B , D -RRB- -RRB- . We note that in the presence of the oAd-MSC , tumor growth is invariably slowed down compared to either oAd treatment or the control case -LRB- PBS -RRB- at 35 days post tumor implantation , as expected . Consequently , the survival of the oAd-MSC treated mice improves with therapy . Predictions and insights from the mathematical model To better understand the interaction mechanisms of oAd-MSCs in the tumor microenvironment and the effect of MSC-based treatment , we used our new mathematical model to simulate the response of tumor cells to oAd-MSCs . We used our model to provide insights on the optimal use of MSC-based therapeutic strategies for maintaining a lower tumor burden . The model simulations were based on the following schedule : -LRB- 1 -RRB- We first identify the key model parameter using global sensitivity analysis . -LRB- 2 -RRB- We simulate the long-term behavior of the model in the absence of therapy -LRB- i.e. , without the oAd-MSC treatment and the immune response to tumor cells -RRB- . -LRB- 3 -RRB- We then use the computational model to explore various critical properties of MSCs and oncolytic viruses . -LRB- 4 -RRB- Finally , we perform an in silico therapy to capture the dynamics between the tumor cells , oAd-MSCs , virus populations released from oAd-MSCs and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment . However , due to lack of appropriate data evaluating the tumor promotion or suppression by oAd-MSCs , our mathematical model only presents a conceptual study illustrating the dynamic consequences of local interactions of the tumor-oAd-MSC-immune ecosystem within the tumor microenvironment . Hence , we should be cautious in making certain statements about specific oAd-MSC treatment responses , and any simulation should be interpreted as one possibility , and not as an inevitable treatment outcome in any given case . However , a large number of model simulations , along with model sensitivity analysis of parameter fluctuations , can certainly provide a general overview of possible cell-virus dynamics under certain conditions . Further investigations into these mechanisms may generate new insights into the nature of the tumor-oAd-MSC-immune system interactions , as well as effective treatment regimes in oncolytic virotherapy . Next , we highlight four key outcomes from our model simulations . The multiplicity of infection is a key player in tumor reduction and its higher value leads to better treatment outcomes We first took a more holistic view of the parameter space by performing a global sensitivity analysis using both Pearson Rank Correlation Coefficients -LRB- PRCC -RRB- and the extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Testing -LRB- eFAST -RRB- . Our sensitivity analysis -LRB- see Identification of key model parameters section in SI text -RRB- reveals that there is a variability in parameters that influence tumor size at different time points corresponding to early and later stages of tumor growth . Under PRCC , the model system is found to be most sensitive to the multiplicity of infection -LRB- MOI -RRB- -LRB- see Fig . S1 in SI text -RRB- as well as to the half-saturation constant that supports half maximum killing of infected cells by the oncolytic virus . Most intriguingly , these parameters can easily be estimated from the experimental data . Furthermore , the eFAST results -LRB- see Fig . S2 in SI text -RRB- , indicate that MOI is the most significant parameter affecting the early stages of tumor growth , while the virus clearance and the rate of CTL recruitment are most significant at latter time points . The qualitative results of our global sensitivity analysis show that the MOI is a key driver of tumor reduction . To further investigate this interesting result and to determine how loading MSCs with different MOI impacts the tumor lysis , we simulated different therapeutic profiles of tumor cell growth by varying MOI values as used in the oAd-MSC as described in our experiments . The resulting relative contributions of each MOI to tumor oncolysis are shown in Fig . S5 in SI text . We note that lower loading of oncolytic Ads on MSCs does not lead to a decrease in the tumor size , instead the tumor growth is worsened by MSCs , indicating a treatment failure . On the other hand , at higher loading , we notice that not only the tumor is reduced to a small size , but is also rapidly debulked to a small size with the second dose of oAd-MSCs . More importantly , the tumor is kept at small size for longer therapeutic time window . Using this information , we can conclude that loading MSCs at various MOIs , within tolerable toxicities , may improve our current understanding of the therapy adjustments indispensable for successful oAd-MSC based treatment outcomes . Our sensitivity analysis has significant impacts from both the mathematical and clinical research viewpoints . From the clinical perspective , the sensitivity analysis results suggest that , based on the variations of MOI , tumor cells can be more effectively controlled during the early growth phases -LRB- i.e. , the oAd-MSC therapy is more likely to be successful during early tumor evolution -RRB- , while at latter growth phases , the tumor is more likely to escape the therapy -LRB- i.e. , failure of oAd-MSC therapy is more likely to occur during latter tumor growth phases -RRB- . This could be due , partly , to high free virus clearance by the anti-virus immune cells -LRB- note that the virus clearance is statistically significant at days 70 and 200 - see Fig . S2 in SI text -RRB- . This particular result is consistent with other models which highlight that increasing virus clearance leads to a larger tumor burden40 . Taken together , these results elucidate how cell death , which depends on the multiplicity of infection according to this model , can affect clinical outcome . Thus , our sensitivity analysis highlights how parameter space screening to assess the cell death by oncolytic viruses can be useful in designing new oncolytic vectors for MSC-based treatments . Anti-tumoral effect of oAd-MSC based therapy depends on their tumor promotive or suppressive action Considering the fact that it is still currently a contentious debate whether MSCs exert a pro- or anti-tumor action8 , numerical simulations such as the those conducted herein may aid to objectively predict the consequences of using MSCs for delivering oncolytic Ads in vivo . It is known that MSC-based therapies can produce varying outcomes in relation to secretion of cytokines and chemokines , and immunomodulatory potential24 ,25,26 , making it difficult to predict how an individual patient may respond to MSC-cell based oncolytic virotherapy25 . Our sensitivity analysis -LRB- see Fig . S1 in SI text -RRB- indicates that the model is sensitive to immune related parameters at latter times of tumor growth . At the latter growth stages , tumors often express different tumor antigens which are recognized by immune cells , and if on the other hand , the tumor can downregulate , modify or abrogate expression of these antigens , then it may find a way to avoid immune recognition . Our sensitivity analysis results further illustrate that the immune response may not be capable of controlling early tumor growth . This result is also confirmed by the simulations in Fig . S3 in SI text which show how a tumor evolves over time in the presence of the immune response . We therefore , herein examine the impact of oAd-MSCs on tumor growth when there is no immune response . To further investigate the anti-tumoral effect of using oAd-MSCs , we use our mathematical framework to simulate three different treatment protocols when : -LRB- a -RRB- oAd-MSCs do not have any effect on tumor growth ; -LRB- b -RRB- oAd-MSCs promote tumor growth ; and -LRB- c -RRB- oAd-MSCs suppress tumor growth . -LRB- a -RRB- oAd-MSCs that do not have any effect on tumor growth offer moderate treatment outcomes The simulation results , presented in Fig. 3 -LRB- A -RRB- , show that the oAd-MSC treatment exhibits potent killing effects , with cell killing of 99.3 % for tumor cells on day 35 suggesting that using oAd-MSCs that have no effect on tumor cell growth can still yield a favourable treatment outcome . We note , compared to cases -LRB- B -RRB- and -LRB- C -RRB- , that oAd-MSCs that do not have any effect on tumor growth offer better treatment outcomes than oAd-MSCs that suppress tumor growth -LRB- case C -RRB- . -LRB- b -RRB- oAd-MSCs that promote tumor cell proliferation elicits highly effective anti-tumor responses The results in Fig. 3 -LRB- B -RRB- indicate that administering oAd-MSCs that promote tumor proliferation -LRB- i.e. , prior to their lysis by oncolytic virions -RRB- effectively exhibited the greatest killing effects , with cell killing of 99.8 % for tumor cells on day 35 . From both the modeling and clinical perspectives , this result shows that using oAd-MSCs which promote tumor proliferation exhibits higher tumor killing effects is very intriguing , and initially counter-intuitive . Despite the fact that MSCs promote the growth of tumors , infected MSCs -LRB- i.e. , infected with the replicating virus , such as oncolytic Ad -RRB- , typically die within 5 days from virus infection41 . Promising as this observation is , future experimental research is warranted to justify this observation . Results in Fig. 3 -LRB- B -RRB- , however , confirm the findings in the experiment that using oAd-MSCs results in effective tumor killing compared to anti-tumor effects of naked oncolytic Ads -LRB- see also Table S2 in SI text -RRB- . Our numerical results are comparable to the findings in18 which demonstrated that there was a decrease in tumor burden in mice treated with oncolytic Ad delivered by MSC carriers compared with the direct injection of the oncolytic Ad . -LRB- c -RRB- oAd-MSCs that suppress tumor growth exhibit a lower tumor killing effect Finally , we simulated the scenario where the oAd-MSCs exert a suppressive effect on tumor cell growth . Results are depicted in Fig. 3 -LRB- C -RRB- . We note that increasing the absolute value of tumor growth promotion/suppression constant in the model only increases the promotive/suppressive effect of oAd-MSC on tumor proliferation , but the model qualitatively demonstrated similar results under the three scenarios considered in this study -LRB- see Fig . S4 in SI text -RRB- . > From Fig. 3 -LRB- C -RRB- , we see that if the oAd-MSCs exert some suppressive effect on tumor cell growth , the treatment is significantly less effective than anticipated . Taken together , we conclude that using oAd-MSCs that promote tumor proliferation may provide a significant advantage in tumor cell reduction , though the therapeutic benefit of such oAd-MSCs may be limited if the oncolytic viruses do not successfully infect all tumor cells . Based on these results , if the goal of the therapy is to target long-term tumor control , using oAd-MSCs that have promotive effects on tumor growth offer better treatment outcomes . These results demonstrate that systemic delivery of oncolytic Ad by MSCs may provide a powerful alternative therapy to naked oncolytic Ad . As demonstrated by the simulations , we infer that , because the infected MSCs effectively delivered oncolytic Ads to the tumor site in experiments and in18 , oAd-MSC based therapy surmounts the limited clinical applicability of system administration of oncolytic Ads and provides effective treatment to inaccessible tumors . In silico simulations of oAd-MSC based therapeutic dynamics Given the above observations , we further used our mathematical model to perform in silico simulations of oAd-MSC dynamics under two scenarios : High initial oAd-MSC inoculum and comparison of oAd-MSC with direct oAd therapies . The simulation results we present here are purely hypothetical and require further investigations of this tumor treatment . Eventhough the simulation results are interpreted in the context of hypothetical clinical patient outcomes , the simulation settings align with the in vivo experiment in32 , to mimic oAd-MSC based treatment regimes . Increasing oAd-MSCs inoculum leads to a faster reduction of tumor burden To investigate the dose-dependency of the initial oAd-MSC inoculum , we simulated the same three treatment scenarios discussed above with an increased value of 1 \u00d7 108 oAd-MSCs , under the same MOI of 10 . While the initial oAd-MSC inoculum can be manipulated in clinical settings , we are predominantly interested in the dynamic interactions that can be observed in the human clinical setting , though it is conceivable that mouse experiments may emulate clinical settings . In any case , the initial oAd-MSC inoculum injected into patients would be higher than those considered in animal models24 . Note that in our simulations here , we used the same number of oncolytic Ads -LRB- 5 \u00d7 108 viral particles -LRB- VP -RRB- -RRB- as described in our experiments above , and increased number of MSCs -LRB- 1 \u00d7 108 cells -RRB- , generating MOI of 5 , which is still within the clinical ranges reported in24 . The results of this adjustment are shown in Fig. 4 . From Fig. 4 -LRB- A -RRB- , we see that the second dosage at day 13 of oAd-MSCs is able to drastically reduce the tumor size by 99.84 % compared to what is in Fig. 3 -LRB- A -RRB- . It is interesting to note that although the oAd-MSCs injected do not impact a tumor in anyway , the progeny of oncolytic Ads released from oAd-MSCs is able to effectively reduce tumor to small sizes . Again , comparing Figs. 3 -LRB- B -RRB- and 4 -LRB- B -RRB- , where oAd-MSCs promote tumor proliferation , we observe that the high dosage of oAd-MSCs is able to greatly reduce the tumor by approximately 99.87 % . Finally , we also observe an enhanced tumor killing of approximately 100 % in Fig. 4 -LRB- C -RRB- compared to 99.9 % in Fig. 3 -LRB- C -RRB- . For clinical applicability we adapted a high infusion of 1 \u00d7 108 oAd-MSCs -LRB- which is less than 3.0 \u00d7 108 cells -LRB- clinical dose -RRB- 41 -RRB- , and we noted that in Fig. 4 , the second oAd-MSC dosage is capable of rapidly reducing tumors to small sizes compared to Fig. 3 . This implies that tumors could be held in a small controllable state by the presence of oAd-MSCs , within the tumor microenvironment , which would ultimately produce a second progeny of Ads that can propagate and infect more tumor cells . oAd-MSC therapy provides better therapeutic outcomes compared to direct oncolytic Ad therapy Despite a growing need for the best therapeutic options , clinical goals are now turning towards optimization of long-term control of cancer , rather than a complete cure . Mathematical models are useful tools for enhancing our understanding of the optimal therapeutic options . In this regard , we chose to test the merit of oAd-MSC regimens by comparing them with direct intravenous injection of naked oncolytic Ads . In particular , we were interested in finding which therapy regimen leads to rapid tumor reduction . We assume that a treatment regimen that reduces a total tumor cell population rapidly , within the therapeutic window of 35 days as in the experiments herein , will offer a greater tumor control , minimize time to tumor relapse , and provide a better prognosis . In order to compare the significance of each therapy , dependent on the influx terms -LRB- described in model Eqs . -LRB- 3 -RRB- and -LRB- 4 -RRB- which have switch boolean constants -LRB- \u03beM and \u03beV -RRB- defined in Eq . -LRB- 9 -RRB- in SI text -RRB- , we held one term constant and vary the other according to the following therapy schedules : -LRB- 1 -RRB- no therapy ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- direct injection of naked oncolytic Ads only ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- injection of oAd-MSCs . Note also that these treatment schedules are simulated in consideration of whether oAd-MSCs promote or suppress tumor cell proliferation and for different probabilities of tumor growth promotion/suppression by oAd-MSCs . The results are shown in Fig. 5 . In Fig. 5 S2 in SI text -RRB- , we note that when oAd-MSCs have a smaller likelihood of promoting or suppressing tumor cell growth , the oAd-MSC based regimen yields a relatively similar treatment outcome to direct dose of naked oncolytic Ads . Most importantly , when oAd-MSCs have a higher likelihood of suppressing tumor cell proliferation , our results -LRB- Fig. 5 -LRB- F -RRB- -RRB- indicate that the oAd-MSC therapy outperforms the direct dose of naked oncolytic Ad therapy . In general , this result indicates that the oAd-MSC treatment is not only more effective at controlling tumor burden , but also reduces tumor size rapidly , suggesting that the oAd-MSC treatment has important therapeutic outcomes over the therapy with naked oncolytic Ads . In summary , the simulations conducted in this study shed light on different plausible treatment outcomes which may arise when using MSCs as cellular vehicles of oncolytic viruses . Importantly , though the above simulations were done under hypothetical clinical settings , the simulation results are qualitatively comparable to the clinical results in42 . For example , in42 a complete clinical response was observed in four children when MSCs were used as cellular carriers of oncolytic virus , and one of the four children was reported to have complete remission 3 years after MSC-based oncolytic virotherapy . Taken together , our computational framework described herein may serve as a basic platform which can help to objectively assess the contribution of oAd-MSC based dynamics to clinical outcomes , as it is often difficult to predict how individual patients may respond to the MSC-based carrier therapies25 . Discussion and Conclusion In this paper , we devised a new mathematical model calibrated with a set of experimental data , including data from our own in vitro and in vivo experiments32 , for the delivery of oncolytic Ads by MSCs . Even though mathematical models that describe the use of cells as carriers of therapeutic agents to tumor sites have been proposed in the literature -LRB- see for example30 ,31 -RRB- , no model has described the dynamics of tumor growth under MSC-based oncolytic virotherapy . Our quantitative framework is the first of its kind in that it not only describes the local interactions of tumor cells with oncolytic viruses and immune cells , but also incorporates the impact of MSC promotive/suppressive actions on tumor growth dynamics . We quantified how model parameters influence tumor growth dynamics with global sensitivity analysis of the parameter space . The analysis revealed that the lysis rate of infected cells , which depends on the multiplicity of infection -LRB- MOI -RRB- , is the most influential parameter . In particular , low variation in MOI suggests that the oncolytic Ads have a great potential of destroying tumor cells at all time points . This is qualitatively affirmed by the model simulations , especially in Fig. 4 . In our fitting , we kept the multiplicity of infection -LRB- MOI = 5 -RRB- constant because the MOI of 5 led to the optimal condition for viral production in32 . However , comparison of lysis rates for tumors treated with direct oAd with those treated with oAd-MSC suggests that the initial viral dose is an important variable and a key determinant of successful therapy . While higher initial viral dose may favor treatment with direct oncolytic virus , higher virus inoculum may critically induce premature MSC lysis -LRB- due to adenovirus replication -RRB- , leading to decreased overall efficacy of oAd-MSC therapy32 . We performed a global sensitivity analysis of the parameter space and model simulations with the current model and noticed that this is true . Experimental evidence from various tumor models with oAd support this conclusion11 ,32,43 . Based on this understanding , it seems that oAd-MSCs can significantly enhance oncolytic virotherapy . This may , at least in part , offer reasonable justification for why the use of MSCs as cellular vehicles of OVs appears to be the most attractive therapy in anti-tumor strategies . Altogether , our PRCC and eFAST results reveal that the lysis rate of infected cells is related to the enhanced oAd-MSC treatment efficacy , consistent with the experimental findings in16 ,17 . We should emphasize that variation in lysis rate of infected cells could be more accurately quantified given the availability of relevant patient-specific data , and the efficacy of oAd-MSCs as cellular vehicles is more likely to influence clinical outcomes . Therefore , quantifying MOI variations could provide a significant impact on the design of future oAd-MSC based therapies that target tumor cell proliferation . We further used the model to investigate how systemic administration of oAd-MSC influences the treatment outcomes compared to direct administration of naked oncolytic Ads . In particular , we were predominantly interested in finding out how the dynamic interactions between oAd-MSCs and tumor cells impact the therapeutic outcome , under the notion that the Ad-MSCs may promote/suppress tumor proliferation . Given the low infusion of oAd-MSCs -LRB- Fig. 3 -LRB- B -RRB- -RRB- , we note that , though the tumor is effectively reduced , there is still a large number of uninfected tumor cells at the end of the experimental therapeutic window of 35 days . This offers a slight improvement compared to the case where oAd-MSC have no influence on tumor growth -LRB- Fig. 3 -LRB- A -RRB- -RRB- . If , on the other hand , the oncolytic Ads can not successfully infect a large portion of tumor cells , then this result suggests that oAd-MSCs could allow tumors to escape therapeutic control . This is in line with anti-tumoral studies indicating that MSCs promote tumor progression and metastasis in animal models8 ,44 . We alternatively simulated the scenario where oAd-MSCs suppress tumor growth -LRB- Fig. 3 -LRB- C -RRB- -RRB- , under low infusion of oAd-MSCs . We observed that the tumor is not greatly reduced as anticipated , compared to the previous scenario indicated in Fig. 3 -LRB- B -RRB- . This scenario is , however , still comparatively better than the case where oAd-MSCs exert no effect on tumor growth -LRB- Fig. 3 -LRB- A -RRB- -RRB- . This result suggests , at least from the clinical safety control perspective , that using oAd-MSCs that suppress tumor growth could still offer improved anti-tumor treatment outcomes . It is important to note that our model captures dynamical behaviour across a range of treatment scenarios -LRB- three scenarios considered here -RRB- . While each scenario is described by a specific choice of parameters , there is an intriguing underlying behaviour common to all scenarios . In particular , our model simulations explicitly display exponential tumor growth , indicating unbounded early tumor growth dynamics , and population regression following the administration of oAd-MSC therapy , suggesting the feasibility and efficacy of using oAd-MSCs . In general , our results indicate that oAd-MSCs are capable of interacting with tumor cells in various ways which consequently lead to a reduced tumor cell population , consistent with both experimental and clinical studies18 ,24,42 . We also compared the therapeutic outcomes of injecting high oAd-MSC inoculum -LRB- emulating clinical settings , similar to settings in24 -RRB- to low dosage of oAd-MSC -LRB- emulating sub-clinical or experimental animal settings -RRB- on tumor reduction . The results of high infusion of 1 \u00d7 108 oAd-MSCs are shown in Fig. 4 , while results of injecting a small dose of 1 \u00d7 106 oAd-MSCs are indicated in Fig. 3 . Investigation of tumor reduction revealed that high injection of oAd-MSCs causes , not only a faster reduction in tumor burden , but a massive reduction of the tumor under all three treatment scenarios . These results show a dose-dependent increase in tumor killing efficacy of oAd-MSC therapy , indicating that oncolytic Ads -LRB- delivered by MSCs -RRB- are capable of replicating efficiently and inducing tumor cell death . Based on this understanding , we conclude that treatment with high infusion of oAd-MSCs provides a more useful tool compared with treatment with low injection of oAd-MSCs , consistent with the findings in24 . It is crucial to note that even though we simulated therapeutic scenarios with high injection of oAd-MSCs , the cell viability of MSC post-infection decreases rapidly as shown in17 , in particular , infected MSCs typically die within 5 days from virus infection as confirmed in41 . Having confirmed that the initial inoculum of oAd-MSCs plays a critical role in tumor control , we were interested in modeling how the MOI-dependency of oAd-MSC impacts treatment outcome . We showed that low MOIs may lead to treatment failure , while higher values of MOIs yield better results than previously thought , with tumor significantly reduced and maintained in small sizes -LRB- see Fig. 4 -RRB- . As demonstrated above , this finding highlights the need to find the right balance between the number of oAd-MSCs injected and the amount of oncolytic virions loaded on the MSCs for long term tumor control with OVs . The appropriate MOI adjustments can help determine the tumor size outcome with , possibly , a tumor-free state at the end of therapy . When comparing the therapeutic benefits of using oAd-MSC therapy to direct intravenous dose of naked oncolytic Ads , our simulation results -LRB- Fig. 5 -RRB- point out that the oAd-MSC therapy offers qualitatively similar , but slightly better , prognosis with respect to rapid reduction of tumor cells , than the naked oncolytic Ad therapy . Thus , our results highlight an essential subtlety that can further be tested in future clinical trials focused on this comparison . Our computational analysis provides new important insights into the properties of MSCs when used as cellular vehicles for delivering oncolytic Ads to the tumor microenvironment . Understanding the dynamics of how tumors respond to oAd-MSC therapies can inform oncolytic virotherapy schedules and can provide basic guidelines for optimizing treatment response . Even though the results of this study are novel and promising , several limitations exist in the current modeling framework . With respect to the lysis term proposed here , model predictions may change as a function of multiplicity of infection -LRB- MOI -RRB- and the Hill coefficient -LRB- n -RRB- , as confirmed by global sensitivity analysis results in Figs . S2 and S3 . Even with these limitations , the lysis term proposed in this modeling approach allowed for the prediction of tumor response to oncolytic Ads delivered by MSCs , as observed in the oAd-MSC experiments we carried out . While no violation of model assumptions is observed , it is inherently difficult to test whether the antiviral immune response and anti-tumor immune response in the model are independently induced by OVs , as the experimental data in our study were derived from human xenograft tumor-bearing immunodeficient mice . Thus , it should be noted that the model predictions can not be applied directly to the human clinical setting , and there is a need for robust model calibration and validation as appropriate data become available . Most of the parameters pertaining to the interaction of tumor cells , immune cells , and OVs used in the current model were obtained from previous models , which fitted models to experimental data from immunodeficient mice , due to lack equivalent data for human patients . We , therefore , emphasize that parameter re-evaluation is certainly warranted in future to perform rigorous model validation . While also conceivable that model predictions may vary , the fundamental concepts relating to tumor growth promotion/suppression induced by MSCs are robust to parameter choice , and qualitatively similar results are expected to be observed . Importantly , optimization of the oAd-MSC dosing regimens and incorporation of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic terms describing the release of cytokines/chemokines by MSCs to promote/suppress tumor growth would be an attractive further extension of the current model.The presence of tumor growth promotive/suppressive cytokines/chemokines within the tumor microenvironment could strongly influence the outcome of the local interactions of tumor cells with oAd-MSCs , immune cells , and OVs . In conclusion , this study illustrates different tumor responses which are difficult to explain from the experimental results alone . Specifically , this model provides a new theoretical approach for predicting tumor changes in response to oncolytic Ads in vivo delivered by MSCs . Despite the inherent simplifying assumptions in the proposed model , our computational approach may serve as a basic platform for further refinement of mathematical models that describe tumor responses to cell-based virotherapies . Our model may , at least in part , offer justification to why oAd-MSCs should be used with great caution under clinical settings . Most importantly , our results highlight that oAd-MSCs provide a feasible synergism of oncolytic virotherapy when used as cellular delivery vehicles . Currently , clinical trials using MSCs as cellular vehicles for delivering OVs are under way and our mathematical framework adds new valuable information which may help to determine how MSCs may actually translate into meaningful clinical outcomes . Taken together , the findings in the present paper suggest oAd-MSC therapy as a promising therapeutic candidate for delivering oncolytic Ads for future clinical trials against aggressive and inaccessible tumors .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrLGjmD", "title": "`` Hey , Jones ! '' : Another PSU lawsuit , Monday night CFP loot , how LSU wideouts scoot , why OSU ref calls are moot", "content": "Penn State superfans : Get exclusive , in-depth Nittany Lions news , analysis and recruiting updates every day . Become a PennLive Football Insider . Only $ 5.99 a month . Learn more . I took a few days off around the holidays , so it 's a particularly full mailbag . No need to dally . Let 's get to it ! This , from Geno Crosby : First we have the Lynch lawsuit and then the Humphries lawsuit is the follow up act . The University is clearly going to defend how this was handled , by prior public statements . Can we be sure we do n't fall on our face again ? We have no going back now if any of these allegations prove to be true . I do n't think either the Lynch case or the Humphries case can be judged until we see more , if indeed there is more to see . I agree , from the university 's public stance , it appears there will be no capitulation . But I 'm not about to try to game whether PSU has all its I 's dotted and T 's crossed . Sandy Barbour and the school lawyers seem to think they have . It 's also interesting that the same PSU-grad Philadelphia lawyer filed both suits within a space of four months . This , from Lonn Lebo : Is Sean Clifford or any QB on the roster good enough to get Penn State to a playoff ? The QBs of the top four teams are always elite . I hear you and I understand what you 're saying . Joe Burrow , Trevor Lawrence , Jalen Hurts and Justin Fields was quite a quartet this season . And that is commonly , though not always , the sort of playmakers the final four has deployed at quarterback . But I think Clifford was good enough to get Penn State to the CFP this season if he had a better complement of wideouts . He had K.J. Hamler and a bunch of guys . Consider this : If the Nits make one more play at Minnesota , they finish 11-1 with a very respectable 11-point loss in Columbus . You think that does n't get them in the Playoff ? And was Sean Clifford the real issue in that game ? I do n't think so . Along those same lines , this from Ryan Morrison : I thought Penn State had speed offensively and could compete at the highest level . After watching that speed and athleticism Monday night , PSU still has a long way to go . Those WRs were studs . Your thoughts ? I 'm with you . Did you see the squadron Louisiana State ran out there ? Nobody in the Big Ten other than Minnesota is even in their remote vicinity . Other than Ja'Marr Chase 's botch in the end zone of Burrow 's bucket-drop to him , I ca n't remember another missed catch . He and Justin Jefferson and Terrace Marshall went and got everything Burrow threw , as they 've been doing all year . That 's a large reason he had 60 TD passes . Big receivers who adjust to throws in the air and then go up and get them are what Penn State lacks . That 's what it 's missed the last two seasons -- WRs who consistently run good routes , get separation and adjust to balls that are n't perfectly thrown . And we have n't even gotten into the semi-chronic offensive line issues . Now , Penn State will have its fourth new receivers coach in four seasons and lots of questions about who exactly will be dependable , let alone special , among a depleted group . They 're again missing the big-strong-stallion WR like Chris Godwin . The last two would-bes did n't develop and transferred out -LRB- Juwan Johnson and Justin Shorter -RRB- . And they whiffed on Julian Fleming . I do n't know if you caught any of the Under Armour game , but -- wow . You win big with great receivers these days . Look what Minnesota did in just a year with Rashod Bateman and Chris Autman-Bell joining Tyler Johnson . Auburn could n't handle them . I would 've loved seeing that group against Ohio State 's great corners in the B1G championship , but alas ... This , from Geoff Quillen : Who can I call about those TWO terrible calls in the Ohio State game ? Not me . The targeting call was absolutely the right one . You ca n't lead with the crown of your helmet . Does n't matter if the ballcarrier ducks his head . The scoop-n-score I never thought was a catch live . When they slowed it down , Herbie and Fowler talked me into it for a minute . Then Bill Lemonnier talked me out of it before the overturn . I thought it could 've gone either way . Anyway , Ohio State still wins if it does n't piss away all those points -LRB- 12 -RRB- in the first half . Or if Chris Olave does n't break off his route and sticks with his slant . Or if the OSU defense stops Clemson on its final TD drive . The Tigers won , fair and square . And you notice , in their loss to Louisiana State , they had their best defender removed in the third quarter for the same targeting enforcement . The rule is a good one , it 's necessary , and people need to understand it and get used to it . This , from Jay Rotz : The question that has been floating around the office this morning : Who has the greater NFL upside : Lawrence or Burrow ? Including mine , that 's three colons in one sentence . Never would 've cleared the desk in the old days . I 'm honestly not nuts about either one . I love Lawrence 's arm and stature . He 's damn hard to tackle , let alone hurt . But I did n't much like those 12 or 13 overthrows against LSU . I 'm not certain about his demeanor . And cut that damn hair ! I love Burrow 's accuracy and temperament . He throws a gorgeous deep ball with touch . But his build is a little spindly and it 's hard to tell how much of his success is due to the machine he got to drive this year . He had the college game 's hot young QB coach -LRB- just hired by the Panthers -RRB- helping to run a fully-equipped offense with an improved offensive line . I think both need to be fortunate enough to land with decent organizations who trade up or it could be a bumpy ride for either one . This , from Sam Gruber : I hated to see players celebrate after every play . Heck , you do n't even need officials to call first downs anymore ; the player signals the first down . In college basketball , anything that resembles baiting can result in a T. Is my age showing ? That and the fact you were a hard-ass ref . :D . Look , I 'm weary of it , too . But it does n't really bother me . What I will never get accustomed to is fabricated stadium noise . That 's my old-man trigger and I despise it . It 's for pro indoor soccer and various trashsports . Not college football and basketball . But the marketing dopes who 've overrun `` revenue sports '' have become the new normal . And finally , this , from Andy Sandrik : College football has been played on Saturday all season . Why is the championship game being held on a Monday night and running past midnight ? It 's money , right ? Well , you knew that . But the analytics are about a cable network -LRB- ESPN -RRB- holding the contract and Monday night drawing in the entire country from coast to coast -LRB- 5:20 PST at dinnertime on the West Coast to 8:20 EST and a little too late but tolerable along the Atlantic -RRB- . Future dates and times are similarly mapped out through the rest of the contract ending in 2025 . It ai n't changing until 2026 at the earliest . If an 8-team playoff structure is adopted , I could see the schedule laid out any number of ways . But in order to dodge the NFL playoffs , you 'd either need to hold the championship game on a weeknight or the semis . There 's no way around it . The NFL is 900-pound gorilla of TV ratings and you 're not moving its divisional playoffs off Saturdays in January . Ai n't happening . As for another week later for the CFP championship -LRB- say the third Saturday in January -RRB- , the presidents of the Power Five have already been leery of extending the season that late into winter term . They do n't like it . Then again , with final exams the second week of December and the new early signing period the third week , I do n't see that they have any choice . Another round of playoffs might have to start the fourth week . So , you 'd have the CFP quarterfinals the Saturday after Christmas , the semis on a weeknight in January and the championship maybe the third Saturday in January -- the day before the NFL conference championships games . Any way you slice it , the colleges must use weeknights at some point in the tournament to avoid conflicting with the NFL . And Friday night is a non-starter because it 's a date night with too many people out of their homes . Traditionally , a lousy ratings night for sports or any other programming . So , get used to a work night . It sucks having to stay up so late in the East . But the rest of the country watches football , too . FREE Nittany Lions news !

From `` The Rime of the Ancient Mariner '' It 's that time of year again ! February is just around the bend and with it comes The Big Read , a program the National Endowment for the Arts -LRB- NEA -RRB- created to broaden understanding of our world , our communities and ourselves through the joy of sharing a good book . This is the 13th time Coastal Georgia has been lucky enough to participate . That 's right : 13th ! Under the outstanding leadership of Heather Heath , executive director of Golden Isles Arts & Humanities , who writes the grant to bring us The Big Read -- anyone and everyone is invited to read ` In the Heart of the Sea ' by Nathaniel Philbrick . A New York Times bestseller and winner of the National Book Award in 2000 , this book has been said to rank as one of the most incredible survival stories of all time . The author combines excellent storytelling skills with meticulous research bringing to life the astonishing true adventure of the crew of the 19th century whale ship Essex , which sank after being destroyed by a furious bull whale . The story of the disaster was the inspiration for Herman Melville 's classic , `` Moby Dick . '' The Essex , with 20 men aboard , left Nantucket on its last whaling voyage in 1819 . This was the captain 's first time in command and most of the crew were `` greenhorns , '' new to whaling . On top of this , they were heading into unfamiliar territory in the central Pacific . On Nov. 20 , 1820 , some 1,500 miles west of the Galapagos Islands and 40 miles south of the Equator , the ship , according to the records provided by members of the crew , was `` stove by a whale . '' An enormous 80-ton sperm whale in a pod under attack by the whalers fought back , striking first the port side and then the bow of the Essex . It wrecked the boat , and after completing what the first mate called `` decided , calculated mischief , '' the whale swam away never to reappear . The ship went down and , in the short but lucrative history of whaling , this was apparently an extremely rare event . For the next 90 days the men were adrift in three small open boats . There was little to no wind to fill the makeshift sails and one day , an orca , or killer whale , slammed into one of the boats . Sharks loitered near the boats and for a terrifying period , the men drifted , helpless , among a pod of the same immense whales that had once provided them with a living . The whalers had close to nothing : a few navigational instruments , little food and fresh water . They endured fierce storms and tried to live on morsels of bread that were harder than rocks . Their skin became fried and covered in sores . Some of the men starved to death or went mad from dehydration ; there was cannibalism and some offered to die to feed those who might live . Against all odds eight men lived and were rescued by passing ships . Some survivors even returned to the whaling life , a choice that seems incomprehensible after reading this gruesome -- yet fascinating -- account . Philbrick , a historian and the author of books on sailing , grew up hearing the story of the Essex . As an adult , he moved to Nantucket in the mid-80s and lives there still . For this book he relied on two first-hand accounts of the voyage : one published by the first mate , Owen Chase , in 1821 , and the other from the unpublished diary of the 14-year-old cabin boy , Thomas Nickerson , discovered in an attic about 1960 . Their accounts bring to life the horrors of starvation and dehydration ; and the courage and unconquerable spirits of the sailors as they struggled against the overwhelming forces of nature . Philbrick provides an in-depth examination of the men who lost their ship and of the place they came from -- Nantucket -- which comes across as quite sinister and clannish in the 1820s . In many ways that island determined what happened , who lived and who died . The author not only puts his readers in the boats as the men fight to stay alive , he also tells the whale 's side of the story . In the pages just after the attack on the Essex , he notes that the animal has the largest brain of any creature that has lived on Earth and adds that it has a `` highly sophisticated ability to generate and process sound . '' He provides details , too , about the sperm whale 's system of communication among its own kind . By researching whales so thoroughly , Philbrick shows why where once Americans saw only a source of oil , we now see a complicated , magnificent creature that is part of the biological diversity on this planet . He also elevated the adventure of the Essex to a rich and alarming study of how and why things happened as they did , holding up what we know now of human and animal behavior against the 1820 circumstances and actions . `` In the Heart of the Sea '' is a beautifully written , terrifying book that 's so much more than an adventure yarn . Do yourself a favor and pick up a free copy at area libraries and then join in some -- or all -- of the activities planned for this Big Read . And , here 's the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance : Nathaniel Philbrick will discuss his book at the Ritz Theatre in Brunswick at 7 p.m. Thursday , Feb. 16 .

With more travelers taking international trips than ever before , we as consumers are also , at times , smothered with more options , loyalty programs and indeed niche buzzwords . From staycations to couples only retreats , many companies are trying to capture niche parts of the travel market . One aspect of vacations that have long been considered incredibly niche , and even taboo to many , have been nude holidays . Roll on 2020 and clothing-optional holidays could be bigger than ever . Bad news for bikini and swimwear outlets ! With the liberating feeling of skinny-dipping laying the foundations of breaking taboo combined with the urge for off the beaten path experiences , it seems that a growing number of people are happy to try a nakation . Add to this an increased focus on sustainability , and fast fashion being a large contributor to carbon emissions , the liberated nude vacationer could even potentially argue that they 're saving the planet by stripping off on holiday . Nude vacations are aiming to be tasteful and are about connecting with nature , whether that 's through naked hikes , cruises or even yoga . With an increasing movement for body positivity , the message is along the lines of ; why not ?! Beyond actual nude vacations , and even nude beaches which have long been popular in Europe , the growing niche segment of the clothes-free market has even expanded to restaurants in London and a topless book club in New York City . Bunyadi restaurant was London 's first naked restaurant and although starting as a pop-up , had a staggering waitlist of 44,000 people . Even the waiters served tables naked , and of course , mobile phones are banned . Commentators point to the perception that nude vacations are a natural growth of these niches that not only allow women to have body confidence but demonstrate to both men and woman that nudity does n't have to be sexualised . With availability becoming limited with some nudist holiday providers in Europe over the summer months , this would suggest that popularity is growing , and a lastminute.com survey showed that getting an `` all-over tan '' was the primary reason why holidaymakers would try a nudist holiday . There are indeed many public nudist beaches in Europe , from Brighton beach to many of the Spanish islands where the majority of the beaches are nudist-friendly . In terms of the sanctuary of nudist resorts and tailored vacations , supply is certainly increasing in Europe , but demand seems to be far outgrowing this . If you were to visit a Spa , or Onsen in Japan , or indeed Austria and Germany to name but a few countries in Europe , you wo n't be allowed to wear clothes . Bathing in the buff has been long celebrated and became the norm long ago . It just so happens that now , it has become easier than ever to try anything from naked yoga to naked cruises .

A high density of intrinsic defects would be playing a part in the carbon-supersaturation levels detected . In this work , the role of C \u2212 vacancy complexes on carbon-supersaturation in low temperature bainite is investigated by means of Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy . Results reveal the presence of a significant amount of monovacancies in the structures that plays an important role on the formation of carbon clusters in the ferrite lattice of nano-scale bainitic structures . Introduction Low-temperature bainite , mainly consisting of nano-scale plates of bainitic ferrite and carbon-enriched regions of austenite , is formed by austenite decomposition at temperatures below 350 \u00b0C in high-carbon high-silicon steels1 ,2 . Diffraction-based techniques3 ,4,5,6 together with extensive Atom Probe Tomography -LRB- APT -RRB- data analyses of these structures7 ,8,9,10 revealed a measurable tetragonality and an important amount of carbon in solid solution in the bainitic ferrite which remain even after prolonged heat treatment or subsequent tempering10 . Since the quantification of solid solutions in APT datasets is not trivial11 ,12 , the APT analyses approach was recently reconsidered13 finding that the amount of carbon that remains in solid solution in bainitic ferrite is significantly smaller than that derived from the c/a ratio of bct bainitic ferrite as determined by diffraction studies . Complementary Transmission Electron Microscopy -LRB- TEM -RRB- 14 showed that the increased tetragonality detected by diffraction analysis is the result of carbon clusters considered to be carbide embryos15 , with a composition close to the stoichiometric \u03b1 \u2033 - Fe16C2 , embedded in a carbon-depleted matrix , as in the early stages of ageing of martensites16 ,17 . In the course of the displacive transformation of the austenite , large plastic strains lead to high concentrations of intrinsic defect , with carbon interstitials binding strongly to vacancies18 . In addition , low temperature bainite formation involves a rapid quenching after austenitization , resulting in a non-equilibrium supersaturation of thermal carbon-vacancy complexes retained in the austenite , due to their increased diffusion barriers19 ,20 . It has long been known that C-vacancy complexes can also act as precursors for carbide precipitation during tempering of martensite21 , although it remains unclear if the presence of C-vacancy bonds affects carbon clustering in unstable structures . In this work , the nature of the defects and their stability in relation with the alloying elements and the transformation temperature is investigated in low temperature bainite by Positron Annihilation Spectroscopy -LRB- PAS -RRB- . PAS is sensitive to lattice defects22 and is also capable of detecting the atomic environment of positron annihilation sites23 . Open-volume defects , such as vacancies , vacancy-clusters , or solute -- vacancy complexes , are effective traps for thermalized positrons in metals . The annihilation radiation of a positron trapped in a defect conveys information about the nature of the defect . The positron lifetime distribution provides information on the type , size and concentration of the defects . In addition , information about the chemical surround of the positron annihilation site can be obtained using the annihilation radiation peak at 511 keV through its Doppler broadening , as it depends on the momentum of the electrons annihilating with the thermalized positrons24 ,25 . This assessment is of prime interest to understand carbon super-saturation in bainitic ferrite and its relation to lattice defects . Materials and Experimental Procedure The chemical composition of the studied alloy is Fe-0 .66 C-1 .45 Si-1 .35 Mn-1 .02 Cr-0 .10 Ni-0 .24 Mo in mass fraction . Each sample was austenitized at 900 \u00b0C , for 15 min and subsequently cooled at 50 \u00b0C / s to the bainite reaction temperature , between 220 and 300 \u00b0C , held for enough time to ensure the completion of the transformation , and subsequently quenched to room temperature . Transformation kinetics and structure description have been reported in previous works , see refs . 10,13,26 In addition , martensite and pearlite structures were obtained after fully austenitization at 900 \u00b0C for 15 min and subsequent continuous cooling at 50 \u00b0C / s and 0.1 \u00b0C / s , respectively . Bainitic structures are encoded as Bx , where x is the bainite transformation temperature , while the pearlite and martensite structures are encoded as PER and MAR , respectively -LRB- See Table 1 -RRB- . Table 1 PLS results for the structures formed in the studied steel . Full size table The PAS experiments were performed in a fast-fast spectrometer configured in coincidence . The time resolution was determined using a 22Na source -LRB- Kapton sealed -RRB- placed between a pair of reference samples , resulting in 230 ps -LRB- FWHM -RRB- . Positron lifetime spectra -LRB- PLS -RRB- with a total count > 106 were fitted subtracting the corrections due to positron annihilation in the 22Na source . Reference samples of pure Fe annealed at 800 \u00b0C during 9 hours , and Si single crystals were used to determine the instrumental time resolution and the source correction for the lifetime spectra . The source contribution was determined as ; 382 ps with 13.6 % intensity along with another component of ~ 1.2 ns , with 0.2 % intensity , corresponding to the interaction with the surface of the source . Spectra were fitted with the PATFIT-88 package27 . Coincidence Doppler Broadening -LRB- CDB -RRB- measurements were performed placing the samples at the center of a face-to-face configuration of two high-purity germanium detectors -LRB- HPGe -RRB- set in timing coincidence . A series of individual spectra , with a count number > 106 in a 512 \u00d7 512 coincidence matrix each , were used to achieve cumulative spectra -LRB- after checking the absence of electronic shift -RRB- with 1 \u00d7 107 counts in the strip centered on the matrix diagonal -LRB- defined as \\ -LRB- 2 -LCB- m -RCB- _ -LCB- 0 -RCB- -LCB- c -RCB- ^ -LCB- 2 -RCB- -1.6 \\ , -LCB- \\ rm -LCB- keV -RCB- -RCB- < -LCB- E -RCB- _ -LCB- 1 -RCB- + -LCB- E -RCB- _ -LCB- 2 -RCB- < 2 -LCB- m -RCB- _ -LCB- 0 -RCB- -LCB- c -RCB- ^ -LCB- 2 -RCB- +1.6 \\ , -LCB- \\ rm -LCB- keV -RCB- -RCB- \\ -RRB- , where E1 and E2 stand for the energies of the pair of annihilating photons , \\ -LRB- -LCB- m -RCB- _ -LCB- 0 -RCB- = 5.110 \\ times -LCB- 10 -RCB- ^ -LCB- 2 -RCB- \\ , \\ text -LCB- keV -RCB- / -LCB- c -RCB- ^ -LCB- 2 -RCB- \\ -RRB- is the electron rest mass and c is the speed of light -RRB- . The spectra were re-binned from 512 \u00d7 512 to 40 \u00d7 40 energy groups with a bin width of 2.5 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3 m0c to decrease the statistical fluctuations of the data in the high momentum region . Aiming to highlight the differences between the spectra , ratio curves were obtained -LRB- after normalizing -RRB- dividing by the corresponding CDB spectrum of a pure annealed Fe reference sample . Results and Discussion Vacancies are the dominant self-defects at room temperature in metals . In the case of Fe , theoretical calculations indicate that di-vacancies , tri-vacancies , tetra-vacancies , compact clusters and small voids are stable28 ,29,30,31 and form various atomic configurations which are thought to be the nuclei for dislocation loops and new-types of crystal lattices29 . The common interstitial atoms in steels , i.e. , H , C and N , interact with point defects , thereby reducing their diffusivities but also modifying the migration properties of those point defects30 ,32,33,34 . In both low and high carbon steels , vacancies have a carbon dimer bound to them18 ,33,35,36,37 , where carbon does not occupy a vacant Fe lattice site , but a position close to its preferred interstitial site -LRB- octahedral interstice -RRB- at one of the cube faces bounding the vacancy35 . Theoretical models predict that the formation of such vacancy-carbon complexes significantly reduces the vacancy diffusivity in bcc Fe , exhibiting non-Arrhenius behavior32 ,33 . Besides , carbon diffusivity decreases with increasing carbon content and becomes negligible when the carbon concentration exceeds twice that of vacancies34 . The controversy on vacancy migration calls into question whether mobile carbon interstitials are trapped by stable monovacancies , or viceversa . This ` chicken and egg ' situation is translated into a carbon concentration in Fe above that expected from the thermodynamic equilibrium . Additionally , substitutional solute atoms can act as traps for vacancies and/or modify the structure and therefore the stability and migration properties of point defect clusters38 . Table 1 presents the PLS results in the structures obtained from the studied steel . For each of the structures , more than 106 single annihilation events were recorded in order to obtain the complete positron lifetime spectrum N -LRB- t -RRB- , where the k different components contributing to the positron trapping with 2 source corrections components in the spectra with the individual lifetimes \u03c4i , and intensities Ii . Results in Table 1 were obtained from data fitting to Eq . -LRB- 1 -RRB- by minimizing the Chi-square function defined as : where in Eq . -LRB- 2 -RRB- , ei are the experimental values and fi are the values obtained fitting Eq . -LRB- 1 -RRB- after convoluting each component with the time resolution function of the spectrometer , 230 ps -LRB- FWHM -RRB- . This function was then normalized based on the number of degrees of freedom and the number of fitting parameters on each case obtaining a result for the normalized Chi-square function better than 6 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3 . Fitting provided a lifetime precision of 3 ps . Values in Table 1 for the martensitic -LRB- M -RRB- and bainitic microstructures formed at different temperatures and times -LRB- B220 , B220 +6 d , B250 and B300 -RRB- show a consistent lifetime around 160 ps , whereas the pearlitic structure -LRB- PER -RRB- shows a slightly lower PLS value . The consistency of the PLS values for all bainitic microstructures , even for the over-aged sample , evidences the lack of influence of the bainite reaction temperature or the over-aging process in the nature of the positron traps . As Supplementary Information illustrates , fitting the data to a two-component model using the bulk lifetime -LRB- ~ 110 ps39 -RRB- and single vacancy lifetime -LRB- ~ 175 ps40 -RRB- , following methodology reported elsewhere41 ,42 , was unsuccessful even when fixing the lifetime parameters -LRB- with the consideration of a two-state model that would change the value measured for the bulk -RRB- . This means that the 160 ps lifetime corresponds to a type of defects whose lifetime is shorter than the lifetime associated to Fe single vacancies , and that positron trapping saturates at those defects , excluding the possibility of annihilation at the bulk or at positions related to the deformation caused by interstitials in the bulk . A lifetime shorter than that corresponding to annihilation in Fe single vacancies is associated to the annihilation in a C \u2212 vacancy pair formed by the capture of migrating vacancies by carbon atoms43 ,44 . The experimental lifetime obtained for these C-vacancy pairs has been reported to be ~ 160 ps45 . The positron trapping rate for the C \u2212 vacancy pair and the mono-vacancy in the Fe \u2212 C system can be considered as equal46 . Vehanen et al. 43 stated that considering the same trapping rate for vacancies in Fe-C alloys and in C-vacancy pairs , could possibly lead to a slight underestimation of the pair concentration , suggesting that even when the trapping rates might not be equal , they must be similar . This means that the positron trapping process is analogous in C \u2212 vacancy and in Fe \u2212 vacancy positions , so the elemental affinity for positrons takes a major role in the process . The fact that carbon has a high affinity for positrons46 explains the impossibility of determining the annihilation component in the bulk of the material , rather than having a high concentration of defects that would produce saturation in the positron trapping . The characteristics of the CDB ratio curves for the microstructures obtained from the studied steel are shown in Fig. 1 , along with the ratio curves for the major alloying elements -LRB- C , Si , Mn and Cr -RRB- . All the CDB curves are normalized to the one for a pure annealed Fe reference sample as this is the predominant element in the alloy . CDB curves normalized to the other component of the alloy were also obtained attempting to highlight some behaviors , but the results was substantially less clear than the CDB curves normalized to Fe , probably because of the high number of components of the alloy and their reduced relative amount . The deviation between different curves of the same sample in same conditions corresponds to the uncertainty of the experiment . Deviations from the unity in the CBD ratio curves are the result of positron trapping in defects with a configurational surrounding that can contain , either concurrently or separately , C , Si , Cr or Mn . Shifting in the CDB ratio spectra of the analyzed structures towards the CDB signature curve of certain pure alloying element -LRB- here C , Si , Cr or Mn -RRB- can be only interpreted as an association of the defects in the structures with that alloying element . The possibility that the shift of CDB curve could be related to a precipitation process can be ruled out since carbides are formed by para-equilibrium growth -LRB- i.e. without partitioning of substitutional elements across carbide particles -RRB- during bainite reaction at low temperature7 . Parameters W and S associated to the CDB data were calculated in an attempt to improve the understanding of the nature of the positron traps in the alloy ; but W-S plots provided no conclusive information . This might be caused by the fact that the alloy present positron traps associated to different structures resulting in a complex W-S plot that can not interpreted with the classic W-S parameters theory . This could imply that the saturation in the positron trapping evidenced in PLS might be caused by this existence of several kind of structures associated to the traps more than a high amount of a single type of defect . The CDB curve for the pearlitic microstructure -LRB- PER -RRB- evidences a low amount of vacancy-type defects , given that it stays close to unity for all momentum regions meaning that almost matches the curve distribution of the annealed `` defect-less '' Fe . On the contrary , the shape of the CDB curves of the martensitic and bainitic structures is similar while gets away from the unity , implying that the defect distribution has no major chemical change on its surroundings despite the microstructure obtained . The shape of the CDB curves can be considered to have two contributions , C and/or Si , and Cr and/or Mn . The CDB curves are based in the electron configurations , so that elements of the same chemical group share the same signature curve at high-momentum regions -LRB- above 20 \u00b7 10 \u2212 3 m0c -RRB- , as seen in the CDB curves for carbon and silicon in Fig. 1 . The only difference is related to the annihilation with electrons coming from the core of the atom that modifies the shape of the curve at mid-momentum -LRB- below 20 \u00b7 10 \u2212 3 m0c -RRB- and low-momentum region -LRB- below 10 \u00b7 10 \u2212 3 m0c -RRB- . Thus , the contribution of silicon -LRB- with external electron configuration 3s23p2 -RRB- and carbon -LRB- with external electron configuration 2s22p2 -RRB- to the CDB curves for the studied alloy can be only distinguished by the analysis of the mid and low-momentum region in which carbon presents lower slope and values nearer to the unit as compared to silicon . Since the microstructures studied present a CDB curve very similar among them , and the slope of these curves at the low-momentum region is analogous to that of carbon , it might be derived that the contribution of silicon is marginal . No evidences of an interaction between silicon and carbon could be concluded form these experimental results , as suggested by previous theoretical calculations47 . The Cr and Mn contents of the steel are comparable . These two alloying elements have also similar electron configurations within the ground state , 4s13d5 and 4s23d5 , respectively , and similar positron affinity ; resulting in analogous CDB spectra that are almost impossible to distinguish in any momentum region -LRB- see Fig. 1 -RRB- . Using additional CDB curves referenced to Cr and Mn to settle this influence was unsuccessful due to the great similarity of both reference curves requiring additional arguments to clarify the role of each component of the alloy . The contribution of these elements is expected to be lower than the carbon and silicon contributions due to the lower content in the alloy . It is known that Mn and C form dipoles in both the fcc and bcc lattices of Fe due to their high binding energy -LRB- ~ 0.36 eV -RRB- 48,49,50,51 , which is increased by the presence of Si52 . Experimental results in the Fe \u2212 C \u2212 Mn system indicate that the solubility of carbon in bcc-Fe below 550 \u00b0C increases with an increase in the Mn content of the steel51 and the presence of Mn \u2212 C dipoles has been suggested to be a contributing factor to the observed carbon super-saturation in bainitic ferrite53 . Therefore , it can be argued that the major contribution to the studied steel CDB curve is more dominated by Mn than by Cr because of the presence of carbon in the environment of vacancies , as evidenced by PLS and CBD . Overall , the CDB curves of the bainitic structures in Fig. 1 shifts towards the carbon CDB signature curve as the transformation temperature decreases . The largest differences among the bainitic structures are observed in the mid-momentum region and part of the high-momentum region . The largest shift from unity is observed for the bainitic structure overaged at 220 \u00b0C for 6 days followed , in descending order , by the bainitic structures formed at 220 , 250 and 300 \u00b0C . Thus , the present results indicate that a decrease in the transformation temperature results in larger amounts of carbon -LRB- with a contribution of Mn -RRB- bound to vacancy-type defects . Lower transformation temperatures are translated into higher amounts of bainitic ferrite with also higher levels of carbon super-saturation in bainitic ferrite9 ,10 . Therefore , the presence of C-vacancy complexes should contribute to the carbon super-saturation levels detected in bainitic ferrite . It is speculated that the low mobility of the C-vacancy complexes in the bainitic ferrite matrix hinders the carbon decarburization of bainitic ferrite promoting \u03b1 `` - type ordering processes observed in APT reconstructions reported elsewhere14 . Conclusions Positron Lifetime Spectroscopy measurements have revealed the presence of a significant amount of monovacancies in low temperature bainite , that would assist in retaining carbon in bainitic ferrite by the formation of C \u2212 vacancy complexes . The low mobility of these complexes in the ferrite impedes the full partitioning of carbon towards the austenite/ferrite interface promoting carbon clustering phenomena in the ferritic phase formed at low temperature . Complementary simulations studies are required to explain the observed C \u2212 vacancy complexes stability . For that purpose , first the development of a new Fe-C interatomic potential to use in Molecular Dynamics and Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations is required . This investigation is in progress .

At an open house last week at the UNITE Here offices in northeast Minnesota , representatives from ROC MN spoke directly to union members about their work and vision . ROC Lead Organizer Eli Edleson-Stein announced that after years of operating as a volunteer organization they now have 1.5 staff members dedicated to their work . Edleson-Stein pointed out that in the United States , 1 in 3 individuals works in the restaurant industry at some point in their life and over half have had their first job in restaurants . The most maddening statistic discussed is that in Minnesota just under 10 % of the private sector workforce is in restaurant work . However , the industry accounts for over a quarter of all wage theft claims and is the number one source of sexual harassment claims filed by women to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . At ROC MN these disparities are a great cause for concern and demand action and organizing . According to Edleson-Stein , in addition to ROC MN 's advocacy for a $ 15 minimum wage without a tip credit , they have also `` started to take on workplace fights , as a strategy to build political consciousness and a political identity for workers in the restaurant industry . '' Ther intent is to work with unions to build collective power for all workers . Mia Bradford has been a ROC organizer ever since she stood up to bosses that took half her tips , and decided she would n't take it anymore . Bradford has seen co-workers living paycheck to paycheck , struggling to survive on low wages compounded by stolen tips . Many are also going to school or are single mothers and are sleep deprived trying to balance everything just so they can pay the rent and have a place to live . For many , the only way to catch up is to grind harder and work more hours . Bradford learned that instead of devoting more time and energy to an abusive workplace , it 's better to organize and change that environment . An abusive workplace means that the job becomes a massive barrier in a worker 's ability to succeed in life . Bradford further expressed her motivations saying , `` Everyone has hardships in life , but you do n't have to deal with them alone . If we come together then we can win . When we fight families can afford school clothes for their kids . When we fight , people can afford rent . When we fight , those people in school can sleep . When we fight single mothers can enjoy playing with our kids instead of worrying about a financial crisis . When we fight , we stop anxiety , depression , mental illness from living like your whole life , your whole world will collapse if you do n't have enough for rent . '' Kevin Osborne has been working in the restaurant industry since he was 17 . Osborne made sure to let the labor members and leaders know that long-standing labor standards , common for unionized workforces are nonexistent in the restaurant industry . Wage theft , overwork , and other day-to-day indignities are rampant . He expressed his frustrations with the industry commenting that , `` I figured that everybody here , whether organized or unorganized , we got the same problem . We work for a boss , a business owner or an investor that figures , they know a hell of a lot about us . They figure they know if we need health care . They figure they know if we make enough to pay our rent . They figure they know if we deserve paternal or maternal leave to be with our kids . They seem to know a hell of a lot about us and they seem to know what we deserve and it usually seems to be damn little when even a sliver of their profits is on the line . '' Osborne remembers that since his first day in the industry washing dishes , he 's been told that it 's impossible to organize restaurant workers . He heard it so many times that he started to believe it . But with the support of the assembled crowd , the impossible seems possible .", "url": "https://www.workdayminnesota.org/roc-mn-is-making-waves-in-the-restaurant-industry/", "kws": ["ROC^^MN", "restaurants", "Restaurant^^Opportunity^^Center", "Restaurant^^workers", "restaurant^^work", "northeast^^Minnesota", "private^^sector", "demand", "collective^^power", "long-standing^^labor^^standards", "wage^^theft", "unionized^^workforces", "United^^States", "union^^members", "staff^^members", "single^^mothers", "unions", "rent", "co-workers", "Mia^^Bradford"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Society": 0.5727404952049255}, "second_cat": {"Society_Other": 0.5727404952049255}}}

You may , in fact , think that life is everything you hoped it would or could be . Or maybe it just does n't matter to you ... you 're cool , no matter what . But you 'll certainly give that question some thought , and may even get the chance to voice your opinion on it , when you take advantage of seeing the Red Barn Theatre 's delightful production of playwright Aaron Posner 's `` Life Sucks , '' now playing on its stage through Feb. 8 . `` Life Sucks , '' loosely based on Chekhov 's `` Uncle Vanya '' -LRB- stress the `` loosely based '' -RRB- , is , quite simply , a hilarious take on love , longing and loss , falling in love with the wrong people and trying to change a life you very often perceive as being miserable , but in reality , is pretty much okay . In two hours , we meet a group of characters , each of whom is on that `` life sucks '' spectrum somewhere . In a grand old estate house , we meet the Professor , whose sexy young wife , Elle , everyone else in the place is in love with . Either her , or the handsome , pretty-much always inebriated Dr. Astor . Or they 're longing for a love they 've never had , as is the adorable Pickles . Then there 's the middle-aged , dispirited Vanya , who , with the Professor 's daughter , Sonia , manages the property . Sonia firmly believes life sucks because Dr. Astor wo n't give her the time of day , and Vanya 's the guy who feels he bit the sour apple . The only balanced person in the place is a wise woman named Babs , who tries to impart love , affection and wisdom to all the others , often without success . And the spark that lights the fuse of this very funny play ? The Professor announces that he intends to sell the estate because he needs money , throwing all of their lives into disarray . That 's when the fun really begins . And that fun often will involve the audience , as the characters every now and then will break the fourth wall and address them , asking what they think , and actually hoping for a response . So if your life sucks too , you 'll get a chance to let them know . Director Joy Hawkins could n't have asked for a better cast of actors to bring Posner 's hilarious play to life : David Black , George DiBraud , Aaron Duclos , Jessica Miano Kruel , Karl M. Stahl , Caroline Taylor and Susannah Wells are wonderful . Each of them is perfect in their role , able to play any line for the laughs or poignancy the play requires . There 's not a moment they wo n't engage you completely -- including , quite literally , the end of the play -- but you 'll need to see it to enjoy that final bit of fun ... we do n't want to spoil it for you . Key West artist Rick Worth , along with the Red Barn 's Gary and Jack McDonald , has provided one of his very special painted sets , depicting the formal gardens of the family estate . It 's a colorful backdrop to this delightful play . Tickets for all remaining performances of `` Life Sucks '' are available at redbarntheatre.com or by calling 305-296-9911 .

Epidemiology data regarding mucosal melanomas in Brazil is scarce , hence the motivation to conduct this research paper . The \u03c72 test was used to compare categorical variables . Forward stepwise logistic regression method was used in the multivariate analysis to identify independent predictors of early death . A total of 801 patients were included in the analysis . Surgical resection is frequently the first approach to primary tumours -LRB- 65.3 % -RRB- , even though the utility of lymph node surgery and radiation therapy is not well established . Advanced stage was observed in more than two thirds of patients . Early death was observed in 28.3 % . MM cases with regional or distant metastases as well as those located in unusual locations had almost 4 times more risk for early death . Besides that , MM located in lips , oral cavity and pharynx and those receiving chemotherapy had 2 times more risk of early death . Introduction Mucosal melanoma -LRB- MM -RRB- is a primary malignant neoplasia originated from melanocytes within mucous membranes in any part of mucosal surface lining , more commonly , the head and neck region , followed by anorectal mucosa and vulvovaginal mucosa1 ,2,3 . MM is rare and represents approximately 1 % of all melanoma cases1 . On top of that , the disease has a terrible prognosis , with a five year survival rate of only 25 % compared to 80 % in cutaneous melanomas1 ,2 . Feller and collaborators state that regardless of the treatment approach , MM is constantly fatal4 . Notwithstanding , Ascierto and collaborators believe that the advances in melanoma treatment , especially related to the new discoveries on the scope of the molecular profile of these tumours , boosted the optimism when it comes to the possibility of more effective systemic therapies available5 . There is a lack of nationwide studies regarding MMs in Brazil . The purpose of this research was to fill this gap clarifying the scientific community about the epidemiological characteristics of MM in the country with special emphasis on MM 's early death predictors . Results Considering the Hospital Cancer Registry , 801 cases of MM were registered for sixteen years in Brazil -LRB- Table 1 -RRB- . Vulva , vagina and uterine cervix are the most prevalent sites with 33.7 % of cases , followed by lips , oral cavity and pharynx -LRB- 23.1 % -RRB- , anal and rectal -LRB- 17.9 % -RRB- and nasal and paranasal mucosae -LRB- 17.7 % -RRB- . Table 1 Anatomic location of Mucosal Melanoma in Brazil . Full size table In men , from 2000 to 2016 , the most frequent anatomic location of MM was labial , oral cavity and pharyngeal , with 93 -LRB- 35.6 % -RRB- out of 261 cases . On the other hand , women presented 270 -LRB- 50.0 % -RRB- cases related to vulva , vagina and cervix out of 540 cases . Patients present with MM usually at more advanced age , particularly from 50 to 79 years old -LRB- two thirds of cases -RRB- . A total of 26.0 % of patients present with MM from 60 to 69 years old , with the highest frequency for each subtype of MM , with the exception of vulva , vaginal and cervix , with 22.2 % , although very close to 23.0 % of patients ranging from 70 -- 79 years old -LRB- Table 2 -RRB- . Table 2 Demographic characteristics of Mucosal Melanoma in Brazil . Full size table More than two thirds of patients had regional or distant metastases at the time of diagnosis . The majority of cases , ranging from 76.9 % in anorectal MM to 89.2 % in labial , pharynx and oral MM received any type of treatment . Treatment modalities were surgery combined with other modality at any point -LRB- 65.3 % -RRB- , radiotherapy combined with other modality at any point -LRB- 36.9 % -RRB- and chemotherapy combined with other modality at any time -LRB- 31.7 % -RRB- . Mortality for MM before the end of the first treatment or before 12 months in Brazil ranged from 17.1 % in nasal and paranasal mucosa to 44.1 % in digestive organs , respiratory tract and intrathoracic organs , penis and other male urinary tract non-specified MM , genitourinary tract , peritoneum and retroperitoneum MM . Regarding the status of patients at the end of first course of treatment , progressive disease , relapsed disease or death were the highest -LRB- 68.9 % -RRB- in anorectal MM and partial remission , stable disease and complete response reached 63.0 % in nasal and paranasal MM -LRB- Table 3 -RRB- . Table 3 Clinical characteristics of Mucosal Melanoma in Brazil . Full size table The univariate analysis of the risk factors for early death in mucosal melanoma is presented in Table 4 , while the multivariate analysis is presented in Table 5 . MM cases with regional or distant metastases as well as those located in the digestive organs , respiratory tract and intrathoracic organs , penis and other male urinary tract non-specified , genitourinary tract , peritoneum and retroperitoneum had almost 4 times more risk for early death . Besides that , MM located in lips , oral cavity and pharynx and those receiving chemotherapy had 2 times , anal and rectal MM had 2.6 times and MM in unusual locations had 3.8 times more risk of early death as opposed to nasal and paranasal MM . When the clinical stage was missing the risk of death was 3 times higher . Table 4 Risk for early death * in Mucosal Melanoma in Brazil . Full size table Table 5 Independent risk factors for early death * in Mucosal Melanoma in Brazil . Full size table Discussion We believe that this is the largest scientific report of MMs considering its national perspective epidemiologically and the single one in the Americas . Two thirds of patients presented the disease at advanced stage with 28.3 % of early death . A European study evaluated retrospectively the epidemiology of four hundred and forty-four individuals attending fifteen German skin cancer centers with MM . This German study reveal that anorectal , female genital tract and head and neck MMs prognostic differences are most likely related to early neoplastic events , before distant metastatic stage6 , reinforcing the importance of early diagnosis also in grave and rare diseases such as MM . An Asian study evaluated the natural history and metastasis pattern prospectively for 706 patients with MM for 8 years7 , although MM is the second most common type of melanoma in the continent , after acral lentiginous melanoma , very different from all other parts of the world . Few studies also evaluated MM from all mucosal surfaces , either from a single institution8 or from a national database9 , although both presented a limited sample size . In addition , Schaefer presented 64 % of death8 compared to 28.3 % in our study , in 5 years and 1 year , respectively , which could explain such a difference , apart from the sample number limitations for a single institute of the earlier . Aggressive tumors such as MM often have different genetic aberrations compared to cutaneous melanomas and are frequently treated with surgery3 . Combined with other sort of treatment modality , in the present study surgery ranged from 50.9 % in anorectal MM to 78.4 % of female reproductive system in the sample studied -LRB- p < 0.001 -RRB- . With regards to Immunotherapy , which could minimize the surgical approach , such as involving anti-PD-1 agents , there is scientific evidence for use , not only in mucosal , but also in acral melanomas . Recently , response rates to PD-1 blockade in patients with acral and MMs were slightly lower but comparable to response rates in cutaneous melanomas and support the routine use of anti-PD-1 agents for MM10 . Staging of MM is essential , especially to determine if the disease reached distant metastasis stage1 ,3,5,11 . Even though initial staging was not according to the new staging classification for MM12 , it is clear most cases were diagnosed already with distant metastases in Brazilian patients , highlighting the relevance for an early diagnosis of the disease . In addition , for head and neck mucosal melanoma -LRB- HNMM -RRB- , primary tumor size seems to be associated with distant metastasis13 . In Brazil the 60 days law determines that the public health treatment for any malignancy should start within this time frame14 . Time between diagnosis and treatment could be implicated as critical to MM patients from Brazil . Over a third of patients -LRB- 38.7 % -RRB- had to wait more than 60 days from diagnosis to treatment . Most patients with MM in unusual locations -LRB- digestive organs , respiratory tract and intrathoracic organs , penis and other male urinary tract non-specified , genitourinary , peritoneum and retroperitoneum -RRB- showed up at the hospital without diagnosis or previous treatment , which probably means that required expertise and technology for diagnosis were only available at the cancer hospitals network and not at primary or secondary care . The dramatic therapeutic advances in melanoma field and the poor prognosis of patients with MM mandates continued emphasis on laboratory and clinical research efforts in this rare and serious disease11 not only in Brazil , but worldwide . Stage IV was the clinical initial staging for most cases in this study -LRB- ranging from 36.6 % in vulva , vagina and cervix to 66.7 % for other mucosae -RRB- . It is recommended to suppress T1 and T2 skipping the primary tumor from T0 , given that MM are aggressive tumors . When the primary tumor is not detectable or it is superficially located , it should be staged as T3 . Moderate or very advanced disease should be staged as T412 The AJCC published further data regarding melanoma staging15 , nonetheless , MM is not mentioned specifically16 . A specific TNM classification was developed for skin and ocular lesions and a very basic classification for HNMM which was designed as follows : stage I when only local disease is present ; stage II , when neck lymph node metastasis is present and stage III : when distant metastasis is detected5 . Nevertheless , upper aerodigestive tract MM are present at the new TNM classification . This classification is only directed to HNMM . Although , Ballester S\u00e1nchez et al. takes into account the Ballantyne simplified staging method to all MM , with the single modification related to stage II in neck lymph nodes , which extrapolates to the regional lymph node involvement1 . In order to provide an ideal treatment planning and prognostication , there is a need for the validation of specific staging methods for all locations of MMs2 . Some limitations of this study are related to the fact that it is based on secondary database . Hence , there was no histopathological , immunological or molecular revision of MM , also making it difficult to discuss further therapeutic opportunities in detail . In addition , significant variables such as C51 .0 category -LRB- labium majus -RRB- from ICD-O-3 does not allow to distinguish between skin and mucosa , making it possible that some of the vulvar melanoma could be from the skin instead of mucosa . Ulceration , thickness or depth of the primary tumor for localized disease , number of metastatic lymph node for regional disease , and the metastatic organ would be better predictors of prognosis . Also , the survival analysis with identification of associated factors by Cox regression would be more appropriate , but available data do not include time between diagnosis and death or last follow-up and it was not possible to perform Kaplan Meier/Cox Regression analyzes since this is a public domain secondary database analysis with pre-defined variables . Last but not least , the absence of important variables such as histopathological , molecular , clinical and therapeutic variables , as well as date of diagnosis and date of death were mostly not available . Strengths include a large sample size , all anatomic sites presenting with MM and evaluation of the disease in a real-life setting . Late diagnosis and early death are eminent challenges to the Brazilian healthcare system related to MM management . A recently published whole genome sequencing study revealed a heterogeneous MM profile based not only on the pattern of mutations but also on body site-specific driver mutations with genetic ancestry or geographic location playing a significant role17 . Nevertheless , such studies need to be conducted with larger cohorts and preferably with all sorts of geographic locations , including the genetically diverse Brazilian population . It may safely be said , personalized medicine for MM is on the way . The insertion of mutational profile of MMs should be always considered in routine clinical settings in order to evaluate the applicability of the available target therapy for each case . It appears that the mutational landscape of mucosal melanoma points out to a distinct pattern between the upper and lower regions of MM commitment with SF3B1 and KIT presenting higher mutation rates than the common drivers of cutaneous melanomas , namely BRAF and NRAS . This slightly different mutational profile amongst MMs might help provide new comprehension of this grave disease and personalize therapeutic options for such patients in the era of precision medicine18 . In addition , MMs usually present a low point mutation burden even though with a high number of structural variants . SF3B1 , KIT , BRAF , NRAS , NF1 , TP53 , SPRED1 , CHD8 , ATRX , and HLA-A are the genes that usually present significant mutations . Yet , in terms of structural variants , TERT , MDM2 and CDK4 are the most usual targets to present structural rearrangements17 . Methods Study population Study population . A retrospective cohort study was conducted with patients diagnosed with MM between 2000 and 2016 . Information from Brazilian hospital-based cancer registries , obtained through the Integrator System -LRB- Brazilian National Cancer Institute -- INCA , available at https://irhc.inca.gov.br/RHCNet/visualizaTabNetExterno.action -RRB- and S\u00e3o Paulo 's Hospital Cancer Registry -LRB- Oncocentro Foundation , available at http://200.144.1.68/cgi-bin/dh?rhc/rhc-geral.def -RRB- were merged . The final database included information from 310 cancer hospitals from the 25 states and the Federal District of Brazil . Data were obtained on August 7 , 2018 . There was no central pathology review . Data analysis Patients were followed up until the end of first course of treatment -LRB- INCA -RRB- or 12 months -LRB- Oncocentro Foundation -RRB- . The following variables were collected : age at diagnosis -LRB- in years -RRB- , sex , year of diagnosis , anatomic location and histological type -LRB- according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology , third Edition - ICD-O-3 -RRB- , clinical stage at diagnosis -LRB- Localized Melanoma - Stages I and II versus Regional or Distant metastases - Stages III , with lymph node metastasis and IV , with distant metastasis -RRB- , time from diagnosis to treatment -LRB- \u2264 60 days versus > 60 days -RRB- , first-course therapy -LRB- surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy -RRB- and status at the end of the first course of treatment , classified using Surveillance , Epidemiology and End Results - SEER - definitions19 . The considered outcome was early death , defined as death before the end of the first treatment or before 12 months . Statistical analysis A descriptive analysis was performed using frequencies for the categorical variables . Missing values have been excluded from analysis and only valid percents were shown . The \u03c72 test was used to compare categorical variables . A univariate analysis was performed using Odd Ratios -LRB- OR -RRB- with 95 % confidence intervals -LRB- 95 % CI -RRB- . Forward stepwise logistic regression method was used in the multivariate analysis to identify independent predictors of early death . Differences were considered statistically significant when p values were < 0.05 . The statistical software package used was SPSS , version 21.0 -LRB- S\u00e3o Paulo , Brazil -RRB- .

The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of a culture medium supplemented with amniotic-derived microvesicles -LRB- MVs -RRB- on in vitro embryo hatching after cryopreservation , and pregnancy rate following embryo transfer . In addition , miRNA profiling of blastocysts produced in vitro , with or without -LRB- control ; CTR -RRB- amniotic MV supplementation , was also evaluated using blastocysts produced in vivo . In vitro embryos were cultured with and without amniotic MV supplementation . In vivo blastocysts were obtained from superovulated cows . Samples for RNA isolation were obtained from three pools of 10 embryos each -LRB- in vivo , in vitro-CTR and in vitro + MVs -RRB- . Our results show that the hatching percentage of cryopreserved in vitro + MVs embryos is higher -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- than in vitro-CTR embryos and the pregnancy rate with fresh and cryopreserved in vitro + MVs embryos is higher than in vitro-CTR embryos . In addition , the analysis of differently expressed -LRB- DE -RRB- microRNAs showed that embryos produced in vivo are clearly different from those produced in vitro . Moreover , in vitro-CTR and in vitro + MVs embryos differ significantly for expression of two miRNAs that were found in higher concentrations in in vitro-CTR embryos . Interestingly , these two miRNAs were also reported in degenerated bovine embryos compared to good quality blastocysts . In conclusion , MV addition during in vitro production of embryos seems to counteract the adverse effect of in vitro culture and partially modulate the expression of specific miRNAs involved in successful embryo implantation . Introduction In the mammalian reproductive tract , the oviduct secretes a variety of growth factors and cytokines , which may play an essential role in the development of initial stages of pre-implantation embryos1 . The absence of these maternal-embryo signals could be an important cause of the poor quality of in vitro produced embryos -LRB- IVP -RRB- , compared to those collected in vivo2 ,3 . To mimic the in vivo crosstalk between oviduct and embryo and to improve the quality of in vitro produced embryos , co-culture systems with somatic cells have been widely used to increase blastocyst percentage and quality of the resulting embryos , and the induction of specific transcriptomic changes4 . Unfortunately , concern regarding viral transmission has resulted in the elimination of co-culture and the development of improved culture methods characterized by definite medium as synthetic oviductal fluid with amino acids -LRB- SOFaa5 -RRB- . However , the maternal-embryo communication in vivo and the communication between monolayer -LRB- ` helper ' -RRB- cells and embryos in vitro , take place not only through soluble factors -LRB- growth factors , receptors and binding proteins -RRB- secreted by cells and embryos in the medium6 ,7 but also from insoluble factors . Recent studies have demonstrated that some molecules , including mRNA fragments and microRNAs -LRB- miRNAs -RRB- , can not freely cross the membrane and are thus released into the extracellular vesicle -LRB- EV -RRB- before its release from the cells8 . In addition to genetic material , EVs contain molecules such as cytoskeletal proteins , immunoregulator molecules , signal transduction molecules , tetraspanins , heat shock protein , lipid rafts , etc9 . The EVs can be categorized as exosomes or microvesicles -LRB- MVs -RRB- , depending on the mechanisms responsible for their biogenesis . Exosomes , derived from multivesicular bodies , are released after fusion with the plasma membrane and vary in size from 30 to 100 nm , while MVs are formed and shed directly from the plasma membrane and have a size between 100 -- 1000 nm10 . Extracellular vesicles can be detected in all body fluids as well as in culture medium collected from different cell lines8 and appear to be the major mechanism by which cells communicate with their environment . Until now no one has studied the role of EVs in paracrine mechanisms in vitro however , it is important to develop an effective embryo culture medium that might eventually also improve the efficacy of human embryo culture programs . To improve the quality of in vitro produced bovine embryos , in our previous study11 bovine embryos were co-cultured with endometrial or amniotic-derived EVs . Using Nanosight and transmission electron microscope evaluation , these EVs were identified as MVs , based on their size and biogenesis . During the co-culture , amniotic or endometrial derived-MVs labelled with PKH26 were internalized into bovine blastomeres but the amniotic derived MVs have a number of effects on the embryo : increase the number of cells constituting the inner cell mass , improving quality , increasing viability , increasing expression of GPX1 gene -LRB- protective against lipid peroxidation -RRB- and reducing expression of BAX gene -LRB- involved in apoptosis -RRB- compared to endometrial MVs and control -LRB- CTR -RRB- . The amniotic secretome appears to better support in vitro embryo growth than the endometrial secretome . This result was surprising but it is likely that endometrial cells de-differentiate during culture in monolayers by losing cell polarity , cell height , ciliation , secretory activity , and responsiveness to hormones12 ,13,14,15 . In this way , the secretions produced by endometrial cells in vitro are different from the in vivo secretions . Moreover , it is probable that amniotic and endometrial secretomes contain different components attributable to the different age of this tissue -LRB- adult for endometrium and fetal for amnion -RRB- however , there is no data in the literature to support this hypothesis . To further study the effects of amniotic-derived MVs on bovine embryos and to evaluate whether MVs may potentially influence embryo implantation , we analysed in vitro embryo hatching after cryopreservation and pregnancy rate following embryo transfer . In addition , the profiles of microRNAs -LRB- miRNAs -RRB- were characterized in in vitro produced embryos with and without MV supplementation as well as in in vivo produced embryos . The miRNAs are non-coding RNA molecules of about 22 nucleotides in length that can modulate transcription/expression levels of many target genes16 ,17 . The regulatory properties of miRNAs and their roles in mammalian gametogenesis and signaling in the context of embryonic development and implantation is well documented18 ,19 . In addition , miRNAs have been reported to serve as non-invasive biomarkers to assess preimplantation developmental competence and embryo selection20 . Results Amniotic cell isolation and characterization by reverse transcription-PCR analysis Amniotic derived cells -LRB- AMCs -RRB- showed a typical stem cell phenotype -LRB- Fig. 1A -RRB- and expressed MSC -LRB- CD29 , CD44 , CD105 , CD166 -RRB- but not hematopoietic -LRB- CD34 and CD14 -RRB- markers . No expression of the Major Histocompatibility Complex , class II -LRB- MHC-II -RRB- was detected although MHC-I was found . Moreover , MSCs were found to express Oct-4 and c-Myc -LRB- Fig. 1B -RRB- . These data are in concordance with those reported by Lange-Consiglio et al. 21 . EV identification NanoSight analysis determined that amniotic EVs had a dimension between 75 nm and 700 nm , with a mean of 275 \u00b1 8.4 nm -LRB- Fig. 2 -RRB- . These characteristics , classify these EVs as microvesicles -LRB- MVs -RRB- . Percentage of in vitro produced embryos A total of 3782 oocytes were fertilized over the course of 18 replicates . Embryo morphology was evaluated on day 7 after fertilization under a stereomicroscope -LRB- Leica microsystems , Milan , Italy -RRB- and the embryos were grouped according to their development stage -LRB- morula , compact morula , and blastocyst -RRB- . Poor quality morulas/compact morulas were classified as degenerate if there was a loss of plasma membrane integrity -LRB- lysis -RRB- and/or generalized loss of cell forms . The percentage of B7 was 34.59 \u00b1 1.32 % -LRB- 709/2050 -RRB- in in vitro-CTR and 34.24 \u00b1 1.71 % -LRB- 593/1732 -RRB- in in vitro + MVs -LRB- P > 0.05 -RRB- -LRB- Table 1 -RRB- . Table 1 Data obtained under different experimental conditions in vitro and in vivo . Full size table Survival percentage after cryopreservation After cryopreservation , embryo survival , in terms of hatching blastocysts , was statistically different -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- between in vitro-CTR -LRB- 32.71 \u00b1 6.26 % ; 87/266 -RRB- and in vitro + MVs -LRB- 43.09 \u00b1 5.73 % ; 78/181 -RRB- , respectively -LRB- Table 1 -RRB- . Percentage of pregnancy after embryo transfer On day 28 -LRB- D28 -RRB- , the pregnancy rate was statistically different -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- after embryo transfer of fresh embryos , 36.67 % -LRB- 11/30 cows -RRB- for in vitro-CTR and 66.67 % -LRB- 20/30 cows -RRB- for in vitro + MVs . There was also a statistically significant difference -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- in pregnancy rate for transfer of cryopreserved embryos : 10 % -LRB- 3/30 -RRB- for in vitro-CTR embryos versus 36.67 % -LRB- 11/30 -RRB- for in vitro + MV -LRB- Table 1 -RRB- . On day 70 -LRB- D70 -RRB- , the pregnancy rate decreased to 3.34 % for both fresh and cryopreserved in vitro-CTR embryos , while for in vitro + MVs embryos no late embryo mortality was recorded for either fresh or cryopreserved embryos -LRB- Table 1 -RRB- . In vivo embryo production After superovulation in three cows , 34 embryos were collected , with an average of 11.36 \u00b1 1.42 embryos . miRNA data analysis Nine samples were sequenced , each from a pool of 10 embryos , belonging to three groups -LRB- in vivo , in vitro-CTR and in vitro + MVs -RRB- -LRB- see Supplementary File S1 for statistics -RRB- . About 35 million reads were sequenced for each condition and replicate , 1 % of which were assigned to miRNAs . In total , 294 miRNAs were identified at least in triplicate in one group -LRB- 197 Bos taurus bta-miRNAs , 52 novel and 45 novel homologous to related species -RRB- . Principal Component Analysis -LRB- PCA -RRB- on these miRNAs showed that in vivo produced embryos were clearly different from in vitro produced embryos -LRB- PC1 -RRB- . The two groups of embryos obtained following in vitro culture clustered close to one another , but the in vitro + MVs group was closer to in vivo samples -LRB- Fig. 3A -RRB- . The number of miRNAs found to be differentially expressed -LRB- -LRB- DE -RRB- - miRNAs -RRB- in three comparisons -LRB- in vivo vs in vitro + MVs , in vivo vs in vitro-CTR , in vitro-CTR vs in vitro + MVs -RRB- were 15 , 20 and 2 , respectively -LRB- False Discovery Rate -LRB- FDR -RRB- < 0.05 -RRB- -LRB- Supplementary File S2 -RRB- . PCA calculated on DE-miRNAs showed a separation of the three groups with a distinctive miRNA trait -LRB- Fig. 3B -RRB- . PC1 , which explains 62.4 % of the variance , clearly separates in vivo and in vitro produced embryos even if MV addition seems to ameliorate the effect of in vitro production . Three DE-miRNAs -LRB- bta-miR-10a , bta-miR-486 and bta-let7-e -RRB- are shared among the in vivo and the two in vitro groups -LRB- Fig. 3 -RRB- . Finally , the expression of two miRNAs -LRB- miR 130a , miR-181b -RRB- differed significantly between in vitro embryos obtained with or without MVs -LRB- Fig. 4 -RRB- . miRNA validation by quantitative polymerase chain reaction -LRB- q-PCR -RRB- Five miRNAs -LRB- bta-let-7a-5p , bta-miR-130a , bta-miR-34a , bta-miR-423-5p , bta-miR-486 -RRB- were validated by q-PCR using two reference smallRNAs -LRB- SNORD95 and RNU6 -RRB- . The fold change among three groups -LRB- in vivo , in vitro-CTR and in vitro + MVs -RRB- were compared with those of miRNA sequencing -LRB- Supplementary File S3 -RRB- . qPCR confirmed smallRNA-seq pattern : bta-let-7a-5p was validated with both smallRNA references , whereas bta-miR-130a and bta-miR-34a were validated with RNU6 and bta-miR-423-5p , bta-miR-486 with SNORD95 . Discussion In recent years , the roles of EVs in biological processes such as implantation and embryo development8 have been widely investigated . The supplementation of in vitro embryo culture medium with bovine amniotic derived MVs has been shown to improve the quality of bovine embryos11 . To understand the effects of amniotic-derived MVs on bovine embryos and their potential influence on embryo implantation , we performed a further in vitro and in vivo study . The results show that the hatching percentage of cryopreserved in vitro + MVs embryos is higher compared to the in vitro-CTR embryos . In addition , in vivo , the D28 recipient pregnancy rates are higher with both fresh and cryopreserved in vitro + MVs embryos compared in vitro-CTR embryos . At D70 , late embryonic loss was found only in both fresh and cryopreserved in vitro-CTR embryos , while no late embryo mortality was recorded in in vitro \u2212 MV embryos . From these results , it can be concluded that the MVs had a positive effect on both the survival of frozen/thawed embryos and their implantation rates . We do not know how the MVs improve the implantation efficiency . It is likely that MV supplementation reduces apoptosis11 and degeneration and this assumption could explain the higher hatching rate in cryopreserved in vitro + MVs embryos and the higher recipient pregnancy rate in vivo with both fresh and cryopreserved in vitro + MVs embryos compared to in vitro-CTR embryos . Since it has recently been proposed that miRNAs could serve as molecular markers of blastocyst quality20 ,22,23 , we wanted to investigate whether miRNAs could be related to the success of hatching and implantation . To this end , embryo miRNA profiling in the different embryo culture conditions -LRB- in vitro , with or without MVs , and in vivo -RRB- was performed . It is known that messenger RNA and miRNA can be transferred from spermatozoa to the oocyte at fertilization24 and that altered spermatozoan mRNA profiles could influence in vitro fertilization25 . In order to minimize the bull effect , ejaculate from a single bull of proven fertility was used . To our knowledge , this is the first study reporting the complete miRNA profiling of blastocysts fertilized in vitro compared with those collected in vivo . Few studies have investigated the importance of specific miRNAs in successful embryonic development . For example , a consistent downregulation of miR-199-5p was seen in murine embryos fertilized in vitro compared with those fertilized in vivo26 . Our results show that miRNAs represent only a small proportion of the total small non-coding RNA -LRB- ncRNA -RRB- content in blastocysts . SmallRNA profiling of pools of 30 bovine blastocysts using deep sequencing showed that the vast majority of reads mapped to ncRNAs other than miRNAs , as previously demonstrated by Pasquariello et al. 27 . Similarly , only about 1 % of the total reads sequenced in our experimental conditions was assigned to miRNAs . In our work , the miRNA profiles of the three groups under study -LRB- in vivo , in vitro-CTR and in vitro + MVs -RRB- are different , and each group shows a distinctive miRNA trait . In the DE-miRNAs PCA , it is interesting to note that PC1 , accounting for 62.4 % of the variance , clearly separates in vivo and in vitro groups , and that three miRNAs were commonly up-regulated in in vivo vs in vitro produced embryos : let-7e , miR-10a and miR-486 . miRNAs were also validated by qPCR . It is reported that the let-7 family members are essential for correct blastocyst maturation28 and these are differently expressed in mouse uterus during the peri-implantation period29 . Specifically , in rats , let-7a expression was observed to change temporally and spatially in the uterus , playing an important role in blastocyst implantation and decidualization and in the mutual relationship between the receptive uterus and competent blastocyst29 . In addition , the miRNA let-7e is also involved in embryo implantation . However , there are conflicting data on the extent of expression of the let-7 family members , as downregulation in 5-aza-dC treated mouse pronuclear embryos -LRB- with inhibition of DNA methylation -RRB- alters embryo development30 . On the other hand , the forced-expression of let-7a in dormant mouse blastocysts , activated by estradiol , reduces blastocyst attachment and outgrowth in vivo and in vitro , providing the first evidence that the let-7 family is involved in regulating the implantation process31 . Our results show that let-7 family members are more strongly expressed in in vivo - than in in vitro produced blastocysts which contradicts the results of Liu et al. 31 but it is likely that the expression of let-7a in murine blastocysts was excessively forced -LRB- about 100 times above physiological conditions -RRB- , negatively affecting the implantation competency of the activated blastocysts . MiR-10a is encoded in the Hox clusters upstream of HoxB4 gene and has been shown to target several HOX transcripts , suggesting a co-regulation with the neighbouring Hox genes and a role as a developmental regulator32 . In cultured embryos , ethanol treatment up-regulates miR-10a in mice and induces major fetal teratogenesis33 . Mis-regulation of miR-10a caused by ethanol exposure is , therefore , lethal for the embryo and fetus . Interestingly , co-incubation with folic acid blocks ethanol-induced teratogenesis , down-regulates miR-10a and improves the blastocyst development33 . Conversely , we found a higher level of miR-10a in in vivo vs in vitro blastocysts , suggesting that a minimum level of miR-10a is necessary for correct blastocyst maturation . To date , there is no information in the literature regarding miR-486 apart from data concerning the significantly increased expression of miR-486-3p in the mouse placental villus during the peri-implantation period34 . The higher expression of this miRNA in in vivo blastocysts compared to those produced in vitro , shown for the first time in our study , highlights the importance of this miRNA for correct blastocyst growth . These findings , however , need further investigation . Our data show that in vitro embryo production modifies miRNA content in the blastocyst . The supplementation of culture medium with MVs seems to partially change the miRNA profile of in vitro + MVs embryos compared to in vitro-CTR embryos . Two miRNAs were significantly different between in vitro embryos obtained in the two conditions : miR-130a and miR-181b , which undergo up-regulation in in vitro-CTR embryos . These miRNAs were previously reported to regulate blastocyst development and embryo implantation . Mir-130a expression was observed to increase linearly during the 1 -- 8 cell stage , but drastically decrease in the blastocyst , suggesting that miR-130a has a critical role in gene regulation in early bovine embryo development18 ,35 . MicroRNAs are also involved in fetal-maternal crosstalk . A uterine down-regulation of expression of miRNA-181 family members is associated with the onset of embryo implantation that occurs in mice on the evening of day 4-post coitus36 . Our results suggest that these two miRNAs have to be down-regulated during embryo development . However , in vitro culture without MVs induces up-regulation of these two miRNAs . There was over expression of miR-181a in degenerate bovine embryos compared to healthy bovine embryos37 and mir-181b , and with miR-191-5p , were the miRNA most released into the conditioned medium by human embryos38 . Our data on in vitro-CTR embryos confirm this up-regulation and demonstrate that MV supplementation modifies miRNA expression ameliorating the quality of in vitro produced embryos . Conclusion In conclusion , small RNA profiling showed a different miRNA expression between in vivo and in vitro produced blastocysts . This is likely to be due to epigenetic effects related to the different environmental culture conditions . Addition of amniotic MVs during in vitro embryo production seems to influence the developmental capacity and implantation potential of the embryos and regulate the expression of specific miRNAs -LRB- miR-130a and miR-181b -RRB- that regulate blastocyst development ; these effects are involved in the success of embryo implantation , probably improving cross-talking between embryo and endometrium . Further studies relating to other cargo components of the MVs are required , but in the meantime , these results could contribute to optimization of bovine embryo culture methods , and suggest new ways to improve human embryo culture technique . Materials and Methods Chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical -LRB- Milan , Italy -RRB- unless stated otherwise , and tissue culture plastic dishes were purchased from Euroclone -LRB- Milan , Italy -RRB- . Ovaries were collected from Holstein Friesian cows slaughtered in a slaughterhouse -LRB- INALCA , Ospedaletto Lodigiano , Lodi , Italy -RRB- under national food hygiene regulations . Allanto-amniotic membranes were obtained at term from normal pregnancies and parturitions from three Holstein Friesian cows -LRB- Bos taurus -RRB- . All procedures were performed according to approved animal care and use protocols of the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano ethics committee -LRB- OPBA 118_2017 -RRB- and to good veterinary practice for animal welfare as to European directive 2010/63/UE . Moreover , written informed consent was obtained from farmers at the beginning of the study . Amniotic cell isolation and culture Allanto-amniotic membranes were collected and processed following a standard protocol as previously reported21 . Briefly , the allanto-amnion were kept at 4 \u00b0C and processed within 12 h . The amniotic membrane was separated from its juxtaposed allantois and cut into small pieces -LRB- about 9 cm2 each -RRB- that were digested with 0.93 mg/ml collagenase type I and 20 mg/ml DNAse -LRB- Roche , Mannheim , Germany -RRB- for approximately 3 h at 38.5 \u00b0C . Debris were removed using a 100 mm cell strainer and mobilized cells were collected by centrifugation at 200 \u00d7 g for 10 min . Amniotic cells were cultured in a medium composed of HG-DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum -LRB- FCS -RRB- , 1 % penicillin -LRB- 100 UI/mL -RRB- -- streptomycin -LRB- 100 mg/mL -RRB- , 0.25 mg/mL amphotericin B and 2 mM L-glutamine at 38.5 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2 until passage -LRB- P -RRB- 3 . Amniotic cell characterization by reverse transcription-PCR analysis Some mesenchymal -LRB- CD29 , CD44 , CD105 , CD166 -RRB- , pluripotent -LRB- Oct-4 and c-Myc -RRB- and haematopoietic -LRB- CD34 , CD14 -RRB- markers were evaluated by RT-PCR analysis at P3 . Expression of MHC-I and MHC-II was also evaluated . GAPDH was employed as a reference gene . Equine-specific oligonucleotide primers and conventional PCR were the same ones used for the standard characterization of these cells as reported by Corradetti et al. 21 . Microvesicle isolation Amniotic cells at P3 at confluence were cultured for one night in a serum-free medium -LRB- Ultraculture , Lonza , Milan , Italy -RRB- . The microvesicle isolation was performed according to the protocol of Perrini et al. 11 . Briefly , the culture media from three amniotic membranes was collected , pooled , and centrifuged at 3500 \u00d7 g for 20 min to remove cellular debris . Then , MVs were obtained by ultra-centrifuging the pooled medium at 100,000 \u00d7 g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C -LRB- Beckman Coulter Optima L - 100 K -RRB- . The pellet was washed in serum-free medium 199 containing N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-ethanesulfonic acid -LRB- HEPES -RRB- 25 mM and ultra-centrifuged again under the same conditions . The pellet of MVs was split for MV analysis or use in the in vitro study . Measurements of MVs As described by Bruno et al. 39 , size and concentration of MVs were evaluated by the NanoSight LM10 instrument -LRB- Nanoparticle tracking analysis , NTA , Nano-Sight Ltd. , Amesbury , U.K. -RRB- , which permits discrimination of microparticles less than 1 \u00b5m in diameter . In vitro embryo production The in vitro embryo production is a standard protocol composed of three steps : collection of oocytes and their in vitro maturation , in vitro fertilization , and in vitro culture of embryos . In our laboratory , these steps are standardized and performed according to the protocol of Perrini et al. 11 and Lange-Consiglio et al. 40 . Collection of oocytes and in vitro maturation -LRB- IVM -RRB- Ovaries were collected from slaughtered Holstein-Friesian cows -LRB- Bos Taurus -RRB- with unknown history -LRB- age , genealogy , and physiological status -RRB- . Ovaries were transported to the laboratory in sterile saline solution -LRB- 0.9 % NaCl -RRB- supplemented with 150 mg/L kanamycin and maintained at 30 \u00b0C . Oocytes were retrieved by aspiration of 3 -- 5 mm diameter follicles with 18 G needles . Cumulus -- oocyte complexes -LRB- COCs -RRB- were selected and washed three times in pre-incubated TCM 199-Hepes buffered supplemented with 10 % FCS . In vitro maturation was performed under standard condition for 24 h in TCM 199 Earl 's Salt medium supplemented with 10 % FCS , 5 \u03bcg / mL LH -LRB- Lutropin , Vetoquinol , France -RRB- , 0.5 \u03bcg / mL FSH -LRB- Folltropin , Vetoquinol -RRB- , 0.2 mM sodium pyruvate , 5 \u03bcg / mL gentamycin and 1 mg/mL estradiol 17\u03b2 . Cultures were performed in 70 \u03bcL droplets -LRB- up to 20 oocytes/droplet -RRB- of the medium under mineral oil , at 38.5 \u00b0C in 5 % CO2 . In vitro fertilization -LRB- IVF -RRB- In vitro fertilization was performed in Tyrode 's - albumin-lactate-pyruvate -LRB- TALP -RRB- medium containing 2 mM penicillamine , 1 mM hypotaurine , 250 mM epinephrine , 20 \u03bcg / mL heparin , 114 mM NaCl , 3.2 mM KCl , 0.4 mM NaH2PO4 , 10 mM sodium lactate , 25 mM NaHCO3 , 0.5 mM MgCl2-6H20 , 2.0 mM CaCl2-2H2O , 6 mg/mL bovine serum albumin -LRB- BSA , -RRB- , 5 \u03bcl / mL gentamicin , 0.2 mM sodium pyruvate . Frozen-thawed semen from a single bull of proven fertility was prepared by Percoll density gradient -LRB- Amersham Pharmacia Biotec -RRB- -LRB- 45/90 % -RRB- . Semen was thawed at 37 \u00b0C for 30 s , placed on the top of the Percoll gradient and centrifuged for 30 min at 300 \u00d7 g . The semen suspension was diluted in the appropriate volume of fertilization medium to obtain a final concentration of 107 spermatozoa per mL . An aliquot of 10 \u00b5L of semen was co-incubated with matured oocytes for 18 h at 38.5 \u00b0C in 5 % CO2 . Cultures were performed in 70 \u03bcl droplets -LRB- up to 20 oocytes/droplet -RRB- of the medium under mineral oil . At the end of gamete co-culture , cumulus cells were completely removed and cumulus-free presumptive zygotes were randomly transferred into different culture systems and cultured up to day 7 . In vitro culture -LRB- IVC -RRB- The standard medium for IVC was synthetic oviductal fluid with amino acids -LRB- SOFaa ; Holm et al. 1999 -RRB- composed of 1.1 M NaCl , 72 mM KCl , 12 mM KH2PO4 , 7.4 mM MgSO4 , 50 mM DL-lactate , 250 mM NaHCO3 , 260 mM phenol red , 100 mM sodium pyruvate , 178 mM CaCl2-2H2O , 125 mM Hepes sodium salt , 30.8 mM glutamine , 500 mM glycine , 84.2 mM alanine , 100X MEM non-essential , 100X BME , 2.8 mM Myo-Inositol , 340 mM trisodium citrate , 2 % FCS , 0.005 gr/mL BSA , 0.2 mM sodium pyruvate , 5 \u00b5L / mL gentamicin . At the beginning of the culture in SOFaa , presumptive zygotes were randomly assigned to a control group -LRB- CTR , no supplementation -RRB- , or to group in which SOFaa was supplemented with 100 \u00d7 106 EVs/ml as previously studied by Perrini et al. 11 after dose-response curve . In vitro culture was performed for 7 days in 5 % O2 , 5 % CO2 and 90 % N2 in a humidified atmosphere at 38.5 \u00b0C . Cultures were performed in 70 \u03bcl droplets -LRB- up to 20 oocytes/droplet -RRB- of the medium . In the standard protocol , the medium is renewed on days 3 and 6 during the culture period . In this study , to avoid stress to the embryos and to allow the action of MVs , the medium was renewed on days 3 and 5 , and the day fifth was chosen to add MVs to SOF11 . SOF only was also added to the control group on the same days . On day 7 , blastocysts from the control and MV groups were retrieved from the IVC drops . One set of grade 1 blastocysts , according to International Embryo Technology Society41 classification system , either fresh or cryopreserved was used for embryo transfer . Another set -LRB- ten blastocysts for each group -RRB- was washed in sterile PBS and immediately cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen for genomic study . Cryopreservation of blastocysts and warming Excellent quality blastocysts collected on day 7 -LRB- B7 -RRB- were cryopreserved with ethylene glycol 1.5 M using a standard slow freezing curve . Thawing was accomplished by removing the cryoprotectant by washing in PBS supplemented with 0.2 % BSA . Embryos were cultured in SOFaa and their in vitro survival and growth were evaluated for the 3 days before hatching . Recipient animals One hundred and twenty Holstein-Friesian cows were enrolled in this study as recipients of an in vitro produced embryo . Written informed consent was obtained from the owners and the cows were used in accordance to the approved ethics application . No adverse outcomes were observed during synchronization , embryo transfer or pregnancy . Synchronization of oestrus , embryo transfer and pregnancy diagnosis Recipient heifers were synchronized by a luteolytic dose of Prostaglandin PGF2-\u03b1 -LRB- Estrumate , Schering Plough Animal Health , Segrate , MI , Italia -RRB- so that they displayed oestrus on the same day in which the in vitro insemination was performed -LRB- termed day 0 -RRB- . Only animals with a clinically detectable and well-developed corpus luteum -LRB- CL -RRB- , received one fresh or one cryopreserved in vitro-CTR embryo or one fresh or cryopreserved in vitro + MV embryo 7 days after oestrus . Embryo transfer was performed into the uterine horn ipsilateral to the CL . On day 28 after transfer , and on day 70 , pregnancy status was established by ultrasound . In vivo embryo production Three Holstein-Friesian cows , 3 to 4 years old , with a history of normal fertility , were enrolled in this study . After detection of a well-developed CL , the animals were treated with a luteolytic PGF2-\u03b1 dose and , nine days after induced estrus , the cows were superovulated with a combination of FSH and LH -LRB- Pluset , Calier SA , Barcelona , Spain -RRB- at the total dose of 1,000 U.I. in ten decreasing doses for 5 days -LRB- 3 , 3 , 2.5 , 2.5 , 2 , 2 , 1.5 , 1.5 , 1 , 1 ml -RRB- . The cows were inseminated twice , at 12 hour interval , starting 12 h after onset of oestrus , with the same cryopreserved semen . Seven days after artificial insemination , embryos were collected under epidural anesthesia by procaine hydrochloride -LRB- IZO , Brescia , Italy -RRB- . The uteri were non-surgically flushed with Ringer 's solution -LRB- Terumo , Tokyo , Japan -RRB- containing 0.1 % fetal calf serum -LRB- FCS -RRB- through a multi-eye 16-French embryo collection catheter -LRB- Nipro , Osaka , Japan -RRB- . Collected embryos were counted and evaluated following the IETS criteria . Only grade 1 blastocysts were used for genomic study , after washing in sterile PBS and immediate cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen . RNA isolation Samples for RNA isolation were obtained from pools of 10 embryos each for each condition -LRB- in vivo , in vitro-CTR and in vitro + MVs -RRB- . Total RNA was isolated by NucleoSpin1 miRNA kit -LRB- Macherey-Nagel , Germany -RRB- following the protocol , in combination with TRIzol -LRB- Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA -RRB- lysis with large and small RNA in a single fraction -LRB- total RNA -RRB- , with few modifications : the final step of RNA elution from column was performed using a minimum amount of nuclease free water -LRB- 14 \u00b5l -RRB- . Quality and concentration of RNA were determined using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer -LRB- Santa Clara , CA , USA -RRB- . The isolated RNAs were stored at \u2212 80 \u00b0C until use . Library preparation and sequencing Nine libraries were obtained working in triplicate for each condition -LRB- in vivo , in vitro-CTR and vitro + MVs -RRB- . Libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Small RNA Library Preparation kit , according to manufacturer 's instructions -LRB- Illumina -RRB- .

Concentration and quality of libraries were assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer prior sequencing on a single lane of Illumina Hiseq . 3000 -LRB- San Diego , CA , USA -RRB- . miRNA data analysis MiRNA analysis was performed as previously reported42 : after quality checking with FastQC -LRB- http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ -RRB- and trimming with Trimmomatic43 , Illumina sequences were input to miRDeep244 for miRNA detection and discovery . Bos taurus miRNAs available at MirBase -LRB- http://www.mirbase.org/ -RRB- were used to identify known miRNAs . Known miRNAs from related species -LRB- sheep , horse , and goat -RRB- available at MirBase were also input into miRDeep2 to support classification of novel miRNAs . The miRDeep2 quantifier module was used to quantify expression and retrieve counts for the detected known and novel miRNAs . Differential expression analyses between samples were run with the Bioconductor edgeR package -LRB- version 2.4 -RRB- -LRB- false discovery rate -LSB- FDR -RSB- < 0.05 -RRB- 45 . MicroRNA cluster analysis was performed with Genesis46 . miRNA validation by quantitative polymerase chain reaction -LRB- q-PCR -RRB- Samples of isolated RNA were pooled to obtain three samples representing each treatment -LRB- in vivo , in vitro-CTR and in vitro + MVs -RRB- that were retro-transcribed using the miScript II RT Kit following the manufacturer 's instructions -LRB- Qiagen , Inc. , Valencia , CA , USA -RRB- . Quantitative real-time -LRB- qPCR -RRB- and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction -LRB- RT-PCR -RRB- was carried out as previously reported47 with some modification . cDNAs were firstly preamplified using miScript preAMP kit -LRB- Qiagen , Inc. -RRB- following the manufacturer 's instructions except that miScript Primers were used instead of miScript PreAMP Primer Mix . Pre-amplification reactions were done in 10 \u00b5l volumes containing 5x miScript PreAMP Buffer -LRB- 2 \u03bcl -RRB- , HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase -LRB- 0.8 -RRB- \u03bcl , miScript Primer -LRB- 0.4 \u03bcl -RRB- , RNase-free water -LRB- 4.4 \u03bcl -RRB- , miScript PreAMP Universal Primer -LRB- 0.4 \u03bcl -RRB- , template cDNA -LRB- 2 \u03bcl -RRB- . Each amplified cDNA was quantified using QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System -LRB- Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA -RRB- with miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit -LRB- Qiagen , Inc. -RRB- . Reactions were performed in 10 \u00b5l volumes containing 1 \u03bcl of each miscript Primer and 1 \u03bcl mL of universal reverse primer -LRB- Qiagen , Inc. -RRB- , 2 \u03bcl cDNA , 1 \u03bcl RNase-free water and 5 \u03bcl QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer 's protocols . The same specific miScript Primers were used in both pre-amplification and real-time reactions . The primers used for bta-let-7a-5p , bta-miR-130a , bta-miR-34a , bta-miR-423-5p , bta-miR-486 were Hs_let-7a_2 , Hs_miR-130a_1 , Hs_miR-34a_1 , Hs_miR-423-5p_1 , Hs_miR-486_1 miScript Primer Assay -LRB- Qiagen , Inc. -RRB- , respectively . For the normalization , the references U6 small nuclear RNA Hs_RNU6-2_11 and SNORD95 small nucleolar RNA , C/D box 95 miScript Primer -LRB- Qiagen , Inc. -RRB- were used . Negative controls using water in place of sample were performed alongside each reaction . Reactions were run using the cycling parameters of 95 \u00b0C for 15 min , 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 15 s , 55 \u00b0C for 30 s and 70 \u00b0C for 30 s. Relative expression levels for each treatment were calculated using the 2 \u2212 \u0394\u0394Ct method48 . Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA with non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis test and for pregnancy rate by chi square .

When Netflix announced the fictional entrepreneurs of Grace & Frankie were taking their latest product to ABC 's Shark Tank , I was ecstatic . The ingenious co-inventors of the arthritis-friendly vibrator Vybrant and farm-to-vagina organic Yam Lube , Grace Hansen and Frankie Bergstein -LRB- played by Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin -RRB- are a perfect match for the business reality show . They 've got story , style , chemistry , zero production prospects -- it 's what Shark Tank stars are made of . Would Barbara Corcoran sweep in with an angel offer ? Would Lori Greiner and Mr. Wonderful spar over the numbers ? Would Mark Cuban make a completely irrelevant sports metaphor ? It 's the best crossover event Netflix has ever attempted , and an asset to everyone involved . On Wednesday , Netflix dropped all 13 episodes of Grace & Frankie Season 6 , and my questions were answered in a glorious 27-minute installment , aptly named `` The Tank . '' It 's the best crossover event Netflix has ever attempted , and an asset to everyone involved . Seeking a $ 200,000 investment for 10 % equity , Grace and Frankie entered the Shark Tank promoting their latest invention Rise Up , a `` sleek and sexy '' toilet with hydraulics capable of hoisting the user off its seat . The prototype was inspired by Grace 's central emotional arc of the season . After moving in with her new husband Nick -LRB- Peter Gallagher -RRB- , Grace struggled to reconcile her needs as an 80-year-old woman with her status as the new wife of a billionaire . In episode 2 `` The Rescue , '' her bad knee seized up while she was on the can , and to avoid telling her husband , Grace called Frankie to quite literally rescue her ass . 10 episodes of secrecy and shenanigans later -LRB- including the toilet briefly getting involved with a SoCal robbery scheme ? -RRB- , Grace , Frankie , and the Rise Up were on Shark Tank . Shark Tank brings the best out of Grace & Frankie ... As the reality series ' earworm theme played , my knuckles went white . Grace and Frankie busted through the soundstage doors , and put the merchandising fate of Rise Up in the hands of these ruthless critics -- less concerned with bottoms than with bottom lines . My favorite comfort series was colliding with the dastardly world of primetime dream-shaming . I was loving it and losing it all at once . Over the past 5 years , Grace and Frankie have become some of streaming 's most beloved and relatable characters . We 've watched as this dynamic duo has taken on many of the very real challenges that come with aging , from medical scares and love lost to the terrifying nature of change . In Season 6 , this theme rippled throughout the cast as Sol grappled with a major surgery , Robert took on an extra job as a Lyft driver , and some of the series ' most beloved couples called it quits . ... and Grace & Frankie brings the best out of Shark Tank . Since I already loved these two saleswomen who were jumping in with ABC 's Sharks , I was filled with dread . What if my girls got hurt ? What if they never recovered ? What if this was the one stunt they just could n't pull off ? To avoid spoiling the season finale , I wo n't tell you how their pitch goes . But I will say : Shark Tank brings the best out of Grace & Frankie , and -LRB- much to my surprise -RRB- Grace & Frankie brings the best out of Shark Tank . The cutthroat setting made Grace and Frankie only more lovable -- allowing Fonda to put her formidable character through some uneasy emotional paces and Tomlin to pantomime the hell out of being stuck on the commode . As performers , they absolutely crush the opportunity to spread their wings -LRB- fins ? -RRB- and take on the Tank . As for the all-star investors , the episode takes a little bit of the bite out of their typically intimidating personas . The Sharks are clearly rattled by being anyone but themselves on-camera . It 's a cute look at a bunch of alleged tough guys who have been placed very far out of their element . Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban seems particularly stressed by the whole thing , and understandably so considering he takes on more lines and plot than any of his co-stars . -LRB- Anytime he has to react negatively to Fonda , it 's clearly a struggle . -RRB- Guest shark Rohan Oza , who has been appearing on Shark Tank only since Season 9 , is easily the most comfortable , although Barbara Corcoran and Kevin O'Leary tie for a close second . Lori Greiner -- charming as always . It 's a cute look at a bunch of alleged tough guys who have been placed very far out of their element . It should also be said , there is something delightful about seeing a network show comfortably collaborating with a streaming site -- melding two worlds often kept apart by programming schedules , financial barriers , and industry competition . Suffice to say , Grace & Frankie Season 6 nails what could have been a gimmicky play , further cementing their role as one of the most consistently excellent series on Netflix . With just one season left in the Hansen-and-Bergstein adventure , it seems that creators can cross `` swimming with Sharks '' off Grace and Frankie 's to-do list . Grace & Frankie Season 6 is now streaming on Netflix .", "url": "https://mashable.com/article/grace-and-frankie-season-6-shark-tank/", "kws": ["Netflix", "stars", "Shark^^Tank", "Lily^^Tomlin", "Jane^^Fonda", "Frankie^^Bergstein", "streaming", "Grace^^Hansen", "ABC", "primetime^^dream-shaming", "Lori^^Greiner", "spoilers", "Sharks", "relatable^^characters", "mild^^spoilers", "style", "plot", "bottoms", "fins", "Barbara^^Corcoran^^sweep"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_TV": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_TV_ShowsPrograms": 1.0000100135803223}}}

Data published by Public Health England -LRB- PHE -RRB- shows HIV transmission is continuing to fall , with the number of people who are unaware they have the virus also decreasing . Gay and bisexual men have experienced the most dramatic decline in new infections , with rates falling by 73 per cent . In 2014 , there were an estimated 2,300 HIV transmissions among gay and bisexual men , dropping to 800 in 2018 . Meanwhile , the number of gay and bisexual men who are living undiagnosed with HIV has also halved since 2014 from an estimated 7,000 in 2014 to 3,600 in 2018 . Health Secretary Matt Hancock said : `` I feel very strongly that we must end HIV transmission . `` HIV has brought untold hurt and suffering to so many so it is encouraging to see transmissions continue to fall across the UK . `` We are well on our way towards our ambition of zero HIV transmissions by 2030 and we should be rightly proud of the incredible progress we have already made . '' The continued decline in the virus has been attributed to the success of preventive measures , including the use of condoms , testing in a wide range of settings , starting antiretroviral therapy -LRB- ART -RRB- as soon as possible if positive and the availability of Pre-exposure Prophylaxis -LRB- PrEP -RRB- for those who are negative . Dr Noel Gill , head of sexually transmitted infections and HIV at PHE , said : `` We are well on our way to reaching the goal of eliminating HIV transmission by 2030 , with the rapid fall in HIV transmission continuing in 2018 and nearly all of those diagnosed receiving treatment that prevents onward transmission . `` Testing is a key part of the UK 's success . If you have HIV you can benefit from life-saving treatments that also prevent further transmission of the virus . `` Certain groups of people are at higher HIV risk and are advised to have regular tests , including men and women who have had unprotected sex with new or casual partners from countries where HIV is common , who should test every year , and men who have sex with men . '' According to Terrence Higgins Trust -LRB- THT -RRB- -- a British charity that campaigns for and provides services relating to HIV and sexual health -- HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus , with ` immunodeficiency ' referring to the weakening of the immune system by the virus . While HIV has been passed on between humans for many decades it was only identified in the early 1980s . The charity adds that HIV can be transmitted through body fluids such as blood , semen , vaginal fluid , anal mucus and breast milk . If you are concerned that you might have HIV , THT recommends asking your GP for a test .

On the other hand , there are conflicting results regarding the decreased sperm DNA integrity in men with high body mass index -LRB- BMI -RRB- . Objective We aimed at the present systematic review and meta-analysis at evaluating the association between BMI and SDF . Methods We searched databases of Medline , Embase , Scopus , and Web of Science up to May 2019 , to identify observational studies that assessed the associations between BMI and SDF . BMI was classified , according to the standard BMI classifications , into six categories including underweight -LRB- < 18.5 -RRB- , normal weight -LRB- 18.5 -- 24.99 -RRB- , overweight -LRB- 25 -- 29.99 -RRB- , class I obesity -LRB- 30 -- 34.99 -RRB- , class II obesity -LRB- 35 -- 39.99 -RRB- , and class III obesity -LRB- \u2265 40 -RRB- . Standardized mean differences -LRB- SMDs -RRB- and 95 % confidence intervals -LRB- CIs -RRB- of SDF were calculated by using a random-effects model for BMI categories . Results The initial extensive literature search yielded 33,739 potentially relevant articles -LRB- 3,917 from Medline , 781 from Embase , 12,685 from Scopus , and 9,348 from Web of Science -RRB- . Fourteen studies -LRB- nine cross-sectional , four cohort , and one case -- control studies -RRB- , with a total number of 8,255 participants , were included in the meta-analysis . Finally , three studies reported higher SDF levels in obese men -LRB- BMI = 30 -- 34.99 -RRB- compared with normal-weight men -LRB- BMI < 25 -RRB- -LRB- SMD : 0.23 , 95 % CI : 0.01 , 0.46 , P = 0.05 , I2 = 0 % -RRB- , but there was no difference between other categories . Conclusions There is insufficient data to demonstrate a positive association between BMI and SDF . Our findings provide a rationale for conducting further cohort studies for evaluation of the association between BMI and SDF , considering potential confounders . Access options References 1 .

Michelle De Feo wants to travel to Washington in the US where she hopes medics will alleviate some of her life-changing symptoms . The 28-year-old , from Colchester , Essex , was diagnosed with the disease almost a year after complaining of dizziness and fatigue , reports Essex Live . And Michelle , who grew up on a farm , believes she may have been bitten by a tick in 2016 when she was surrounded by horses , deer and woodland . She has now taken the unusual approach to sell nude photos on social media to raise the # 6,000 she needs for the flight and treatment . But she admitted it has n't gone down well with her family . `` My dad found out and he was a little bit upset . He said he felt sad that I was doing it , '' she said . `` My mum is alright with it and she said it 's not like you are not a prostitute . She said it 's kind of empowering if you are a woman in your situation . '' Michelle says she posts ` tasteful ' photos , with many suiting fetishes , for example a selection of feet photos and users have to pay to subscribe to her account to see them . So far , she has raised # 600 through her nudes and # 800 through her GoFundMe page . She hopes that sharing her story will not only help her raise the money she needs , but it will also raise awareness of Lyme disease . The bacterial infection can be spread to humans by infected ticks . It is easy to treat if diagnosed early . Explaining how she thinks she was infected by the tick , Michelle said : `` I was always looking after horses out in shorts and always in the barn . `` We used to get deers come up to the door too , we never touched them though . `` I just did n't feel right at all . I was getting lethargic and feeling so tired and then I got a rash on my arm . I did n't think anything of it until I got really bad . I felt like I had the flu and got really dozy . `` I knew something was wrong . I was getting so tired and so dozy to the point that I could n't stand up . I would just be crying in the bathroom saying something is n't right . `` Then I was peeing out blood and that 's when I went to the walk-in centre for help . '' Michelle sought private medical help where she was tested for Lyme disease . She says the GP said they could n't treat it and all they could do was provide pain killers . `` It was really scary when I knew I had a diagnosis , my mental health was affected , '' Michelle said . `` It 's like you are grieving for your old life . '' For a year after her diagnosis , Michelle was given medication , a strict diet and lots of vitamins . But it was n't long before she relapsed , getting the old symptoms of dizziness and finding blood in her urine again . That was when she visited Washington , heard about an amazing treatment for Lyme disease , and began selling nudes to raise the money to get there . `` I know a lot of people doing it now - there are mums who are struggling to feed their kids doing it , '' she said . `` I 'm going to get judged and my dad gets upset and other family members do . But if you were in my situation you would do anything . '' Michelle says she takes several nudes in one day then posts them gradually . She ca n't take photos every day due to her health as it takes around three hours to get a good set . `` I post all sorts of photos . I used to do bit of modelling of lingerie topless . It 's all quite tasteful stuff , '' she explained . `` I even post foot pictures and fetish stuff . I actually prefer doing fetish stuff because you can keep your clothes on . '' Michelle said she has loads of underwear from her modelling days but she also has an Amazon wishlist so fans can buy her things if they want to see her wear something specific . Reflecting on what she 's doing , Michelle said she believes she `` should n't be doing this '' but thinks it shows `` how desperate '' she is to get her life in order . `` I need to spread awareness as I can and I believe others with Lyme should tell their stories too , '' she said . . Alongside her Lyme disease she was diagnosed with endometriosis . A spokesperson for NHS England and NHS Improvement in the East of England , said : `` Lyme disease can sometimes be difficult to diagnose as symptoms , such as feeling hot and shivery , headaches , aching muscles or feeling sick , can also occur in other conditions . `` If you have been bitten by a tick and feel unwell with flu-like symptoms or develop a circular red rash , you should visit your GP or call NHS 111 .

'' Fresh off of sacrificing himself to save the universe in Avengers : Endgame , Robert Downey Jr. graces our cinemas with his latest movie ` Dolittle ` this weekend . Clearly feeling the goodwill from Iron Man , RDJ decides to employ the strangest accent for his new hero . Dolittle is a perfectly passable family movie in the dumping ground of January movies . It is PG , it is short , and it has a few amusing moments to keep the family entertained on a cold weekend . The new children 's movie tradition of opening with a tragedy is continued in this movie where we learn the backstory of Dolittle . In this version , Dolittle fell in love and married a beautiful adventurer who loved to take risks . Together they rescued many of the animals you see in the trailers and formed a small adventure family . Of course , in order to give this children 's movie stakes , they went out of their way to explain that his wife died and he locked himself in his manor for seven years refusing to interact with any humans so he could never lose anyone again . That is the first 5 minutes , everyone ! Really family-friendly ! Luckily , we move on from dark depressed Dolittle rather quickly as the Queen has fallen ill and needs to him to heal her by finding a mythical plant his wife was looking for when she died . At the same time , a young boy near Dolittle 's manor shoots a squirrel and brings it to him to heal . All three characters go through the motions and soon we have a misfit group of Dolittle , the boy , and several animals boarding a ship to find the plant . One of the aspects of the movie that really clicks is the banter between the animals . Rami Malek 's Gorilla , Kumail Nanjiani 's Ostrich , and John Cena 's Polar Bear are particular standouts and have some truly enjoyable moments together . The CGI is n't as fine-tuned as the Lion King but nothing felt completely out of place or too fake . The adventure moves along at a pretty quick pace with no real-time for any exposition or explanation . In fact , sometimes they skip to the next scene after a quick mention of what they need to do next which I appreciated in a 100-minute movie . They try to cram a lot in but it all seems so inconsequential in the end . The two villains played by Antonio Banderas and Michael Sheen are just here to chew scenery and must have been on set a maximum of five days . The movie culminates with a mystical cave protected by a dragon where the magical fruit is alleged to be hidden . Do we fight this dragon ? Do we do anything interesting ? Yes and No . Dolittle discovers that the dragon is sick with a stomachache because the dragon is constipated . He then in a PG manner pulls armor and weapons out of the dragon 's butt and gets farted on . This act of heroism earns him the fruit . I just want to be clear ... this movie hinges on Robert Downey Jr. pulling items out of a dragon 's butt . My audience was dying laughing during this scene . Like I said before , ` Dolittle ` is a fine two-hour escape for January but I do n't think you 'll be renting or owning it . Other than the dragon butt stuff you probably wo n't remember much of it after leaving the theater either . To gauge the reaction of the target audience I asked my 6-year-old nephew -LRB- who I brought with me -RRB- what his favorite part of the movie was ... His response , `` When the gorilla kicked the tiger in the crotch . '' Have a good week at the movies , everyone !

The Irish beauty , 29 , left little to the imagination in a raunchy shoot ahead of the most romantic day of the year . She wore a stunning black lace bra with harness detailing and matching knickers paired with sexy thigh-high stockings . The brunette bombshell let her bouncy hair fall in curls and sported soft glam make-up to compliment her bronzed skin . `` Valentines is coming @annsummers , '' she wrote alongside her Instagram snap which raked in thousands of likes . Her sexy lingerie snap comes after her partner Curtis Pritchard was accused of cheating on the former grid girl on New Year 's Eve with another woman . Curtis , currently appearing as the receptionist in The Greatest Dancer , was allegedly caught in a passionate clinch with a mystery lady on the dance floor of a High Wycombe nightclub . In a video obtained by The Sun , Curtis is seen with his arms around the woman at O'Neill 's bar . An onlooker told the paper : `` He started embracing her , in the full view of the entire club . It was quite shocking given we all knew he had a girlfriend . `` But in that moment he obviously did n't care who saw him . '' Curtis , 23 , is said to have hit the town after performing in the Dick Whittington pantomime at Wycombe Swan . A representative for Curtis denied allegations that Curtis cheated . Maura and Curtis had spent the Christmas and New Year apart and only reunited on January 1 . Dancing On Ice 's Maura made it clear she was pleased to be back with her man as she shared a raunchy photo of them enjoying a bubble bath together . Days later Maura gave a gushing interview to Heat magazine about her beau and said he was the best boyfriend she 'd ever had . `` Oh my God , he 's just amazing . He 's very , very kind , '' she gushed . `` It was my birthday recently and he was giving me like , presents every day for the entire week before . No boyfriend has ever done anything like that for me before . It was very special and very thoughtful of him . '' Do you have a story to sell ?

Slighter still , one would think , are the chances that two American novels published in the same month would feature sole plane crash survivors -- but that 's what we have here . Make sure you have tissues handy when you read Ann Napolitano 's Dear Edward , a sure-footed tearjerker about the miraculous -- but troubled -- survival of a 12-year-old boy in a crash that kills all of the other 191 people on board a jet bound from Newark to Los Angeles , including his parents and older brother . In Kingdomtide , Rye Curtis ' stirring debut , the survivor is a 72-year-old woman who miraculously walks away from the wreckage of a small plane in Montana 's Bitterroot National Forest , leaving the mangled bodies of the pilot and her husband of 54 years , whose corpse is suspended in a tree down a treacherous cliff . Perhaps even more amazing , she lives another 20 years to tell the heart-pounding tale of how she made it out of the woods . Both novels are about the aftermath of trauma and how survival against the odds profoundly changes these characters ' lives and attitudes . Both protagonists prevail thanks to support from unexpected sources , and in both books , kindness helps steer heartbreaking tales in heartwarming directions . Of the two , Dear Edward is more moving , but Kingdomtide , although less even , is more riveting and surprising . Napolitano , whose most recent novel , A Good Hard Look -LRB- 2011 -RRB- , fictionalized Flannery O'Connor 's last years , has assembled a well-oiled literary machine capable of conveying a panoply of humanity . With each chapter headed by a time stamp , the narrative of Dear Edward interweaves two tracks : a detailed account of the hours leading up to the June 12th , 2013 crash of Flight 2977 , and its aftermath , charting Edward 's long path to healing against a backdrop of unwanted celebrity . The flight portion of our entertainment includes painstaking descriptions of security procedures , boarding , pre-flight instructions , drinks , meals , and much more of the tedious minutiae of air travel . These routine details are clearly intended to ratchet up the sense of impending doom -LRB- although we 've already learned of the crash early in the book -RRB- and to underscore how calamity can upend mundanity in a flash . But they also make Flight 2977 feel at times excruciatingly long for a coast-to-coast trip -- and not always airborne even before the crash . In order to highlight what is lost in the disastrous accident , Napolitano presents capsule portraits of some of the passengers who go down with the Airbus A321 . She has rounded up a deliberate cross-section of Americans , and her omniscient third person narrator switches perspectives between them with the alacrity of a restless passenger clicking through in-flight movie options . Among them are an ailing , cantankerous , wheelchair-bound billionaire and his nurse ; an injured , sexually conflicted black soldier who is leaving the army with a lot more baggage than his colostomy bag ; a Wall Street wunderkind fueled by cocaine who gets off with the sexy first class flight attendant in an aft bathroom ; and Edward 's mother , who 's seated up front in first class in order to work on a screenplay for the new job that 's driving her family 's move to California . Her husband , a mathematician recently denied tenure at Columbia , sits in steerage with Eddie -LRB- as he 's called before his second life -RRB- and his adolescent brother . Dear Edward is in part a tale of survivor guilt , which is fueled by the weight of oppressive , often bizarre expectations on the miracle boy , especially from the families of victims who want him to fulfill their loved ones ' dreams and plans . `` Stop expecting me to have hidden powers , okay ? I 'm not a freaking wizard , '' he explodes at one point . It takes Edward years to learn to live with the aftershocks of the tragedy and absorb the liberating fact that , far from being chosen for a special purpose , his survival was just `` dumb luck . '' Rye Curtis ' 72-year-old retired grade school teacher and librarian , a devout Methodist from small town Texas , is too busy trying to stay alive in the savage Bitterroot Mountains to feel much survivor guilt . Kingdomtide -- part intense adventure story , part morality tale -- is narrated by clear-eyed , refreshingly direct 92-year-old Cloris Waldrip from the assisted living facility in Brattleboro , Vt. , where she 's living out her last years . As she notes , `` A tale belongs to whoever tells it best , '' and this one 's hers . The novel 's title is tied to the August 31 , 1986 crash date , which fell on the first Sunday of Kingdomtide -- an obsolete liturgical season of charity that spanned 13 or 14 Sundays between Pentecost and Advent . Like Dear Edward , Kingdomtide braids two narrative strands that cut like intersecting streams through the valley of this novel , but Cloris ' survival story flows with more force than the chapters featuring the forest ranger who refuses to abandon the search for her . Merlot-sotted , bitterly divorced , foul-mouthed Debra Lewis -- along with her crew of brokenhearted misfits -- truck and trek and drink and spar their way through the rough terrain , picking up occasional signs of life in dual manhunts for Cloris and a suspected child molester who 's wanted by the FBI for the disappearance of a 10-year-old girl . These chapters present a study in profound loneliness , but they can not compete with the novel 's central adventure . One of Kingdomtide 's concerns is with the vagaries of desire , and Curtis does n't stint on sometimes wince-inducing details that are not for the fastidious : Weird sex in a hot-tub from which a dead skunk has just been tossed ; a cross-dresser who dons a bear costume to chase partying teens off his property ; a hermit whose wrists are braceleted with the waistbands of girls ' underwear ; and a crazed local trailer-dweller , `` Goddamn Silk Foot Maggie , '' who fashions sculptures out of garbage , cat skeletons , and `` used tampons for earrings , '' all bound with electrical tape and melted candles . The post-accident , newly open-minded Cloris comments , `` I have come to believe that who or what we desire can not be helped ... And I do not blame people for knowing what they want . I only blame them for doing anything and everything to get it without a thought to the consequences . '' Curtis keeps us turning pages as Cloris confronts bobcats , hypothermia , starvation , icy inundation , and a strange mountain lion who walks backwards . `` It is peculiar how the human spirit endures , '' she comments . `` A person can get used to a situation , even if that situation may have once seemed intolerable . '' Her remark applies to Napolitano 's bereft boy as well . Predicated on cataclysmic , life-changing accidents , Dear Edward and Kingdomtide offer two transportative reads -- and two different takes on the human ability to adapt in order to survive .", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2020/01/16/796658845/kingdomtide-and-dear-edward-two-new-novels-take-on-a-singular-situation", "kws": ["Dear^^Edward", "part^^morality^^tale", "tales", "profound^^loneliness", "books", "husband", "survivor^^guilt", "sole^^survivor", "foul-mouthed^^Debra^^Lewis", "humanity", "kindness", "Weird^^sex", "brokenhearted^^misfits", "capsule^^portraits", "heartwarming^^directions", "Ann^^Napolitano", "hidden^^powers", "Rye^^Curtis", "survivors", "pages"], "text_category": {}}

0.0	{"docid": "0NrNvCWB", "title": "20th Annual Country Music Critics ' Poll : The Comments", "content": "Tanya Tucker , Brandi Carlile and The Highwomen It was an inspiring year for country music writ large : the Ken Burns doc , the triumph of The Highwomen , the fantastic Lil Nas X narrative -LRB- the song 's fun , too -RRB- . In terms of actual recordings , though , it was kinda meh . Miranda and Maren made good records ; ditto Yola and Kelsey Waldon . But the sole classic was The Highwomen , and for the first time in 10-plus years of doing this poll , I had a tough time finding records I loved that felt legit `` country . '' But maybe that 's a good sign -- stylistically and spiritually , the genre feels utterly up for grabs . -- Will Hermes The Highwomen hoopla and co-founder Brandi Carlile 's inspiring achievements have helped spur more `` Year of the Woman '' declarations , but such headlines still imply that women taking charge of their own careers is somehow an anomaly . How many years of chart-topping releases , sold-out tours and awards domination will it take before women are no longer treated as less than equal ? Until country radio actually programs playlists without regard to the artists ' chromosomes ? Until music festivals feature women 's names at all billing levels ? Until women are not forced to sign NDAs , not told to shut up and sing , not called liars when they do speak out ? -- Lynne Margolis Tanya Tucker has never , ever been anybody 's slouch . With a voice like a straight razor , she was shredding big-girl songs as a 13-year-old , blazing a rock trail at 18 and taking a victory lap through mainstream country in her mid-20s . Always brazen , always blazing , she stood out . Today Tucker is no different than she ever was . Thankfully , she 's having the moment she 's always deserved . -- Holly Gleason It 's great to see at least one good old boy and girl still hanging in there . Willie 's 86 years and Tanya 's 61 years seem more like capes fluttering triumphantly behind them than overcoats that drag them down . -- Grant Britt Ken Burns and Country Music History A lot of friends and colleagues had bones to pick with Ken Burns ' Country Music : artists omitted , arguments not made forcefully enough , over-reliance on certain figures -LRB- Johnny Cash -RRB- at the expense of others -LRB- Dolly Parton -RRB- , punting the 21st century . And sure , I wanted more of various things too . But for a 16-hour series aimed at a PBS layfolk audience , I thought it was masterful and on point : compelling narrative storytelling that made country 's multiracial heritage plain , established the central role of women artists , and showed the genre to be as deep , wide and American as jazz , rock , hip-hop -- you name it . -- Will Hermes Ken Burns ' Country Music documentary either taught or reminded listeners that Jimmie Rodgers , the forefather of the genre , owed as much influence to blues musicians as he did to hillbilly players . To me , the question has never been , `` Is this country ? '' but rather , `` How does this or that affect country music ? '' Shifting the parameters of that age-old question allows for more thoughtful , encouraging discussions about the current state and future of the genre . -- Zackary Kephart The Ken Burns Country Music series might not have been perfect , but its acknowledgement of the music 's ties to black idioms reached far more fans and country lovers than dozens of scholarly articles or books by academics and critics . -- Ron Wynn Country Radio Just because cinematic superheroes and good ol' white-boyfriend country-pop are welcome types of fun should n't mean they suck up all the cash and cultural capital or hog all the radio spins . We need all the kinds of fun . Country fans need more voices at country radio -- from women and people of color , especially , and from those both younger and older than the norm , working a greater variety of sounds and subjects . We need a country music as varied as life itself . -- David Cantwell As always , women continue to be short-served by country radio . Kacey Musgraves ' Golden Hour won a Grammy Award not just for Best Country Album but for Album of the Year . Yet `` Rainbow , '' a single released in February , settled for a paltry No. 33 peak on Billboard 's Country Airplay chart . Similarly , Ashley McBryde won New Artist of the Year at the CMA Awards and has already been nominated for several categories in the upcoming 2020 Grammy Awards . But her singles at radio continue to fail . With other data metrics available in 2019 , continuing to give credence to a dying medium like radio is foolish . -- Zackary Kephart Yes , streaming is a bottomless pit of artists to play , and all things are theoretically possible in the medium . Yet if you look at the streaming numbers , they 're almost a mirror of terrestrial radio . The conventional online thinking chases what 's working on radio , which creates an even deeper trench . -- Holly Gleason Here in New Braunfels , Texas , we are lucky enough to have an actual independent radio station that has survived for a couple of decades focusing on regional country music and Americana . In a couple hours of listening you can hear Dale Watson , JD McPherson , Ryan Bingham , Old 97 's and Jamie Lin Wilson , for example . These artists do n't sound appreciably similar to each other , but it works . The station 's not hurting for listeners or advertisers . -- Mike Ethan Messick A study published in 2019 by the University of Ottawa 's Jada E. Watson found that women made up only 11.3 percent of country radio 's year-end playlist reports for 2018 -- a 66 percent drop from the figure reported in 2000 . The task force also found country programmers and jockeys are still being told not to play women back to back , and to play only so many per hour . There 's only one word for that : discrimination . And it HAS to stop . -- Lynne Margolis My most-hated radio hit this year was Thomas Rhett 's `` Look What God Gave Her . '' Like Rhett , I find my significant other extremely attractive , but if you ever catch me urging randos at the club to check her out , please punch me in the throat . -- David Cantwell Opening Doors This has been a year I never thought would arrive in my lifetime in terms of country music -- a year in which black input is n't deemed an oddity , happenstance or freak occurrence . Black artists have been a consistent chart presence , getting regular access to topflight songwriters and material . Kane Brown , Darius Rucker , Jimmie Allen , Rhiannon Giddens and the criminally underpublicized Valerie June , Miko Marks and Rissi Palmer are just the latest in a line of prominent black acts with deep country roots and sensibilities . No , utopia has n't arrived , and it never will , but I 'm a lot more encouraged and optimistic going into 2020 than I was going into 2010 . -- Ron Wynn My top country music moment of the year was Kacey Musgraves ' late-2019 , victory-lap appearances in support of her 2018 career album Golden Hour . At an October concert in Irving , Texas , I was struck by how her fan base is not only multigenerational , but also includes a large segment of openly gay men . In November , she appeared at the CMAs as fellow Texan Willie Nelson 's spiritual goddaughter , singing `` The Rainbow Connection . '' Both Nelson and Musgraves , within their generations , redefined the genre by advocating acceptance instead of judgment and following their artistic instincts instead of trends . May the circle be unbroken . -- Steve Crawford Yola 's Walk Through Fire is not really a country album , unless country music is truly ready to embrace a much broader definition of stylistic influences -LRB- thank you , Dan Auerbach ? -RRB- , not to mention racial inclusion . But by both traditional measures and my imaginary vision of what the music should and could be , the title track is the country vocal performance of the year , hands-down . -- Rick Mitchell There 's no question that the lack of gender equity on country radio is shameful . But if we do n't also question why there are so few trans , nonbinary , queer and POC voices on the radio , we risk making the same mistakes of the feminist movement of the '60s , by leaving these critical visions of our country on the sidelines . We need more artists like Karen & the Sorrows pushing queer representation in country music into the spotlight and doing their damnedest to lift other LGBTQ + artists up with them . -- Rachel Cholst Lil Nas X , Luke Combs and Other Dudes `` Old Town Road '' fused country with trap in much the same way that Mutt Lange fused country with hair metal on his then-wife Shania Twain 's hits . Was the outcry because Lil Nas X parachuted in from beyond Music Row 's artist-development system ? Because he used TikTok and internet algorithms instead of country radio ? Truth is , even before Billy Ray Cyrus came on board , the song was as country as the hip-hop hybrids plied by Big & Rich , Colt Ford or Florida Georgia Line . -- Holly Gleason You could probably write off Lil Nas X and `` Old Town Road '' as a novel little hiccup in the pop-culture universe that was inconsequential to actual country music -- if it was n't for the brief racial brouhaha it kicked up . Granted , a lot of this was artificially puffed up on Twitter , but it spoke to the tinderbox times we live in , the genre 's historic near-exclusivity of nonwhite artists , and just how fine a line there can be between tradition and racism . In the end , the hip-hop kid got his hit , and my elementary-age kids got something new to shout along to in my truck . So Lil Nas X , you saved me from `` Baby Shark , '' and for that I 'm eternally grateful . -- Mike Ethan Messick Lil Nas X 's indisputably country , self-ingratiating , genre-upending , weirdly traditional `` Old Town Road '' is a queer , sexy , ass-shaking masterpiece that you heard in every high school auditorium , out of every car window , and on every radio . Ubiquity does n't mean quality , but this hustler had it all . I want this to be the future of country music and am overjoyed it is the present . -- Steacy Easton Luke Combs is country music 's most improbable superstar . There 's something more relatable when the artist that 's singing to you looks like us average Joes . As boisterous , radio-friendly , arena-anthem drinking songs go , Combs ' `` Beer Never Broke My Heart '' is damn-near perfect . His song topics never vary from tried and true themes of love , having a good time and good old-fashioned sentimentality -- and that 's perfectly OK . He 's one of us . -- Ken Morton Jr. . I first encountered Tyler Childers in the summer of 2018 , when I picked up a hitchhiker . He was a medical student at Duke University whose ambition in life was to cure cancer . He asked me if I knew much about country music . I told him I 'd written a couple of books about it , but that curing cancer is a more noble pursuit . When he played me a couple of Tyler Childers tracks on his phone , I was not overly impressed , but the poor sound quality might have been a factor . Having listened to Country Squire in regular rotation for the past several months , I now know what that young surfer dude was trying to share with me . This is a country artist who can appeal both to the hipper side of the commercial country audience and the jaded , been-there-done-that geezers like me . Thanks , Doc . Work on that cure . -- Rick Mitchell Tyler Childers ' `` Matthew '' is a fiddle-driven ode to Childers ' brother-in-law , an Iraq War veteran who now works the night shift , guarding `` rusty missiles '' at the Blue Grass Army Depot near Richmond , Ky. . The song is also about Matthew 's dad , whose guitar picking Childers compares to Clarence White . Despite the allusions to missiles and war -LRB- and a terrible logging accident that cost Matthew 's father a leg years before -RRB- , nobody gets killed or hurt during the course of the song . We hear of the family fishing , swapping tales , and telling lies . It 's just a sweet portrait of people Childers obviously loves and a reminder of why I love good country music . -- Steve Terrell Jon Pardi 's `` Old Hat '' wonders what 's wrong about keeping those old-school music traditions alive and asks : `` When did old-fashioned become so out of fashion ? '' With a big country sound featuring plenty of fiddle , it feels like Pardi is making a statement . He 's in his own lane , but one that 's been paved by all the neotraditionalists who have come before . He 's developing a sound that pays homage to his heroes and influences , but also works in the modern charts . -- Ken Morton Jr. . Randy Houser , like many of his talented peers -LRB- see Chris Young , Dustin Lynch , Jerrod Niemann and Billy Currington -RRB- was a victim of the bro-country onslaught of the mid-2010s .

This blues-influenced set of excellent songs puts Houser 's once-in-a-generation voice to good use , and is a reassuring example of a return to substance by the country music mainstream . -- Markus Meyer Miranda Lambert and Other Pistols Miranda Lambert 's Wildcard has taken some heat , and to some extent that 's fair . It 's not as raw as The Weight of These Wings , as fiery as Kerosene or as accessible as Revolution . What it does represent , however , is Lambert in absolute peak form as a performer .

Maren Morris also embraced Townes , plus Kassi Ashton , RaeLynn , Hailey Whitters and Cassadee Pope . -- Holly Gleason Little Big Town and Miranda Lambert have navigated the current dismal radio atmosphere for women in country music by releasing songs they know will never be platinum hits but are so good and so important that they 'll find an audience anyway . `` Bluebird '' is Lambert 's current manifesto to dealing with life 's unexpected turns . With that wry smile she has on her album cover , she sings : `` I turn pages all the time / Do n't like where I 'm at / 34 was bad , so I just turn to 35 . '' Many of the lines from `` The Daughters '' could apply directly to what new female country artists are dealing with from within their industry , including sexism , sexual harassment , lack of support and gender disparity . -- Kristin Hall John Prine signed Kelsey Waldon because she reminded him of all the country singers he grew up on . Strong mountain voices that bend notes like steel , turning big emotions in small moments into enduring truths about the human condition -- that 's what Prine loved , and that 's the best part of Waldon 's White Noise / White Lines . -- Holly Gleason It feels as though there has been a shift in the lyrics written for country music released in 2019 . There is a story behind these newer songs that leads the listener to want to know what happens next .

Slighter still , one would think , are the chances that two American novels published in the same month would feature sole plane crash survivors -- but that 's what we have here . Make sure you have tissues handy when you read Ann Napolitano 's Dear Edward , a sure-footed tearjerker about the miraculous -- but troubled -- survival of a 12-year-old boy in a crash that kills all of the other 191 people on board a jet bound from Newark to Los Angeles , including his parents and older brother . In Kingdomtide , Rye Curtis ' stirring debut , the survivor is a 72-year-old woman who miraculously walks away from the wreckage of a small plane in Montana 's Bitterroot National Forest , leaving the mangled bodies of the pilot and her husband of 54 years , whose corpse is suspended in a tree down a treacherous cliff . Perhaps even more amazing , she lives another 20 years to tell the heart-pounding tale of how she made it out of the woods . Both novels are about the aftermath of trauma and how survival against the odds profoundly changes these characters ' lives and attitudes . Both protagonists prevail thanks to support from unexpected sources , and in both books , kindness helps steer heartbreaking tales in heartwarming directions . Of the two , Dear Edward is more moving , but Kingdomtide , although less even , is more riveting and surprising . Both novels are about the aftermath of trauma and how survival against the odds profoundly changes these characters ' lives and attitudes . - Napolitano , whose most recent novel , A Good Hard Look -LRB- 2011 -RRB- , fictionalized Flannery O'Connor 's last years , has assembled a well-oiled literary machine capable of conveying a panoply of humanity . With each chapter headed by a time stamp , the narrative of Dear Edward interweaves two tracks : a detailed account of the hours leading up to the June 12th , 2013 crash of Flight 2977 , and its aftermath , charting Edward 's long path to healing against a backdrop of unwanted celebrity . The flight portion of our entertainment includes painstaking descriptions of security procedures , boarding , pre-flight instructions , drinks , meals , and much more of the tedious minutiae of air travel . These routine details are clearly intended to ratchet up the sense of impending doom -LRB- although we 've already learned of the crash early in the book -RRB- and to underscore how calamity can upend mundanity in a flash . But they also make Flight 2977 feel at times excruciatingly long for a coast-to-coast trip -- and not always airborne even before the crash . In order to highlight what is lost in the disastrous accident , Napolitano presents capsule portraits of some of the passengers who go down with the Airbus A321 . She has rounded up a deliberate cross-section of Americans , and her omniscient third person narrator switches perspectives between them with the alacrity of a restless passenger clicking through in-flight movie options . Among them are an ailing , cantankerous , wheelchair-bound billionaire and his nurse ; an injured , sexually conflicted black soldier who is leaving the army with a lot more baggage than his colostomy bag ; a Wall Street wunderkind fueled by cocaine who gets off with the sexy first class flight attendant in an aft bathroom ; and Edward 's mother , who 's seated up front in first class in order to work on a screenplay for the new job that 's driving her family 's move to California . Her husband , a mathematician recently denied tenure at Columbia , sits in steerage with Eddie -LRB- as he 's called before his second life -RRB- and his adolescent brother . Dear Edward is in part a tale of survivor guilt , which is fueled by the weight of oppressive , often bizarre expectations on the miracle boy , especially from the families of victims who want him to fulfill their loved ones ' dreams and plans . `` Stop expecting me to have hidden powers , okay ? I 'm not a freaking wizard , '' he explodes at one point . It takes Edward years to learn to live with the aftershocks of the tragedy and absorb the liberating fact that , far from being chosen for a special purpose , his survival was just `` dumb luck . '' Rye Curtis ' 72-year-old retired grade school teacher and librarian , a devout Methodist from small town Texas , is too busy trying to stay alive in the savage Bitterroot Mountains to feel much survivor guilt . Kingdomtide -- part intense adventure story , part morality tale -- is narrated by clear-eyed , refreshingly direct 92-year-old Cloris Waldrip from the assisted living facility in Brattleboro , Vt. , where she 's living out her last years . As she notes , `` A tale belongs to whoever tells it best , '' and this one 's hers . The novel 's title is tied to the August 31 , 1986 crash date , which fell on the first Sunday of Kingdomtide -- an obsolete liturgical season of charity that spanned 13 or 14 Sundays between Pentecost and Advent . Like Dear Edward , Kingdomtide braids two narrative strands that cut like intersecting streams through the valley of this novel , but Cloris ' survival story flows with more force than the chapters featuring the forest ranger who refuses to abandon the search for her . Merlot-sotted , bitterly divorced , foul-mouthed Debra Lewis -- along with her crew of brokenhearted misfits -- truck and trek and drink and spar their way through the rough terrain , picking up occasional signs of life in dual manhunts for Cloris and a suspected child molester who 's wanted by the FBI for the disappearance of a 10-year-old girl . These chapters present a study in profound loneliness , but they can not compete with the novel 's central adventure . One of Kingdomtide 's concerns is with the vagaries of desire , and Curtis does n't stint on sometimes wince-inducing details that are not for the fastidious : Weird sex in a hot-tub from which a dead skunk has just been tossed ; a cross-dresser who dons a bear costume to chase partying teens off his property ; a hermit whose wrists are braceleted with the waistbands of girls ' underwear ; and a crazed local trailer-dweller , `` Goddamn Silk Foot Maggie , '' who fashions sculptures out of garbage , cat skeletons , and `` used tampons for earrings , '' all bound with electrical tape and melted candles . The post-accident , newly open-minded Cloris comments , `` I have come to believe that who or what we desire can not be helped ... And I do not blame people for knowing what they want . I only blame them for doing anything and everything to get it without a thought to the consequences . '' Curtis keeps us turning pages as Cloris confronts bobcats , hypothermia , starvation , icy inundation , and a strange mountain lion who walks backwards . `` It is peculiar how the human spirit endures , '' she comments . `` A person can get used to a situation , even if that situation may have once seemed intolerable . '' Her remark applies to Napolitano 's bereft boy as well . Predicated on cataclysmic , life-changing accidents , Dear Edward and Kingdomtide offer two transportative reads -- and two different takes on the human ability to adapt in order to survive .", "url": "https://www.weaa.org/post/kingdomtide-and-dear-edward-two-new-novels-take-singular-situation", "kws": ["Dear^^Edward", "part^^morality^^tale", "tales", "profound^^loneliness", "books", "husband", "survivor^^guilt", "sole^^survivor", "foul-mouthed^^Debra^^Lewis", "humanity", "kindness", "Weird^^sex", "brokenhearted^^misfits", "capsule^^portraits", "heartwarming^^directions", "Ann^^Napolitano", "hidden^^powers", "Rye^^Curtis", "survivors", "pages"], "text_category": {}}

Right now , the researchers and doctors are looking for couples to test it out . Since 1960 , the pressure of not getting pregnant has fallen on the shoulders of women . Now it 's being put on men literally . The gel is rubbed on a man 's shoulder daily . The gel is mix of testosterone and progesterone It 's supposed to decrease sperm count to a point where chance of pregnancy is zero . For some women -- birth control simply does n't work Others have negative reactions . Dr. Ajay Nagia Director of Male Reproductive Health at KU says men would keep their sex drive and when they 're ready to have kids . Their sperm count should return to normal . It 's a first of its kind . KU is looking for serious couples to take part . You have to be open to the ideas of kids and have dated for at least a year . That 's because in clinical trials the product is n't guaranteed to work so you may end up pregnant . Doctors say that is a concern . Women would likely be reminding their man a lot . But in the end , doctors say it would still create a shared responsibility that does n't exist today . The gel is about more than just convenience though . So many abused or homeless or mistreated children is because they were n't desired from the start . Sadly 50 % of pregnancies are unplanned . In the US that 's about 3 million . Half of those end up being unwanted . In fact , this article in the Washington Post says condom usage and the pill are `` pretty terrible when it comes to preventing pregnancy . The pill works 91 % of the time . Condoms , even worse at 82 % . Doctors hope this gel could change that . IUD 's are another form of birth control currently available .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrOIsP5", "title": "The Senate 's coming test", "content": "IF FACTS AND evidence still matter in American governance , the Senate will have no alternative but to take up the latest revelations of Donald Trump 's Ukrainian influence scheme when his impeachment trial begins next week . On the face of it , the clutch of notes and text messages released by House Democrats on January 14th appear to be as incriminating as anything levelled at Mr Trump 's presidency to date . Stripped from an iPhone belonging to Lev Parnas , a Ukrainian-born businessman and Republican donor who has been indicted for political corruption , they suggest Mr Trump was thickly involved in the plot hatched by his lawyer , Rudy Giuliani , to shake down Ukraine 's newly elected government for political favours . In a letter sent last year to President Volodymyr Zelensky , requesting a meeting , Mr Giuliani stressed that Mr Trump had `` knowledge and consent '' regarding his activities in Ukraine . He also emphasised that he represented Mr Trump 's personal interests -- `` as a private citizen , not as president of the United States '' . And in interviews on January 15th , Mr Parnas said the president was fully aware of his efforts in Ukraine . This appears to contradict Mr Trump 's two main defences against the charge that he abused his office by suspending military aid to Ukraine in order to coerce Mr Zelensky into opening a spurious corruption investigation into Joe Biden . Mr Trump claims to have had no knowledge of the steps Mr Giuliani took to that effect in Ukraine . He also claims that the pressure he exerted on Mr Zelensky was motivated by his broader worry about corruption in Ukraine , and therefore was in America 's interest , not his own . Other revelations in Mr Parnas 's trove are more lurid . They include texts from a previously unknown actor in the Trump-Giuliani scheme , a Republican congressional candidate called Robert Hyde , who appears to have been spying on America 's then-ambassador to Ukraine , Marie Yovanovitch , on Mr Parnas 's behalf . In exchanges with Mr Parnas early last year , Mr Hyde described the physical and electronic movements of Ms Yovanovitch , who had been identified by Mr Giuliani as an obstacle to his scheme : `` She 's talked to three people . Her phone is off . '' He also appeared to discuss the possibility of having her interfered with in some way . `` That address I sent you checks out ... they are willing to help if we/you would like a price ... Guess you can do anything in the Ukraine with money , '' wrote the Republican hopeful from Connecticut . `` Ca n't believe Trump has n't fired this bitch . '' Mr Trump , who would later tell Mr Zelensky that the veteran diplomat was going to `` go through some things '' , fired her the next month . Yet it is unlikely the Republican-controlled Senate will take much note of this apparently devastating evidence . Despite the administration 's efforts to stymie the impeachment probe run by House Democrats last year , there were already circumstantial indications that Mr Trump 's defence is as baseless as his allegations against Mr Biden . Even so , Mitch McConnell , with the backing of most of his 52 Republican colleagues , has said `` there 's no chance '' Mr Trump will be convicted . Though that might appear to make his conduct of the coming trial an irrelevance , the Senate leader has further made clear his unwillingness to weigh any evidence not attached to the narrow , because stymied , impeachment articles sent to him this week . If he gets his way -- and there are currently only four quibbling Republican moderates tempted to resist -- Mr Trump could be acquitted by the end of the month ; or in time for his state-of-the-union message on February 4th . This was predictable . Most Republican voters are behind Mr Trump for the same reasons that they have felt able to disregard the corruption and other abuses of the past three years . Their media outlets downplay or ignore the president 's misdeeds even as they accuse his accusers of the same or worse . Mr McConnell was therefore bound to do likewise . His refusal , thus far , to consider fresh evidence , including the handful of fresh testimonies Democrats want -LRB- starting with that of John Bolton , the former national security adviser -RRB- is merely an effort to downplay Mr Trump 's wrongdoing . Meanwhile he and other Republicans are blaming the Democrats for everything Mr Trump and they themselves stand accused of . The shakedown of Mr Zelensky was the sort of thing all presidents do ; Mr Biden , in some unstated way , has done worse ; the House inquiry was hopelessly biased ; Nancy Pelosi 's brief effort to force Mr McConnell to relent was pure politics -- so the impeachment is a charade ! These mangled half-truths and partisan nonsenses are all the defence Mr Trump needs . Mitch against the Enlightenment Even if predictable , this is unprecedented . Every previous presidential impeachment or near-impeachment -LRB- involving Andrew Johnson , Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton -RRB- was infected by partisanship . Yet , if Mr McConnell gets his way , this will be the first Senate trial conducted in head-on defiance of the principle of shared facts and evidence . The consequences would be graver even than the degrading of impeachment that would inevitably result . -LRB- Some Republicans are already muttering about impeaching Mr Trump 's next Democratic successor . -RRB- The Enlightenment tradition on which the American system depends -- `` of giving a damn about whether facts are facts '' , as Frank Bowman , a pre-eminent impeachment scholar , puts it -- would have suffered a jarring blow . This is what the handful of moderate Republicans who might yet force Mr McConnell 's hand should consider to be at stake . They , namely Lamar Alexander of Tennessee , Susan Collins of Maine , Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah , will have little bearing on Mr Trump 's future either way . There is nothing Mr Bolton could say to turn many Republicans against the president . Yet merely by standing for a weighing of the available facts , in sober respect for the truth , Mr Alexander and the rest would signify that disavowing them , however tempting , may also carry a cost . \u25a0 This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline `` The Senate 's coming test ''", "url": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/01/16/the-senates-coming-test", "kws": ["The^^Senate", "House^^Democrats", "Republican", "Bill^^Clinton", "impeachment", "Mr^^McConnell", "moderate^^Republicans", "impeachment^^articles", "Mitch^^McConnell", "impeaching^^Mr^^Trump", "Mr^^Biden", "fresh^^testimonies^^Democrats", "Republican^^donor", "Mitt^^Romney", "government", "Trump", "downplay^^Mr^^Trump", "partisanship", "everything^^Mr^^Trump", "Joe^^Biden"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Federal": 1.0000100135803223}}}

Los Angeles City Councilmen Paul Koretz and Gilbert Cedillo introduced a resolution Wednesday asking Major League Baseball to award the 2017 and 2018 World Series titles to the Dodgers . The league concluded this week that the Houston Astros used a camera to illicitly steal signs from opposing catchers during the 2017 season , which ended with the Astros defeating the Dodgers in the World Series . According to the league , the sign-stealing system was orchestrated by then-Astros bench coach Alex Cora , who served as manager of the Boston Red Sox in 2018 , which ended with the Red Sox defeating the Dodgers in the World Series . The league initially suspended Astros ' general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager A.J. Hinch for a year , but the club quickly fired the pair . The Astros were also fined $ 5 million and ordered to forfeit its first - and second-round draft picks for two years . Cora , who has yet to be punished by MLB , parted ways with the Red Sox this week following the release of the league investigation . Koretz conceded that it 's `` uncharted territory '' to request the league to strip two teams of their titles and award them to another , but he said it would be fair to give the Los Angeles players a championship after being cheated . `` MLB did take it seriously by -LRB- issuing -RRB- significant suspensions , which were followed by major league clubs firing managers , '' Koretz told City News Service . `` There have been scandals in the past over the century-plus that we 've had Major League Baseball in this country . I 'm not sure if we 've had this documented an effort to steal two World Series , and we know the results . ... I think that would be an appropriate payback . I think this really besmirches the national pastime and the most historic sport in American history , and there has to be a message that this is n't allowed . '' Koretz , a lifelong Dodger fan , said even the players who knew of the scheme to steal pitch signs but did not come forward about it should be held accountable . He said the cheating likely robbed longtime Dodgers players of a shot at the title , but he conceded there 's no way to know . According to Forbes Magazine , it 's highly unlikely that the teams will have to forfeit their World Series titles , as MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred is `` exceptionally limited in making it happen without going to war with the MLBPA , '' the union that represents the league 's players . The resolution does not call for the city to initiate any legal action , although some Dodger fans have suggested going to court over the matter . The last time the Dodgers won the World Series was in 1988 , when they defeated the Oakland Athletics .", "url": "https://www.foxla.com/news/l-a-councilmen-want-astros-red-sox-world-series-titles-awarded-to-dodgers", "kws": ["Dodgers", "longtime^^Dodgers^^players", "Houston^^Astros", "Red^^Sox", "Major^^League^^Baseball", "MLB", "Oakland^^Athletics", "LOS^^ANGELES", "The^^league", "manager^^A.J.^^Hinch", "L.A.", "Major^^League", "A.J.^^Hinch", "World^^Series", "Jeff^^Luhnow", "Boston", "draft^^picks", "catchers", "bench^^coach", "this^^week"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Baseball": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Baseball_MLB": 1.0}}}

I tried countless fad diets and weight-loss programs and shelled out thousands of dollars in the hopes that * something * would work for me . Weight Watchers , green tea pills , an Anytime Gym membership -LRB- that I never used -RRB- , a Gold 's Gym membership -LRB- same thing -RRB- , Beachbody at-home workouts , body wraps , Shakeology , 21-Day Fix portion containers , SlimFast -- you name it , I tried it . About a month after my best friend 's wedding , I took a break from dieting and working out . From then on , every day became a cheat day . View this post on Instagram is #transformationthursday a thing ?! . . Yes , I have lost weight between these photos . But I do n't even want to focus on that ... Look at the PURE JOY that 's come across my face in the past few years ... How ? By STOPPING \u270b the self hate negative talk in my head . And becoming AWARE of the amazing , smart , funny , kind hearted human that I am ... I work on myself EVERY DAMN DAY . No excuses . Both on my mind and body -LRB- and what I 'm fueling it -RRB- ... Am I perfect ? Hell no . But I 'm working to be 1 % better every damn day A post shared by B R O O K E . R O H D E -LRB- @brookerohde_ -RRB- on Oct 17 , 2019 at 6:57 pm PDT My official turning point came in September 2018 , after I asked a stranger to take my photo on a trip . I was on a solo vacation in Seattle and Portland , exploring the area to see if I wanted to move there . At the top of Mount Hood , I asked someone to take my picture . After , I remember looking at myself in the shot in complete disbelief . I weighed myself and saw a number higher than any other number I 'd ever seen before . That was it . I knew I had to make a change . View this post on Instagram I remember seeing the pic on the left and thinking `` omg , I look like an actual sack of potatoes '' . . . The trip on the left was a pivotal moment in my life -- i was on a solo trip exploring the #PNW to see if this was an area I would like to move to at some point ... I definitely ate and drank allllllllllll the things while on this trip . But seeing this picture was a slap in the face of all my progress over the past couple years unwind right before my eyes . I actually posted this picture , but cropped my entire body out of it . . I was ashamed and discouraged ... I was still working out 4-5 times a week . But my diet was a hot mess . I knew nothing about nutrition . I would try measuring my food one day , track macros the next , and was n't gaining any traction ... ENTER \u27a1 October 1st , 2018 ... I had enough . That picture did it for me . It was time for a major change to my routine ... I found a spin studio I fell in love with and started spinning 3-4x per week \u2640 . . And I started lowering my carbs . Nothing crazy , but in tracking macros I noticed my body responded differently -LRB- bloated , inflamed -RRB- when I consumed complex carbs ... Soon after , I lost about 10 pounds ! And kept it off -- I survived Thanksgiving and Christmas keeping off all 10 pounds . I was seeing that this was truly a lifestyle I could see working for me . . I started dabbling into Pure Therapeutic Ketones -LRB- which help promote fat loss when combined with a low carb diet -RRB- . And the fat literally started melting away . . I am down 35 pounds and I 'm never going back \u270c . . #ketoaf #ketogenic #lchf #ketogenicdiet #ketofam #lowcarblifestyle #sugarfree #grainfree #lowcarbfood #ketosis #better #girlswhocook #wiscogirl #beforeandafter #beforeandbetter #weightlosstransformation A post shared by B R O O K E . R O H D E -LRB- @brookerohde_ -RRB- on May 8 , 2019 at 11:59 am PDT When I got home from my trip , I started researching nutrition and macros . I bought a food scale and began tracking every single thing I was eating into MyFitnessPal . I 'd tried a strict keto diet a few years before but found it was too limiting for me to stick with long-term . I 'm human -- I like fruit and decadent meals , and I love chips and salsa . I knew I needed to follow an eating plan that had more flexibility . So , I decided to start messing with my macro ratios . I found if I could slowly start reducing my carb intake , healthy eating felt more manageable . I started by cutting obvious carbs like rice , pasta , and bread . Then , I began being more wary of my sugar intake , as well as that of other high-carb foods .

R O H D E -LRB- @brookerohde_ -RRB- on Sep 7 , 2019 at 10:57 am PDT I also developed a love for spin classes . I was still doing some at-home workouts from Beachbody , but my coworker had been begging me to go with her to spin . In my first class , in October 2018 , I burned over 900 calories , according to my Apple Watch . It felt like dancing on a bike , and I loved it . I started spinning three to four times per week . Soon after , I lost about 10 pounds and kept it off through Thanksgiving and Christmas . I was beginning to realize that this was truly a lifestyle I could see working for me .

R O H D E -LRB- @brookerohde_ -RRB- on Aug 26 , 2019 at 8:48 am PDT After stumbling across a Reddit thread on fasting , I began to practice intermittent fasting in January 2019 . It was hard for me to make time for breakfast in the morning , and I was drawn in to the fact that our bodies are in some ways meant for fasting -LRB- think back to the caveman days , when we were scouring for food and not eating for certain periods of time -RRB- .

Dinner : Protein and a side of veggies with a healthy fat -LRB- New York strip steak with a side of roasted broccoli dipped in a spicy aioli is a go-to of mine -RRB- .

R O H D E -LRB- @brookerohde_ -RRB- on Aug 29 , 2019 at 7:29 am PDT After years of dieting ups and downs , I wish that I 'd known that weight loss does n't have to be all or nothing . The more I told myself I `` was n't allowed to have something , '' the more I wanted it and the more I 'd binge when I finally had it . If you want the pizza , eat the pizza and move on .

I used to hop on the scale multiple times a day , but that number fluctuates for me * so * much . Now , I weigh myself on Thursday mornings , that 's it . I use it as a small indicator of my progress , but I also do body measurements . Seeing myself lose half an inch here , half an inch there felt super rewarding .

R O H D E -LRB- @brookerohde_ -RRB- on Aug 11 , 2019 at 9:08 am PDT Today , I work out four to five days a week , and I 'm still on a low-carb diet . I 've lost 45 pounds , and the weight has stayed off . Trying to enforce lots of restrictions simply does n't work for me . However , I do feel better when I limit carbs like sugar and grains in my diet -LRB- less bloating , clearer skin -RRB- . So , I choose to eat fewer carbs , but not * no * carbs . On the contrary , one of my best friends is a marathon runner , and she lives on carbs -LRB- and pretty much * only * carbs -RRB- -- so I 've realized that you really have to do what works for you .

I got promoted in my full time corporate job , and furthered my skill set by taking some hands-on training and getting certified . . I fell in love with working out -LRB- it sounds crazy , I 'm aware -RRB- . But I have this newfound energy and love moving my body and challenging it to do new things . . I tried a product my friend was selling on the Internet , and finally feel like myself again -- I casually dropped 41 pounds and have this nonstop energy . Plus , I found a passion in helping others find their better and I launched my own business to help them do so . . Oh , and I casually uprooted my life from Madison , Wisconsin to Phoenix , AZ last week . . The craziest thing ? I 've never felt so aligned with every part of my life . I feel like everything is unfolding perfectly the way it 's supposed to , and I 'm finding my path & purpose . I ca n't fucking wait to see what 26 has in store for me . .

1.0	{"docid": "0NrOlZn3", "title": "` Cigarettes for the Vagina ' : Experts Urge Women Not to Use ` Harmful ' Madura Sticks to Satisfy Men", "content": "Sellers of madura sticks promise the cigar-shaped products which fit inside the vagina will do everything from revitalize a woman 's genitals to near-enough restore her virginity . But experts have warned Newsweek that the potentially dangerous devices are little more than `` cigarettes for the vagina , '' and a scam rooted in harmful gender stereotypes around sex and pleasure . Once nestled inside the vagina , the objects named after an Indonesian island release an often unknown cocktail of ingredients . There is no evidence that the tools -- tied to the notion that women must satisfy men with little thought for their own safety or sexual preferences -- have any benefits at all . However , Sarifah Nurhayati , 27 , who lives in the Indonesian city of Depok , greater Jakarta , is among those who swear by them . She told the South China Morning Post she is five months pregnant , and plans to use them after she gives birth to get her vagina `` back in good shape to keep my husband happy . '' Her husband sells the sticks at his store in Depok . Nurhayati says she has used the sticks for years , and claims placing them inside her body for two to three minutes makes her vagina `` drier , tighter and stronger . '' One stick can be used up to 20 times , she said . `` When used regularly , it will make you feel like a virgin again , '' she claimed . However , there is no evidence that having sex permanently loosens the vagina , or that it is possible to tell if a woman has had sex . Information about what is in the sticks can be scant on packaging , but Sarifah believes `` everything is natural . '' Her husband Reno Waldi said he sells up to eight sticks a day . Products range from US$ 3 to US$ 30 , with higher quality products being more expensive , as the cheaper ones can break . `` You do n't want that to happen while using it , '' he said . Professor Linda McGowan of the University of Leeds and a researcher at the charity Wellbeing of Women took an anecdotal poll among her Indonesian students on the topic for Newsweek . One unnamed student said she knows of at least two women who use the sticks , including members of the Indonesia diaspora in the Netherlands . They had heard good testimonies about them , she said . Some of the women also bought herbs called `` ratus '' to steam the vagina , a dangerous practice which can cause severe burns . `` Talking about sex in Indonesia is still very much a taboo , '' McGowan said . `` Women may discuss these matters with their closest friends but not sisters within the family network . '' McGowan was among experts to urge women not to use the sticks , which are symptomatic of damaging attitudes towards women 's bodies seen in all parts of the world . In 2012 , the World Health Organization published a study on vaginal practices in Indonesia , as well as Thailand , Mozambique and South Africa . The body concluded that practices including inserting powders creams , herbs , tablets , and sticks into the area in an attempt to tighten it could make a woman more susceptible to infections including STIs like HIV . Dr. Jen Gunter , a gynecologist , obstetrician and best-selling author of The Vagina Bible , told Newsweek : `` Many women in many countries wipe out their vagina with the idea that too much discharge is bad . I hear this maybe once a month . It is n't as extreme a practice -LSB- as using madura sticks -RSB- , but it is part of the spectrum . '' Products like madura sticks contain astringents -- which shrink tissue -- desiccants -- which cause dryness -- and other substances that are `` physically harmful to the vagina , '' she said . They damage the vaginal skin and mucus layer , and disturb `` good '' bacteria that the body needs . The chemicals in madura sticks will likely make it painful to have sex , she said . Dismissing the myth that it is normal for women to experience discomfort during sex , Gunter said this only happens if there is a problem with technique , they have experienced sexual assault , or have a medical condition . Dr. Amanda Selk , a gynaecologist and Associate Professor at the University of Toronto , Canada , told Newsweek madura sticks `` are marketed to promote a myth about the ` virgin ' vagina when there is no difference in feeling for either sex between a virginal and non-virginal vagina . `` The vagina does not stay stretched out after sex and you ca n't tell from muscle tone whether someone has ever had sex , '' she said , adding : `` With childbirth there can be some weakening of the pelvic floor that can be strengthened with pelvic floor exercises . '' Madura sticks `` are being marketed to fix a problem that does n't exist , '' Selk continued . `` Sex should be pleasurable to both people or there is a problem . Different people find different aspects of sex pleasurable . Good communication between partners is the key to good sex not spending money on unnecessary products . '' Gunter chimed that women should n't buy into products which claim to tighten the vagina , stating these are `` medically harmful and playing off patriarchal tropes . '' In fact , healthy women should never use any products which promise to clean , freshen or enhance the vagina in any way , she said . The organ , which is a tube of muscles , can keep itself healthy , partly thanks to secretions called discharge . Gunter compared it to a self-cleaning oven . Simply gently washing the surrounding area , called the vulva , as well as the perineal area between the vagina the anus with unperfumed soaps every day is all that women need to do , and more than once a day during their period if needed . Depending on her situation , all a woman needs to buy to put inside her vagina is condoms if she partners with men ; tampons or a menstrual cup ; pessaries ; and sex toys made of substances which can be cleaned , said Gunter . A woman might also like to use a water or silicone-based lubricant , which will be designed to align with the vaginal osmolality and pH , as well as products designed to provide moisture for perimenopausal or menopausal women . `` While not well studied , some food oils -LRB- coconut and olive -RRB- seem to be safe -LRB- anecdotally -RRB- for use as lube . Not with latex condoms though , '' said Gunter . Despite the potential risks , a few taps and clicks on Google Shopping and Facebook bring up marketing for the sticks . Gunter called on such websites to make an effort to remove links to such products from their platforms . One Facebook post described madura sticks as a `` must have for every woman , '' and claimed they `` tighten loose cookie muscles . '' Google Shopping results for madura sticks include eBay listings claiming they make the vagina `` tight , '' `` clean , '' and turn a woman into an `` Instant Virgin . '' Newsweek has contacted Facebook , Google and eBay for comment . `` Obviously as a doctor I see much harm in these things , '' said Gunter . `` When I Google cigarettes I do n't get the same volume of advertising as I do for these kinds of vaginal products . As they are essentially cigarettes for the vagina , if there is advertising restrictions for cigarettes in my opinion they should apply here as well . '' McGowan commented . `` In growing economies , such as Indonesia , the market for products via Amazon , Google etc. is huge , '' she said . `` These sites do sell a number of ` health and lifestyle ' products which researchers would say were not evidence based . '' Selk conceded it 's impossible to ban `` things that are bad for you . '' Instead , she argued : `` I think we need more articles and media supporting women to be proud of their bodies , learn to love themselves the way they are and not fall in to the trap of buying or using things that are not helpful and potentially harmful .

I 'm typing this at Spirit House -LSB- 2 -RSB- , because it 's quiet . Three tables away sit two middle-aged monks . Checking their smartphones , they 're just chilling . Puffing a cigarette , one flashes his purple nipple episodically . In his cage , a crested bird whistles , while others , flying freely , chirp . The Mekong is within sight but barely trickling . There are too many dams upriver , most of them Chinese . With its hand on the spigot , China has much of Southeast Asia by its yellow balls . It 's always soothing to watch the red sun set , right from here . After spending a week at the Davika Hotel , in a windowless room costing $ 20 a night , a bit too much for my taste and welfare , I 'm now contentedly tucked -LSB- 3 -RSB- into the alarmingly named Mixok -LSB- 4 -RSB- . For just $ 11 daily , I might just linger here until death do us part , though this wheezing resthouse is likely to collapse before I do , in the middle of the night , under an impossibly huge moon . A final monsoon will wash us all away . My barred window looks into a narrow and pleasantly noisy alley . This is the tropics , man , where men , birds and/or insects are supposed to generate an unceasing cacophony . Within shouting distance , there 's the Lao Poet Hotel , but that costs $ 90 a night , and at the far end , there 's La Cage du Coq . It 's not a whorehouse , cockfight club or mixed martial arts gym , but merely a French restaurant , where entrees hover around nine bucks . No , thanks . Traveling alone , I 'm accompanied by a French corpse . Montb\u00e9liard-born Henri Mouhot -LRB- 1826-1861 -RRB- wrote wonderfully in English , `` It is only in the solitude and depth of the woods that one can fully admire and enter into the sort of harmony and concord which reigns in the songs of the various birds , forming such a pleasing kind of symphony that the voice of one is rarely overpowered by that of another ; one can enjoy at once the general effect and the melodious note of the particular winged musician we prefer . Scarcely does the sun begin to gild the tops of the trees , when , alert and gay , they commence their morning hymn . The martins , the warblers , the drongos , and the dominicans , respond to the turtle-doves ' cooing in the highest branches . Music of a less dulcet nature is discoursed by the aquatic and rapacious tribes , such as cranes , herons , and kingfishers , who from time to time utter their piercing cries . '' Even in a Lao city , birds still serenade all day long , so I 'm happy to have a window -LSB- 5 -RSB- again . The most blessed trees are riotous with twittering birds . Before dawn , orange clad , barefoot monks -LSB- 6 -RSB- in single files make their rounds to exchange chanted -LSB- 7 -RSB- blessings -LSB- 8 -RSB- for food . Waiting for them on sidewalks , the devout sit on straw mats or low stools . In front of them are woven baskets and aluminum or wooden bowls containing sticky rice , bananas , money and/or bottles of water . Lao and Thai monks are forbidden to eat after noon , so many down soft drinks all day long , resulting in more than a few turning into virtual Buddhas , in form if not spirit . Also out -LSB- 9 -RSB- are whores with verifiable snatches and ladyboys -LSB- 10 -RSB- , trawling for drunk farangs . Seeing me wandering , a smiling beauty puts her hands together and stands on one foot . I had wanted to come earlier , but flights from Saigon were indirect and surprisingly expensive , and there were no vans or buses from Ea Kly , where I also lived . This time , taking a bus from Da Nang to Savannakhet cost me just $ 17.30 , but I almost did n't make it to the station . The hired driver freaked when I spoke to him in Vietnamese , on the phone . Soon after hanging up , he texted , `` I 'm sorry , brother , but I do n't drive Vietnamese or Viet Kieus . You should contact the travel agent for a refund . '' At least he answered my call . `` Brother , '' I pleaded , `` I 've already booked a hotel in Laos , and I 've returned my room in Hoi An . I 'm standing in the dark , with my bags . Not all Viet Kieus are the same , and you do n't even know me . Just do me a favor , brother , and take me to Da Nang . '' After fifteen minutes of haggling with him and the travel agent , the crank finally showed up , but only on the condition that he would n't charge me anything , just to show that this was never about money . He just hated his fellow Vietnamese , at least as customers . With relief , I entered his car . As dawn paled , however , I got a closer look at this man 's face and realized , with renewed anxiety , that we had met days earlier . I had walked into his travel agency after seeing a board listing bus rides into Laos , `` Brother , I have an American passport . Do I need a visa for Laos ? '' `` Of course , you need a visa ! You need a visa to enter every country ! '' `` Actually , you do n't . Some countries do n't require a visa . '' `` They all require a visa ! '' He smirked . `` Brother , I 've been to about thirty countries , and many of them did n't require a visa . I know . '' `` I do n't care if you 've been to a hundred ! They all require a visa ! '' Shaking my head , I had walked out , yet here I was , being driven by the same combative man . I was at his mercy . How does a guy like that stay in business ? Who can live with him ? In silence , we rolled up Highway One , on a stretch that had been littered with the mangled dead , screaming wounded and busted vehicles in March of 1975 . Finally , the bus station -LSB- 11 -RSB- came into view in gorgeous sunshine . I got on -LSB- 12 -RSB- my coach -LSB- 13 -RSB- . The twelve-hour ride was uneventful . There were three rows of two-tiered sleeping -LSB- 14 -RSB- berths -LSB- 15 -RSB- , with each made for a stunted , bunched up munchkin . The two aisles were also packed -LSB- 16 -RSB- , with one man forced to sit nearly the entire time . This scrawny and frowning dude could have gained a bit more space just by piping up a bit , for the woman right in front of him had too much room . A Gimpel the Fool type , though , he kept his peace . We passed through Quang Tri , then Khe Sanh . All along the way , there were many cemeteries embellishing the landscape , for most of them were quite gorgeous , with their graves inspiringly ornate , each a miniature Oriental temple . These cities of the dead looked better than the living ones , nearby . There were also many military cemeteries , where the unidentifiable also rested . We 're just pondering hash . Cramped , I did n't rest much , but damn it , I was entering Laos , if they would let me in ! The border paperwork went smoothly . Crossing into Poland from Ukraine three years ago , our bus was detained for nearly five hours . With their ultra cool yet swaggering passports , Americans may not appreciate how serious , and often even deadly , are borders . The bus was jammed with Laos and Thais -LSB- 17 -RSB- . There were just a handful of Vietnamese , and only one white , a Swiss queer traveling with his Thai boy toy . At the last Vietnamese settlement , a handful of Bru -LSB- 18 -RSB- beggars -LSB- 19 -RSB- waited outside -LSB- 20 -RSB- the roadside restaurant where we ate . The old women looked like driftwood -LSB- 21 -RSB- in conical hats , windbreakers and sarongs , and the two boys , stunted and not too bright . It 's hard to think if your stomach is always resentful . Though the GDP per capita of Vietnam and Laos are roughly the same , the Land of a Million Elephants does look poorer -LSB- 22 -RSB- . There are far fewer stores lining roads , and rural houses are mostly made of unpainted wood . Homes of two or more stories are seldom seen . Most strikingly , many fields are left fallow . The demographic pressure to cultivate each inch of land is just not as intense , as in Vietnam . Even in Vientiane , there are unpaved roads , with one stretch -LSB- 23 -RSB- right by the Mekong , on a prime piece of real estate just 1.4 mile from the Presidential Palace . The country 's tallest building has but 14 stories . Not that I think Asia 's skyscraping contest is so wonderful . Six of the seven tallest on earth are in Asia . In Savannakhet , I was supposed to switch buses to go to Vientiane immediately , but rolling in , what I saw from the bus windows jazzed my interest , so I just had to get off for this one-night -LSB- 24 -RSB- stand . Even with no hotel reservation , Lao money or working phone , I had to inspect more closely Savannakhet 's mysterious concrete dinosaurs at a roundabout , the Nuan Money -LSB- 25 -RSB- Restaurent Guesthouse -LRB- with its two red lanterns dangling over a cheerless entrance -RRB- and the Macchiato de Coffee , with its trilingual confusion , London Tube sign and a red British phone booth -LSB- 26 -RSB- , sans phone , fronting it . The bus station was a large pavilion , with benches mostly filled with rural folks , with some women in the traditional tube dress , the `` sinh . '' More were decked out in jeans , T-shirts , track pants or pantsuits , the last undoubtedly in honor of Hillary Clinton , even if they had never heard of the eternally cackling candidate . Run , witch , run ! One side was a darkened row of sad looking doors , which I correctly identified as the station 's resthouse . That should be cheap , I reassured myself , so I 'll stay there , if I ca n't find anything reasonable . There are only 50,000 Vietnamese in Laos , supposedly , yet during my brief stop in Savannakhet , I saw quite a few Vietnamese businesses -LSB- 27 -RSB- , and it was at a Viet restaurant -LSB- 28 -RSB- that I managed to exchange some money , actually . All the Savannakhet ATMs I had tried rejected my cursed card . It was no fun to trudge around in the dark , overburdened , without any cash . In any foreign place , a compatriot , or at least someone who speaks your language , can save your sorry ass . Traveling through Siam , Laos , Cambodia and Cochinchina , Mouhot routinely relied on white missionaries , though it must be added , local dignitaries often treated this farang with tremendous hospitality . Still , a man who had willingly left all that 's familiar to lunge into the unknown could n't help but be moved by each reminder of his heritage . One example , `` The sight of the Cross in foreign lands speaks to the heart like meeting with an old friend ; one feels comforted and no longer alone . '' In Vientiane , I would run into many more Vietnamese businesses , two large Buddhist -LSB- 29 -RSB- temples -LSB- 30 -RSB- and , most remarkably , one devoted -LSB- 31 -RSB- to Tran Hung Dao -LSB- 32 -RSB- , a 13th century military hero worshipped for repelling two Mongol invasions . The profound depth of history is a comfort progress devotees ca n't fathom . The 268-mile bus ride from Savannakhet -LSB- 33 -RSB- to Vientiane took nine hours , but that 's because we had several stops -LSB- 34 -RSB- , all longer than necessary , for Laos are relaxed . The bus was so packed , people did n't just jam -LSB- 35 -RSB- the aisle -LSB- 36 -RSB- , perched on plastic stools , but were sardined into a semi-dark luggage compartment -LSB- 37 -RSB- , among bags and a motorbike . Removed of its fixtures , the bathroom was also used for bags . Everyone was cheerful , however . Sometimes , Lao pop with its prancing rhythm would play over the speakers . At each stop , food and drink vendors -LSB- 38 -RSB- rushed on to sell -LSB- 39 -RSB- , most notably , various meats and even eggs -LSB- 40 -RSB- skewered on sticks . Having traveled 350 miles across Laos , I have n't seen one tusked animal , just a million statues -LSB- 41 -RSB- of elephants . They guard gates , flank elevators and dangle their trunks from walls . I even ran across one with a buxom mermaid -LSB- 42 -RSB- on top . I must say that the Lao landscape is much cleaner than Cambodia 's , however , and perhaps even Vietnam 's , not that 's saying much . There is enough trash , but they tend to be clear plastic bags . Degraded and murky with time , they lie still or gaily skip across the countryside . Maybe Laos do n't even see them , or consider this garbage a kind of modern foliage . If I was the President of Laos , I would decree that clear plastic bags be outlawed , and replaced with bright orange ones , so that they 'd resemble leaves on the ground . Tourism will spike with this new slogan , `` Laos , where it 's always autumn ! '' Or better yet , `` Laos , the eternal Vermont . '' Compared to Vietnam , Laos has many more cars and trucks to motorbikes , but this can be attributed to the much lower Laos taxes on vehicles . A Vietnamese who does a lot of business in Laos , with about ten trips here yearly , has this explanation , `` The car is a much bigger status symbol here . Unlike us , they would buy a car instead of improving their house . A rich guy in Vietnam might have two cars , but you 'll find many Laos with three or four cars , and they do n't put them to work , like we do . If we have several cars , they must make money for us , but here , they just use cars to drive around , for leisure . '' He told me that on the Savannakhet/Vientiane bus . It appeared there were only Laos on it , yet here we were , two Vietnamese who quite by chance sat next to each other . A foundry owner , he 's also from Nam Dinh , my ancestral province , so we even talked with the same accent , more or less . In the mid 19th century , Laos was terra incognita to the West . Mouhot in 1860 , `` During the last twenty-five years , only one man , as far as I know , a French priest , has penetrated to the heart of Laos , and he only returned to die in the arms of the good and venerable prelate , Mgr . Pallegoix . I know the discomfort , fatigue , and tribulations of all sorts to which I am again about to expose myself ; the want of roads , the difficulty of finding means of conveyance , and the risk of paying for the slightest imprudence by a dangerous or even fatal illness . '' The first Westerner to reach Luang Prabang , Mouhot himself would be killed by this land he so adored and venerated . Buried in a nearly inaccessible patch by the Nam Kan , his grave is continually assaulted by the jungle , just like the Angkor Wat he so famously described . It 's eternally resonant , `` One of these temples -- a rival to that of Solomon , and erected by some ancient Michael Angelo -- might take an honourable place beside our most beautiful buildings . It is grander than anything left to us by Greece or Rome , and presents a sad contrast to the state of barbarism in which the nation is now plunged . '' So even the mightiest of civilizations can rapidly be reduced to destitution , squalor and ignorance . One day , you cockily and effortlessly build pyramids , the Taj Mahal or innumerable atomic bombs . The next morning , you 're panhandling outside the Japanese-owned 7-11 or shitting on the sidewalk . In 1975 , Laos had just three million people , and it 's up to 6.9 million now , an astoundingly low figure compared to adjacent Vietnam 's 97 million , Thailand 's 70 million , Myanmar 's 54 million , Cambodia 's 16.6 million and , of course , China 's continent-bursting , globe-popping 1.4 billion . You can see where this is going . Laos ' underexploited space and resources are being eyed by its neighbors , plus a few others . Leading the pack is China , by far . It has huge construction -LSB- 43 -RSB- projects -LSB- 44 -RSB- all over Laos , with thousands of its own workers brought in . China 's also building a rail line , Lao 's first , from Vientiane to the Chinese border . When it 's finished next year , everything Chinese will be funneled into Laos at an even more accelerated pace . With its unprecedented demographic pressure , China -LSB- 45 -RSB- has a plan to infiltrate everywhere . Vietnam , too , has designs on Laos , I 'm sure . Always have . Mouhot wrote about Luang Prabang in 1861 , `` Were they not restrained by fear of the Siamese , and their horror of the jungles so prolific of death , this principality would soon fall into the hands of the Annamites , who now dare not advance nearer than seven days ' journey off . '' As for the Thais , a third of their land really belongs to Laos , but that logic counts for nothing . Everyone takes what he can . Invading Laos in 1828 , the Thais destroyed Pha That Luang , Laos ' most sacred stupa , and in their brief war against the French in 1940-41 , they wrecked it again . Over drinks at Spirit House , Laos expert Mike Boddington told me that Vietnam is spending $ 100 million to build Laos ' new National Assembly -LSB- 46 -RSB- . When someone spends that much on you , he wants to nudge up a bit , at least . Vietnam 's President Nguyen Phu Trong 's first trip abroad was also to Laos . Geopolitical jockeying is a universal game . Mike has a world of experiences of seemingly everywhere , but his special focus is Southeast Asia , with Laos his most ardent passion . Mike first came in 1994 , `` We flew into Vientiane on one of the old Chinese copies of a Russian twin-engine plane that accommodated about 50 people in cramped circumstances : there was a Boeing 737-200 on this route , leased from Iceland , but that day it was not operational because the pilot had been knocked off his motorcycle in Vientiane and killed . '' Mike was the key figure in the creation of Cope -LSB- 47 -RSB- , a center to help victims of landmines , plus others disabled . I 'll visit his home soon on the outskirts of Vientiane . North Vietnam 's Ho Chi Minh Trails branched into Laos , so the United States dropped a record two million tons of ordnance on this poor country . These included 270 million cluster bombs , of which up to 80 million have n't detonated yet . Each year , Laos continue to be killed by UXOs , so that 's the most tangible of the American legacy here . More abstract and unquantifiable , yet much more explosive , is the dissemination of an increasingly absurd and decadent American -LSB- 48 -RSB- culture -LSB- 49 -RSB- . Projecting power -LSB- 50 -RSB- and sex , America enthralls , so on Vientiane 's tuk-tuks , for example , I 've encountered several American badasses on windshields , dashboards and mud flaps . These include Al Pacino as Serpico -LSB- 51 -RSB- , Sylvester Stallone as Cobra -LSB- 52 -RSB- , and , twice already , even Stallone -LSB- 53 -RSB- as Rambo -LSB- 54 -RSB- ! There 's even a Rambo haircutter , although its sign shows two blacks -LSB- 55 -RSB- with huge afros ! On one of the Rambo-adorned tuk-tuks , there was also an American Eagle -LSB- 56 -RSB- and , oddly enough , Che Guevara -LSB- 57 -RSB- ! So the same driver idolizes a Commie killer and a killer Commie , but they 're both seductive images of power . Quantity and quality wise , no one sells this better than America . Traveling through Southeast Asia , Mouhot was repeatedly baffled by the apparent happiness of its people , despite their poverty , high taxes and/or oppression from their rulers . Laos were additionally cursed , `` Their poverty borders on misery , but it mainly results from excessive indolence , for they will only cultivate just sufficient rice for their support ; this done , they pass the rest of their time in sleep , lounging about the woods , or making excursions from one village to another , paying visits to their friends on the way . '' Before you dismiss the above as biased nonsense from a white racist , the Vietnamese foundry owner made very similar observations , `` There are n't so many foreign companies here because the Laos just are n't that reliable . They do n't have the same attitude towards work as we do . After the 15th and 30th of each month , many wo n't show up the next day because they just got too drunk after being paid . '' He laughed . `` They do n't eat so well , but they like to drink . '' `` What do they drink ? Rice wine ? '' `` No , beer . They love their beer ! '' Ca n't blame them . Beerlao is excellent and cheap , and what 's wrong with just ambling to neighboring villages to chatter with your buddies , or plopping yourself under a tree , to reflect , doze off or hear birds singing ? Buddhists value silence and stillness , and despite all of its modern convulsions , Laos is still a land of temples . With its spacious ground , each is a meditative oasis . A tuk-tuk driver may not recognize an address , but if you just tell him which temple it 's near , he 'll take you there . Calmed by Laos ' pace , I 'm lingering . _______ About author Linh Dinh 's latest book is Postcards from the End of America , an account of our political , economic and social unraveling .

It has n't been much of an issue for the last few years , but my sex life has improved a lot in that time . I realized that I am quite submissive and masochistic , and I have found a wonderful dominant partner who I 've gotten to explore that kink with in a positive and healthy way . Last night , I watched the movie Secretary , and Maggie Gyllenhaal 's character is someone who self-harms but stops when she begins a Dom/sub relationship with her boss . Obviously this film is flawed and not exactly a great guideline for healthy BDSM relationships . However , I did find myself relating to her character and am now questioning my motives for pursuing this kind of sexual relationship . I worry that I may be unintentionally using the pain that I lovingly experience from my partner as a replacement for the pain I used to experience from my bad habits . Or am I using BDSM as a form of harm reduction ? Is it rational to even compare these two things ? -- Seeking Careful Advice Regarding Recent Emotional Discovery A `` I completely get where SCARRED is coming from , '' says Lina Dune , the creator of Ask a Sub -LRB- askasub.com -RRB- . `` You 're discovering your kinks , and then the culture comes in with a not-entirely-accurate film or hot take , and it can taint your self-discovery . '' Dune is known as a `` fairy submother '' to her thousands of followers on Instagram , where she regularly posts about the Dom/sub lifestyle and frequently highlights red flags that newbies to the kink scene may miss . -LRB- A Dom who insists he `` does n't negotiate '' with subs ? Run away . -RRB- While still relatively young herself , Dune has been active in the kink scene for many years and identifies as a 24/7 lifestyle sub . `` There 's a difference between self-harm and what SCARRED is doing with her Dom in a consensual , rational , measured environment with safe words in place , '' says Dune . `` And it 's telling that she did n't write in to say , ` Oh my god , I 'm using Dom/sub to self-harm ! ' Rather , she 's worried she might be unintentionally or unknowingly engaging in some form of self-harm . '' SCARRED , you do n't want to over-interpret the film 's fictional narrative . Meaning , while it suggested there was a causal relationship between Gyllenhaal 's character entering into a Dom/sub relationship and no longer engaging in acts of self-harm , that does n't mean the same is true for you . `` The culture infantilizes us all when it comes to owning our sexual desires -- and that 's especially the case for women , '' says Dune . `` The message is : You do n't know what you 're getting into , or You do n't realize the effect this is having . But if there 's one thing SCARRED is an expert on , it 's herself . It 's not like she 's in a trance when she 's with her Dom -- no matter what the movies want us to believe about Dom/sub relationships -- which means she 's consciously choosing this for herself , and it feels healthy and good . Our bodies do n't usually lie . And I 'd be willing to bet that self-harm did not feel that way . '' But even if it turns out you 're right , it could still be a good thing . Dune suggests you explore your feelings with a kink-positive therapist . `` From my perspective , it looks like SCARRED may have been manufacturing her own version of exposure therapy , which some somatic-based psychologists have suggested is exactly what negotiated , consent-based kink play can provide , '' says Dune . `` Looking fear in the eye and then being able to back away from it at will -- and end with a cuddle and a check-in with your play partner -- can make you feel more powerful , not less . So if SCARRED can consciously work through this with a therapist and her Dom , this BDSM relationship has the potential to be very healing , just as long as she maintains her autonomy within it . '' Q I 'm a 26-year-old straight man , and I have n't gotten laid in a while . I never actually got much to begin with . I lost my virginity late -LRB- age 23 , also my first kiss -RRB- and had bottled up quite a bit of frustration until then -LRB- still got a lot of that left over -RRB- . I also suffer from crippling social anxiety -- so crippling , in fact , that I ca n't even get to know people online , which rules out online dating . I have recently come to the realization that the only way for me to ever get better is to stop wanting to get laid so much . Which . Is . Hard . The first step is learning to be OK with things as they are , which I am making progress with . But sex is everywhere : TV , movies , magazines . On the few occasions I do get to spend time with people , sex comes up a lot . People seriously complain to me about not having `` gotten any '' for two months , and that 's not enough for them . I 've heard people describe themselves as `` late bloomers '' because they had their first time at 17 or 19 . I feel like such a freak . I have a male roommate who frequently has women over . I hear them going at it through the wall and get panic attacks because of it . I need some advice on how to be OK with not getting any , not really having gotten much to begin with , and just generally being nervous and inexperienced and self-conscious and lonely . I know that 's a lot , but perhaps you have some valuable thoughts for me . -- After School Special A Since there 's no way to strip the sex scenes and sexual references from every TV show you watch , magazine you read or conversation you have , ASS , working on yourself is going to be a far better use of your time than demanding a remade/de-sexed world . And by `` working on yourself , '' of course I mean `` getting your ass into therapy . '' Whether or not you ever get laid again , getting professional help to address your frustrations and social anxiety is going to improve your life . -LRB- It will up the chances that you 'll get laid again , ASS , but no promises . -RRB- And take heart : For every letter like yours I get from a straight guy , ASS , I get an identical letter from a straight woman . Which means there are a lot of women out there who are just as inexperienced , self-conscious and lonely . Once you 're in good working order -- not perfect , just functional -- you might be able to connect with one of those women or some other woman . -LRB- But no one wants to connect with a guy who gives off a rage-y vibe , so please stay away from incel forums . -RRB- And your inexperience makes you less freakish these days than you seem to realize . While 54 percent of high-school students had had sex by age 18 in 1991 , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , today only 41 percent of high-school students have had sex by age 18 . Which means there are a lot of `` late bloomers '' out there , ASS . And while you 've doubtless heard that confidence is attractive , you most likely have n't been told that a person does n't have to be experienced to be confident . A guy just has to be comfortable enough in his own skin to be open about who he is , where he 's at and what he 's looking for . But first things first : Get yourself a good therapist ... and maybe a pair of noise-cancelling headphones . -- -- -- Have a question about sex , sexuality or relationships ?

0.0	{"docid": "0NrPjiqh", "title": "Rolls-Royce Black Badge Cullinan - Singapore Launch", "content": "Singapore - At the Geneva Motor Show in March 2016 , Rolls-Royce Motor Cars presented Black Badge ; a permanent Bespoke family of motor cars that defined the taste patterns of an emerging generation of super-luxury consumer . These unapologetic and highly dynamic products responded to those who refused to be defined by traditional codes of luxury and did much to attract new customers to the marque , reassured by Rolls-Royce 's fluency in their bold aesthetic and uncompromising lifestyle requirements . This highly successful alter ego is codified by the mathematical symbol that represents a potential infinity , which is placed discreetly within the motor car 's interior . This marking , known also as the lemniscate , was applied to Sir Malcolm Campbell 's record-breaking Rolls-Royce-powered Blue Bird K3 hydroplane , denoting that it belonged to an insurance class reserved for boats with unlimited and therefore infinite engine power . Rolls-Royce Motor Cars selected this hallmark for Black Badge to reflect its own unrelenting pursuit of power . Rolls-Royce debuted Black Badge with Wraith and Ghost in 2016 followed by Dawn in 2017 . Today , the family is completed for the first time in South East Asia with the introduction of Black Badge Cullinan in Singapore : the darkest and most urban statement of Black Badge yet . Renee Chua , Managing Director for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Singapore said : `` The super-luxury landscape is changing . Increasingly , we are seeing interest in Black Badge not only from our existing clientele , but now from a group of younger , adventurous Rolls-Royce customers who are not bound by convention . '' Cullinan Goes Black Created to satisfy overwhelming demand from younger , more adventurous clients , Cullinan in its silver badge guise , was launched to global acclaim in 2018 , immediately becoming the world 's pinnacle super-luxury SUV . Combining luxury in its purest form with genuine practicality and off-road capability , Cullinan unequivocally delivered on the promise of an experience that is Effortless , Everywhere . The Rolls-Royce of SUVs did much to reach a new group of clients looking for unfettered access to the world 's wildest places and most enriching experiences . Yet , within this group exists a subset of individuals who seek to subvert the motor car 's domineering presence by permanently cloaking it in the night . Cullinan has conquered the world 's wildest reaches . Now it is time for Black Badge Cullinan to conquer new urban frontiers . Black Badge Cullinan Exterior : The King of the Night While clients can draw on the marque 's 44,000 ` ready to wear ' paint options or commission an entirely individual Bespoke hue , it is anticipated that many will opt for Black Badge 's signature Black . Multiple layers of paint and lacquer are meticulously applied and hand-polished 10 times at the Home of Rolls-Royce in Goodwood , West Sussex , representing the most comprehensive surface finish process ever applied to a solid paint colour . The depth and intensity of Black Badge Cullinan 's coachwork serves as the perfect canvas upon which to throw a contrasting hand-painted Coachline into stark relief . On the prow of the motor car lies the defining expression of Black Badge . The Spirit of Ecstasy mascot , which has taken many forms throughout the marque 's history , is presented in high gloss black chrome . For the first time this finish extends onto its mounting plate , creating the darkest Black Badge yet . This transformation pervades the other symbols of Black Badge . The ` Double R ' badge on the front , flanks and aft invert to become silver-on-black , while chrome surfaces such as the front grille surround , side frame finishers , boot handle , boot trim , lower air inlet finisher and exhaust pipes are darkened . While they appear black , the vertical grille bars remain polished , reflecting the blackened surfaces that surround them to add a frisson of movement that hints at the motor car 's dynamic intent . The overall effect artfully simplifies and enlarges the motor car 's exterior design graphics , emphasising its imposing proportions and confident stance . This is further dramatised by all-new 22-inch forged alloy wheels , reserved exclusively for Black Badge Cullinan . Designed in the Black Badge house style , the gear-like graphic emphasises the model 's vast reserves of power while also recalling an infinitely occurring lemniscate . The gloss black and polished design also creates the perfect stage for the marque 's first ever coloured brake caliper . The high gloss Red paint has been specifically developed to withstand the rigours of elevated temperatures generated by the motor car 's uprated braking system while still offering a perfectly smooth finish befitting of Rolls-Royce . Black Badge Cullinan Interior : Superlative comfort . Audacious design Ordinarily , great efforts are expelled to distance occupants from a Rolls-Royce 's mechanical function . However , the marque 's Colour and Trim experts gently sensationalised the engineering substance of Black Badge , seamlessly blending superlative comfort , bold aesthetics , advanced materials and precise , meticulous craftsmanship . This ethos is perfectly embodied by Black Badge Cullinan 's Technical Carbon veneer . In the spirit of Sir Henry Royce 's founding philosophy , `` When it does not exist , design it '' , a collaboration between the marque 's designers , engineers and craftspeople saw the creation of a new luxury material . Inspired by masterpieces of urban architecture , a naked-weave carbon-fibre finish has been developed to create highly accurate repeating geometrical shapes that produce a powerful three-dimensional effect . Each leaf of Technical Carbon is finished with six coats of lacquer before being left to cure for 72 hours then hand-polished to Rolls-Royce 's hallmark mirror finish . This process takes 21 days and is only deemed complete once every piece is inspected by a craftsperson to ensure complete reflective uniformity across each of the 23 pieces within the car . Starlight Headliner has joined historical Rolls-Royce iconography such as the Spirit of Ecstasy , Pantheon Grille and ` Double R ' monogram . Its presence in Black Badge Cullinan intensifies the cabin 's ambience by casting a low light over the lavish leather seats . Presented in fine Black leather , handwoven with 1344 fibre optic lights , it is a true reflection of the sky at night and incorporates eight brilliant white shooting stars that dart at random predominantly over the front occupants , subtly acknowledging the motor car 's owner-driver appeal . Reflecting the marque 's Bespoke philosophy , Black Badge Cullinan benefits from a near-infinitely configurable interior colour palette . Black Badge clients often use interior space as a stage to create dramatic high contrast colourways , so for Cullinan Rolls-Royce 's Colour and Trim designers created a bold new leather colour , Forge Yellow , to offer as part of the brand 's curated collection . As with all leather colours , this can be commissioned for the motor car 's Viewing Suite or incorporated into the design of a highly Bespoke Recreation Module tailored to the client 's exacting specification . A final touch completes the interior seating : the Infinity lemniscate motif is embroidered into the fold - down rear arm-rest as an elegant reminder of the power contained within . This simple but potent symbol is also incorporated in the illuminated treadplates and engraved on the brushed and darkened steel clock case . Red-tipped clock hands and instrument display needles also serve as a discreet reminder of the motor car 's dynamic prowess . Black Badge Cullinan Engineering . The Architecture of Luxury 's dark side Black Badge is far more than an aesthetic treatment . In creating this class of motor car , it was of vital importance for Rolls-Royce to conceive a meticulously considered dynamic personality that perfectly harmonised with the motor car 's remarkable visual identity . Indeed , the exceptionally high expectations of the marque 's clients defined a rigorous testing protocol lasting more than three years to ensure that Black Badge Cullinan was relevant to their needs . Key to the visceral thrill of Black Badge Cullinan is the Architecture of Luxury , Rolls-Royce 's proprietary all-aluminium architecture that debuted with Phantom . The sub-structure not only delivers extraordinary body stiffness but its flexibility and scalability allowed Cullinan to be fitted with all-wheel drive and four-wheel steering in its silver badged guise . These dynamic features have been comprehensively exploited and re-engineered for Black Badge while retaining the peerless quality of ride that has driven Rolls-Royce 's success . The Architecture of Luxury has been engineered to meet size and weight requirements of different propulsion systems . When the driver presses the ` Low ' button situated on the gear selection stalk , they unlock Black Badge Cullinan 's full suite of technologies . This is asserted by the proud amplification of the motor car 's 6.75-litre twin-turbocharged V12 through an entirely new exhaust system , announcing its arrival with a deep , authoritative basso profundo . It was deemed unnecessary to make changes to the engine 's ample internal capacity , however the flexibility of the twin-turbo V12 has been exploited to generate an extra 29PS creating a total output of 600PS . The sense of a single , infinite gear has also been sensationalised with the addition of a further 50NM of torque , bringing the total to a 900NM . Black Badge Cullinan benefits from a Bespoke transmission and throttle treatment that creates a sense of urgency without ever undermining its Rolls-Royce peerage . The drive-train , ZF 8-speed gear box and both front and rear steered axles work collaboratively to adjust the levels of engagement depending on throttle and steering inputs . Changes to suspension components and settings add to the suite of dynamic technologies that ensure an appropriate balance between dynamism and refinement . The result is an extremely well-mannered tourer at low speeds and a vivid driver 's device when pressed . To bolster confidence when exploiting Cullinan 's alter ego , the braking bite point has been raised and pedal travel decreased . Redesigned brake disc ventilation also allows consistency in these changes while braking at elevated temperatures .

Los Angeles City Councilmen Paul Koretz and Gilbert Cedillo introduced a resolution Wednesday asking Major League Baseball to award the 2017 and 2018 World Series titles to the Dodgers . The league concluded this week that the Houston Astros used a camera to illicitly steal signs from opposing catchers during the 2017 season , which ended with the Astros defeating the Dodgers in the World Series . According to the league , the sign-stealing system was orchestrated by then-Astros bench coach Alex Cora , who served as manager of the Boston Red Sox in 2018 , which ended with the Red Sox defeating the Dodgers in the World Series . The league initially suspended Astros ' general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager A.J. Hinch for a year , but the club quickly fired the pair . The Astros were also fined $ 5 million and ordered to forfeit its first - and second-round draft picks for two years . Cora , who has yet to be punished by MLB , parted ways with the Red Sox this week following the release of the league investigation . Koretz conceded that it 's `` uncharted territory '' to request the league to strip two teams of their titles and award them to another , but he said it would be fair to give the Los Angeles players a championship after being cheated . `` MLB did take it seriously by -LRB- issuing -RRB- significant suspensions , which were followed by major league clubs firing managers , '' Koretz told City News Service . `` There have been scandals in the past over the century-plus that we 've had Major League Baseball in this country . I 'm not sure if we 've had this documented an effort to steal two World Series , and we know the results . ... I think that would be an appropriate payback . I think this really besmirches the national pastime and the most historic sport in American history , and there has to be a message that this is n't allowed . '' Koretz , a lifelong Dodger fan , said even the players who knew of the scheme to steal pitch signs but did not come forward about it should be held accountable . He said the cheating likely robbed longtime Dodgers players of a shot at the title , but he conceded there 's no way to know . According to Forbes Magazine , it 's highly unlikely that the teams will have to forfeit their World Series titles , as MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred is `` exceptionally limited in making it happen without going to war with the MLBPA , '' the union that represents the league 's players . The resolution does not call for the city to initiate any legal action , although some Dodger fans have suggested going to court over the matter . The last time the Dodgers won the World Series was in 1988 , when they defeated the Oakland Athletics .", "url": "https://www.fox5ny.com/news/l-a-councilmen-want-astros-red-sox-world-series-titles-awarded-to-dodgers", "kws": ["Dodgers", "longtime^^Dodgers^^players", "Houston^^Astros", "Red^^Sox", "Major^^League^^Baseball", "MLB", "Oakland^^Athletics", "LOS^^ANGELES", "The^^league", "manager^^A.J.^^Hinch", "L.A.", "Major^^League", "A.J.^^Hinch", "World^^Series", "Jeff^^Luhnow", "Boston", "draft^^picks", "catchers", "bench^^coach", "this^^week"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Baseball": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Baseball_MLB": 1.0}}}

0.0	{"docid": "0NrPtbSE", "title": "Real Housewives Of New Jersey Recap : Mama Drama", "content": "Margaret Josephs and Danielle Staub are at WAR on The Real Housewives of New Jersey . The fallout from last week 's episode will likely last all season . It 's a bloodbath in the Garden State . Teresa Giudice is directly in the middle , and her friendship with Marge is in big jeopardy . Teresa 's somewhat blind loyalty to Danielle is mind boggling . What is she doing here ? Why does she want to be her ally so badly ? It 's also only a matter of time before some of the other women have a falling out . For the most part everyone 's getting along right now . That 's going to change . It would n't be Housewives if it was n't going to . It 's probably a safe bet that it 'll be Jennifer Aydin who finds herself at odds with someone . Will it be Jackie Goldschneider again ? Although someone new would be more exciting . Melissa ca n't believe that Teresa is going so hard to defend Danielle . I ca n't either . What is she thinking ? Also , throwing water on Jennifer to prove a point was so out of line . That 's just not how people should be behaving . Melissa and Joe get the results of their fertility tests . Everything 's cool with Melissa , but Joe Gorga 's sperm count was super down . Naturally , Joe is Mr. Caveman so this hurt his pride . Even his kids found it hilarious . However , I do n't think Melissa and Joe have any plans on actually having another child . Just something to make her appear relevant for another season . Margaret invites Jackie over to her house to talk about having a Mother 's Day drag brunch . What a fascinating concept . She 's so extra on so many levels . I love it though . Margaret 's not inviting Teresa to this , which is n't going to go over well . I get that Teresa 's friends with Danielle , but you have to let some s ** t go . Why let something so petty ruin a longtime friendship ? Jackie 's inviting all of the women to The Hamptons , and she 's including Teresa . I kind of love this . She 's going to force Margaret and Teresa to be face to face . Obviously it could go seriously wrong , but they need to talk . I think without psycho Danielle in the room , they can reach common ground . Remove the toxicity from your life Teresa ! Teresa and Dolores Catania meet at the spa , and they want their kids to date . Gia already finds Frankie hot , so let it happen I guess . Jackie calls them to officially invite them to The Hamptons . How shady is Jackie though ? She brings up the drag brunch and knows damn well that she 's not inviting Teresa . She 's like `` oh I did n't know '' . That 's some actually bull right there . Jackie with some SNAKE moves . Jackie is low key thirsty for the drama . She and Teresa may have `` made up '' , but she really enjoyed rubbing her exclusion it . Everything Jackie does comes across so calculated . She strikes at the right time every time . I thought I liked her last season , but she 's trying too hard this year . Simmer down girl . Margaret 's drag brunch looks so fabulous . It looks very Alice in Wonderland with a drag twist . It 's everything I wold have expected and more from her . Back at Teresa 's , her daughters prepare a delicious Mother 's Day meal and card that makes her cry . It 's really sad that Margaret would n't just invite Teresa to her thing . It would 've been such a time to bond and make up . Excluded someone from an event is kind of a big deal . That sends a POWERFUL message . Joe Giudice calls and of course fights with Teresa again . The montage of how many times Joe said awful things about Teresa is kind of sad to watch . She took a lot of cruelty from him for years . She honestly would 've walked away from that marriage years ago . Good riddance bro . Jennifer 's mom looks so out of place at this event . Given her stance on the LGBTQ community , I wonder what 's going through her mind . I love Jennifer 's push to open up her mom 's views this season . She 's really coming through as an ally . Her daughter too ! This event reminds me of a Jersey version of something Lisa Vanderpump would do . If LVP was in Jersey , this is what I 'd imagine I 'd see . Drag queens and ros\u00e9 . Margaret thinks that Teresa 's really changed since they 've met . Teresa has n't really changed . Margaret just has n't seen it . The peace , calm , and tranquility Tre is a thing of the past . The Teresa of the past is back , and she 's ready to take down Marge . Margaret and Marge Sr. 's relationship is so bizarre . She does n't sound like she was really a mother to her . She was more into the partying than she was being a mom . Ugh . So relatable . I feel that sooooo much . I love Marge . Sr regardless . She seems like someone I 'd enjoy having a drink with and hearing her crazy stories . Playing Melissa 's song during the drag performance was EVERYTHING . It 's such a vibe . Her music career did n't really go anywhere , but I really do have that on my Spotify playlist . I 'm not ashamed . David Principe misses almost every event that the women have . He 's never really there for Dolores . This relationship is so blah . She tells him sometimes it 's better being his patient than his girlfriend . I do n't think he knows how to be in a healthy relationship . Dolores is never getting a commitment from this man . I was right . Jennifer 's mother did n't know that drag queen 's were men . What rock is this women living under ? Even if you do n't support it , you should know what a drag queen is . Like what ? Is she serious ? Jennifer confronts her mom about pretending like she does n't know her son is gay . She compares him being gay to having a sick child . Ugh . This is so backwards . Old fashioned sounds a lot like bigoted to me . It 's wild to me how much emotion comes from her mom over this . I did n't realize in 2020 that people could still be so close minded . Marge Sr. is moving . Look . I do n't want to be rude . However , he current apartment is a whole mess . Hoarders could do a full special on this . How does she even move in her apartment ? She 's moving like really soon , but she has so much work to do . As much as it needs to be done , Margaret is being a little aggressive with her mother about it all . Like chill . Jackie is rich bitch . She spends $ 50,000 a month on her Hampton house . That 's such an astronomical amount of money for a house you hardly use . I want to be THAT . I do n't know where that cash comes from , but I need it . Teresa complains to Dolores about Joe and how the girls take his side . They definitely have a glamorized version of what their father is like . He 's been away for so long , so their vision is a little skewed . Joe is not the saint they 've made him out to be in their minds . He 's actually kind of a super douche . All of the sudden it looks like Jackie having money is going to be a storyline . Why though ? What does it even matter ? What 's even the entertainment value of that as a topic ? Someone fill me in . The moment Teresa enters the door , she brings up Margaret not inviting her to drag brunch . `` Thank you for not inviting me '' . Fighting words . Teresa does n't want the goodie bag Margaret brought for her . Teresa came in hot . I think the old Teresa will be joining us for the remainder of the season . FINALLY . TELL US -- SHOULD MARGARET HAVE INVITED TERESA TO BRUNCH ? SHOULD TERESA AND MARGARET MAKE UP ?

Luckily , we have online forums where people fill us in on the creepy tales and stories we should read up on if we want to scare the sh*t out of each other . Here are 15 scary unsolved mysteries that might never be solved . Click on the links in the titles to read more about these topics . These answers come to us from the Buzzfeed Community . 1 . The disappearance of Bobby Dunbar . `` I just find it crazy that we 'll never quite know if the kid who was returned to the Dunbars was really their son or the son of another woman who they won against in court . If that was n't Bobby , what happened to Bobby ? And if it was Bobby , why did he seem so confused about it ? '' 2 . The Somerton Man . `` The dude from Australia ! The Somerton Man ! He was found on the beach , dead . All signs pointed to poisoning but they did n't find anything in the tox report . All the tags in his clothes were cut out , there was no way of identifying him . Then they found a line from a book in his pocket or something . They say he could have been a spy but we 'll probably never know . '' 3 . The Yuba County Five . `` Five young men went missing in California after seemingly being chased up a mountain in their car . Months later , four of their five bodies were found malnourished , but the fifth has never been found . People think since the men were mentally challenged they were targeted or that the 5th man murdered them , but that theory seems unlikely . '' 4 . The death of Rebecca Zahau .

There was a mysterious message written in black paint on her bedroom door reading , `` She saved him . Can you save her ? '' 5 . The death of the Black Dahlia . `` This one is obviously super well known but the fact that no one knows who the killer is is wild and what was done to her was so brutal and creepy . '' 6 . The disappearance of Timmothy Pitzen . View this post on Instagram DNA tests have revealed the person claiming to be a long lost boy is actually a 23-year-old man with a serious criminal record . He was found in Kentucky yesterday and told police he was Timmothy Pitzen who vanished 8 years ago . #TimmothyPitzen # 7NEWS A post shared by 7NEWS Sydney -LRB- @ 7newssyd -RRB- on Apr 5 , 2019 at 12:32 pm PDT `` Everyone needs to read this case , it is nuts . Amy Fry-Pitzen checked her 6-year-old son out of school and three days later her body was found in a hotel where she had died of apparent suicide . A note was found next to her saying that Timmothy was safe with people who would care for him and he would never be found . They have never been able to find him , or any remains of him . '' 7 . Australia 's Mr. Cruel . `` Many people have seen the police sketch of the modified balaclava that he wore in one of the kidnappings -LRB- the one with white stitches to conceal any potential identifying markers -- super creepy ! -RRB- , but his crime spree and its sudden stop is haunting . Its unsolved nature adds more to its overall creepiness . '' 8 . The 1962 Alcatraz prison break . `` Along with their friend Allen West , they planned to dig a hole using spoons into their cell walls and climb up the walls onto the roof . Using loads of raincoats they also planned to take all their belongings and make a raft and swim away . West never made it as his hole was too small , but the others have still not been found . There are many weird things involved in this story -- someone claiming to be Clarence wrote a letter to the police a few years back stating he is alive and that he would tell them where he is if they did n't arrest him and that the other two have died . '' 9 . The Lane Bryant murders . `` It happened on a Saturday morning in the southern suburbs of Chicago . A person walked into the store , held people hostage for a short time , and murdered everyone in there . The person got away and was never found . A manager , who was n't even scheduled to come in that day , called 911 and just said , ` Lane Bryant , hurry . ' One person survived the shooting but the person has not been identified . They 're not even sure if the killer was a man or a woman . The 911 call is super chilling . '' 10 . The disappearance of Susy Tomassi . `` Susy was 73 years old with slight dementia . She owned a restaurant called The Quilted Giraffe with her husband and was known for walking from the restaurant to other stores . One day , she was seen on camera walking away from her restaurant and literally just vanished . Nobody knows what happened .

The death of Gareth Williams . `` The spy in the duffel bag . His naked remains were found in a duffel bag , padlocked from the outside , in the bath of a safe house . No forensic evidence was found that pointed towards it being an accident , and the key to the padlock was found underneath his body . The official cause of death was ` probably an accident ' but a KGB agent claims he was killed by the Russian SVR . '' 12 . The fate of the Sodder children . `` The whole case is quite the rabbit hole with so many lies and cover-ups and unanswered questions . Someone out there has answers ! It 's been over 70 years , so if the children survived , they 've probably passed on now . But I 'm still so curious about what happened ! '' 13 . The incident at Dyatlov Pass . `` Nine experienced trekkers were found dead . There was no sign of foul play , but most of them were missing clothes , some of them had extreme injuries , and the tents were ripped open from the inside . It happened over 50 years ago and to this day is still unsolved ! '' 14 . The death of JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey . `` ARE WE EVER GOING TO FIND OUT WHO DID IT ?! Did the mom write the ransom ? Why was the random note written at the house ? Why did JonBen\u00e9t have pineapple in her stomach ? Who gave her the pineapple ? How did the DNA on her clothing get there , who does the DNA belong to ? Was she being abused ? WHY DOES HER BROTHER SOUND SO CREEPY AND WHY DOES HE SMILE SO MUCH ?!

I was leaving a teaching position in Beijing , and moving back to Oaxaca , Mexico , my husband 's hometown . I said I was going to `` live from writing . '' I had no idea what that really meant , but it was a leap I wanted to take . We lived in a $ 150-a-month apartment in a scruffy colonia on the outskirts of the city . The financial bar I had set for myself was around $ 500 a month . I met this at first by grading practice TESOL exams online . This meant hours upon hours of listening to nervous Koreans analyze Harry Potter or explain worm digestion . I was so bored I pulled out enough of my own hair to give myself a bald spot . From here , I moved on to writing practice TESOL exams , then practice SAT exams for a Korean contractor who worked for the Princeton Review in Asia . This took less time and paid more , leaving hours of the day free for me to write overwrought and purplish essays about my travel experiences . Nights , Jorge and I ate tlayudas in a nearby se\u00f1ora 's garage and drank forties of Corona . A few months into my full-time writing life , I got a gig as a blogger and editor at a travel site . I learned WordPress and basic HTML and got to publish my overwrought and purplish essays on a platform for an actual audience . In the meantime , I started my second personal blog , named for -- cringe with me here -- a Julio Cort\u00e1zar short story . My blog allowed me to publish experimental essays in Spanglish and wax philosophical about the old man at the market who carved wooden airplanes . It allowed me , in other words , to suck . My writing sucked for a long time in diverse ways , with the occasional sentence or paragraph or maybe even mini-essay that was half decent and resonant with the promise of the actually good . In late 2009 , I went to a goat slaughter at an old hacienda in Huajuapan de L\u00e9on , a dry and dusty city a few hours from Oaxaca . The slaughter was an annual event in which local herders brought their goats to be killed en masse , their meat and skin and blood and bones all put immediately to use . It allowed me , in other words , to suck . The scene at the hacienda seemed straight out of the 1700s . The killing was more humane than I 'd expected ; one swift knife in the throat and the animal died instantly . Hundreds of goats were killed simultaneously so that none had to anticipate suffering . In courtyards around the hacienda , women carved the skin from the bones and hung it like underwear to dry , men etched out internal organs and tossed them in blue buckets . Kids raced around playing tag in bloody huaraches . I took notes nonstop in my little notebook . We returned to the city late at night , and the next morning I woke up at six and started writing . It took me three days to complete a narrative of the experience . I wrote with a concentration , intensity , and focus I 'd never had before , but for which all the sucky writing of the past year -LRB- and the previous decade , in bits and pieces -RRB- had prepared me . On a whim , I applied to six MFA programs and submitted the goat essay as my writing sample . One by one the rejections rolled in , until only one school was left . I not only had to get in , I had to get funding , which was n't guaranteed , so I figured it was probably all over . Then one day I returned from my run and opened my email and there was an acceptance from the University of Pittsburgh , guaranteeing me full funding for the duration of the three-year program . I screamed . I jumped around the apartment screaming . I dragged Jorge out of bed and we ran down the street to our friends ' apartment and we all drank shots of mezcal at nine in the morning . I would have three years to write , full-time , funded . In 2010 Jorge and I moved back to the U.S. for my program . The following year , I got an internship at Harper 's Magazine and started Vela , my own magazine of nonfiction writing by women . The idea of the magazine was to counter some of the frustration I 'd felt in New York at the narrowness of what might be called the legacy literary world , its white , male Ivy-Leagueness . I invited five women writers I knew and respected to participate , and the concept was for us to have a collective portfolio of our skills . I was idealistic in the way of the clueless outsider . I just wanted our small group of women to show that we could write . We published stories about abusive relationships . About the Zapatistas . About stepparenting . About chronic illness . About gold mines in Peru and gangs in Ecuador and the lingering impacts of genocide in Cambodia . None of our work was paid . Our crew put in hours and hours of writing , of editing each other 's work , of copyediting and designing and promoting and participating in epic rambly email threads . All of us had day jobs : grad school , teaching , editing . We wanted to prove to ourselves and the gatekeepers that we could do it . And we did . One by one , we grew more successful : We published in major magazines . We won grants . Some of us went on to write books , others got teaching jobs . Meanwhile we opened the magazine up for submissions . Had we been a standard literary journal , pay would 've been a nonissue . Literary journals rarely pay and if they do , they pay enough to subsidize , say , a new pair of jeans . But we operated in a liminal zone -- most of us did n't consider ourselves journalists and we did n't define our magazine or its mission as journalism , but most of our work was n't in the more academic or highly `` literary '' essayistic style either . We were somewhere between literary journalism and travel writing and essay writing and narrative , and this ambiguity of genre had been part of the point in the first place : to push on the boundaries of those categories . It seemed clear that journalism had to be funded and well-compensated . Literary writing , less so , although why was n't exactly clear . I got hundreds of emails after we 'd opened to submissions from writers who demanded to know how much we paid . Many of these emails consisted of semi-belligerent offers to write `` guest posts '' about personal travel experiences for a certain fee . When I said we did n't pay , I often got angry rants in response , once from a woman who had no significant bylines or books , but who charged upward of $ 2,000 for her writing workshops . She called our magazine a scam . Meanwhile , I read the explosion of think and opinion pieces on paying writers . I was about to graduate from my MFA program and become a full-time freelancer . By this point , five years into `` living from writing , '' I wanted to be paid for my creative work . I knew I would n't write for my own magazine if it did n't pay . And so we ran a Kickstarter exclusively with the point of paying writers , and we raised $ 28,000 . With that money we were able to publish some extraordinary work from writers we might not have gotten otherwise : two essays led to major book deals , others led to grants and to longer , more in-depth journalistic stories with bigger magazines . Ultimately , our biggest mistake was not budgeting any money for ourselves : We 'd been bombarded with commentary about the importance of paying writers , but not editors . The latter worked for a paltry stipend or no salary at all . None of us had the time or the desire to take on a full-time business role . Instead , we put the magazine on hiatus while we tried to figure out future funding and plans . In the meantime , dozens of other magazines sprouted up , all in that space between journalism and the literary essay . Most of these advertised boldly and proudly that they paid -- but upon investigation , the pay was $ 50 . Maybe $ 100 or $ 200 for a long-form piece . The conversation about `` writing for free '' continued , now focused on the insult of being asked to write `` for exposure , '' with the usual rants on Twitter and think pieces making the rounds . The idea of an experienced writer being asked to do her professional work for a major media corporation for `` exposure '' is ludicrous and insulting . But all the bombast and pressure and rhetoric around writing `` for free '' ignores a few key realities : Many professional and experienced writers are being asked to write for very little , which is somehow celebrated as `` payment '' but is in fact nowhere near a functional wage ; and many inexperienced and early-career writers might not be doing work that merits payment . The latter is a reality not many people want to discuss . My early work sucked . No one would have paid for it , and I would n't blame them . I wrote hundreds of thousands of pages that would , were I to print them out , fill an entire room of my house . Little snippets of them ended up published . The 70,000-word book I wrote for my MFA thesis ended up as a 7,000-word Harper 's Magazine story . Bits and pieces of work I 'd written about Spanglish and Mexico and my marriage ended up as an Oxford American essay . But most of this work was compost -- stinky , rotting , coffee-ground and broken-egg essays feeding richer work down the line . It was n't simply that it sucked . It was also that I wrote it for myself : to find out how I saw , what I cared about , how I strung my ideas and scenes together . I wrote it for the basic purpose of trying to figure out what mattered and how to convey that it mattered on the page . But most of this work was compost -- stinky , rotting , coffee-ground and broken-egg essays feeding richer work down the line . I believe -- I stake my existence on believing -- that art should be compensated , and compensated with a living wage . This is not a given , which is why I live in Pittsburgh , why I have a part-time job that miraculously provides health insurance . I no longer write `` for free . '' I have started , in fact , demanding more pay for almost every piece , knowing that as a woman I 'll likely be offered less , and knowing that if I do n't ask I surely wo n't get it . At the same time , writing with money as the end goal and predominant measure of value changes the nature of the game . Maybe this is n't always negative ; commercial pressure can work as a valuable creative restraint , forcing writers out of solipsistic indulgences . But thinking only of where a piece will sell , what I can write to make the money I need -- urgently need , right now -- to pay for our roof , also makes me wonder why I am still doing this . Why live this life of a writer , so poorly compensated in money and acclaim , so uncertain , so competitive , so crazy-making , if I 'm not even doing it because I believe in it ? If I 'm not doing it because I 'm writing something I have to write to figure out what it means to be human ? Why do it if it 's just a job ? And yet at the same time , of course it 's just a job -- this is the secret I did n't know when I began . It requires the same grind and tedium as a job . The same negotiations for pay and promotion . The same boredom and frustration . But sometimes I need to remember that if it is just this , the meaning can bottom out -- then I wonder , why do it at all . There has to be some risk , some leap that may not necessarily be compensated . That is uncertain and scary . Writing that matters is often risky -- its saleability may not be immediately obvious , its style may be unconventional , it may break with standard forms and narratives . It does what it has to do to figure itself out . Certainly , there is phenomenal writing that does n't necessarily follow these rules , that may pop up within very familiar genres and categories . There is also plenty of writing that flaunts convention and fails to achieve anything of importance . Yet writing for a living often means writing , ultimately , what the market will bear . It means internalizing the stylistic and rhetorical and intellectual underpinnings of the literary behemoths , then shaping one 's work in their image . It means putting the cart of audience -- and the style of `` high magazine-ese '' -- before the horse of the idea , of the struggle to make sense of the intractable . It can shrink the work into manageable and predictable frames , and this can explain why so much of what is published and shared feels so familiar , and fails to generate that feeling of the whole world having been rattled and made new . The other day , I went to a talk by a well-known writer who has become a guru on the business of writing , and she talked quite a bit about audience : She hinted that writers who do n't consider their audience are n't savvy enough businesspeople , and maybe even self-centered or obsessed with prestige . But I wondered how it is possible to create authentic work , with that essential spark of the urgent and the curious , that is centered first and foremost on an audience 's imagined desires . Trying to derive a work from the question Who 's the audience for x and what will they like ? instead of from a thorny idea , or an overpowering emotion , or a story that feels vital seems to me to quash the work 's life and purpose . It becomes purely commercial . Trying to derive a work from the question Who 's the audience for x and what will they like ? instead of from a thorny idea , or an overpowering emotion , or a story that feels vital seems to me to quash the work 's life and purpose . It becomes purely commercial . I Skyped the other day with my little brother , a fellow artist who lives in Sweden and works as a barista and reaps all the benefits of the Scandanavian welfare state while flailing around trying to make a career out of music . `` I know it 's bad when you 're Skypeing me at 1:30 p.m. , '' he told me , meaning productivity , career-obsessed me , normally squeezing every last drop of potential wordage and progress out of the day , must be having a crisis if I am sitting in slippers in my backyard at 1 p.m. talking to him . He grinned through a mouthful of frozen pizza . I went on one of the flights of what-is-this-life fancy I can only indulge with him . I talked about Richard Powers 's The Overstory , and how after I read it I had that uncanny feeling of both how limited my work and life are and how profound and big the true mission and scope of art can be . It simultaneously made me want to give up -- if I can never do that , why bother ? -- and to forget all my woes and keep going , with a realigned compass focused not on publication but on that feeling I had each night I put The Overstory down . Why live this life , why embark on this madness of writing full-time , constant rejection , constant financial stress , the constant tug of pettiness and ego , if I 'm not doing it because I 'm trying to get at that essence of connection or meaning or mystery that makes a reader put down a book and just sit for a while and stare , or cry , or call her mother ? Why do it if not for that ? That , at the end of the day , has very little to do with money . At the same time , when I have finished a piece of writing now , I am fully aware of the skill and the expertise required to create it -- I can not imagine publishing it for free . It is my livelihood . I need it to be recognized with adequate pay . I need the pay to fund my existence . The pay becomes the recognition and validation that reinforces the meaning of the work . The job and the passion blur in confusing ways , helixed so tightly it 's hard to unwind them . The irony is that the further I get into my career and the more I really need and demand money , the more I come to question what this means for my writing , what I believe and care about as a writer , what I am exchanging for what . It becomes harder and harder to write in that pure void of ideas and perseverance without knowing when the money will come and from where , trusting that eventually , if the work is good enough , it will come . Trusting that if and when it does , it means I 'm doing it right . That it 's `` worth it . '' Eventually , the money has always come , but it has always not been enough , and I have always kept at it anyway believing eventually it will be , and on and on . Recently , I started a newsletter . I did it in part because of all the pressure to kick off the promotion process for my second book , but also because for years now I 've been wanting to write the kinds of essays I used to write : introspective , heartfelt , unabashedly Midwestern in spirit , with guest appearances by my dad and Annie Dillard . I did n't write them and did n't start the newsletter for years because I would n't be paid , and I thought I should be concentrating only on what I could sell . Yet in starting the newsletter I rediscovered the joy of writing as a fundamental way of being in and moving through the world . It felt so unexpectedly good . I wrote what I wanted , what came from the gut , without any nagging train of thought in the head about who would read and where that would position me and how that would advance my career and what opportunity would open up . I just wrote for the joy of paying attention to my everyday life , thinking about what matters . No professional writer or artist should be working for free . But neither should they be writing for $ 50 or $ 150 or $ 200 , or for a paltry monthly stipend . Instead of painting a stark dichotomy between paid and unpaid work , I wonder if we could think of artistic careers as moving along a spectrum or timeline , from early work that might be funded by other means -- MFAs , day jobs -- to beginning work that might be paid a small amount , to professional work that should be paid a living wage . A publication offering $ 50 for an essay ca n't announce `` We pay ! '' as a sort of uniform accomplishment ; the mere act of paying does n't necessarily make the work more valid nor does it properly compensate the work . When the focus becomes so much on the act of payment as a type of validation , not only do other metrics of value get lost -- creative freedom and exploration and support -- but what it means to pay meaningfully and fairly gets lost as well . I wrote what I wanted , what came from the gut , without any nagging train of thought in the head about who would read and where that would position me and how that would advance my career and what opportunity would open up . I just wrote for the joy of paying attention to my everyday life , thinking about what matters . I do n't regret writing for free all those years when I was figuring out how to write . But I have more complicated feelings about writing full-time now for what amounts to barely a living wage . I find it much harder in the early middle of my career to sustain and justify this work -- I 'm not a 28-year-old graduate student who can live on the same pizza for a week anymore . I have a child . I have a freaking mortgage . I went out for a beer the other night with a friend , also about 10 years into her writing and editing career , very accomplished and very financially unstable , and she said , `` We 're too far in now to back out ! '' It 's true . It feels like we ca n't give up . But the path forward is so uncertain -- success looks so distinct for each particular artist and may not have any correlation with money . I was whining and moaning with my husband the other night about my career and when I would `` make it '' and he said , `` Maybe you have made it , '' and I realized that yes , maybe I have . Had anyone told me in graduate school I 'd be writing for the magazines I write for and publishing my second book , I 'd have let my head fill with self-congratulatory fantasies of greatness . Now , I spend most mornings writing at a plastic table on our front porch with a fitted sheet as a tablecloth . I am constantly hustling . Sometimes I am fulfilled in the way people can be fulfilled by a single word : writer . Often I am keening anxiously toward the future . This is an object lesson in the human condition of forever wanting more and never being aware of what is going on right here right now , but it 's also a lesson in the improbability and uncertainty of `` living from writing '' or from any art , of how really going at it with passion and dedication offers no guarantees or certainty or promise of stability . Yes , many artists and writers accept this as common knowledge -- perhaps even as a badge of honor -- starting out , but there is a very big difference between knowing it at an idealistic 28 and knowing it at 36 with a child , uncertain health insurance , and a house . I am fully aware now of the precise contours , dimensions , nooks , crannies of the gap between my ideals and financial and commercial realities . Much time is spent navigating that gap , possibly as much time as I spend writing . Writing for free , or for very little , is something I would not and can not do now -- and yet at the same time , I long for the inhibition of that time when my writing was n't so hitched to my ability to pay for childcare or buy groceries . I have found it the most difficult to sustain my belief in the larger purpose of what I am doing when I am also desperately trying to get it to pay me and pay me enough . Yet at the same time , I do see progress : I am making a living . I am living from writing , my writing , still the writing I want to do and also writing I sell . But the balance is delicate and fragile . It is not so much between writing for free and writing for pay : it is between writing that makes the act of writing worthwhile , that feels somehow essential to deeper human understanding , and receiving sufficient money for this writing -- between the very solitary act of making something I need to make out of a personal urgency and the needs and desires and economic whims of thousands of other people . This is the cost and the meaning of `` living from writing . '' I keep doing it , because I do n't know what else to do , because I am not qualified to do anything else , because I have come this far and I do n't want to give up now . I keep doing it in the hopes that someday that elusive balance will be struck between financial stability and creative freedom . In the meantime , I try to keep my compass as finely tuned to the north of what troubles me , moves me , confuses me , even as I draw up Google spreadsheets , as I write the tentative notes to editors asking for just a little more , as I cling to that ledge of living from writing and keep trying to peek over the top . * * * Sarah Menkedick is the author of Ordinary Insanity : Fear and the Silent Crisis of Motherhood in America , forthcoming from Pantheon in April 2020 .

It should be a no-brainer that discrimination should n't be permitted against someone because of their sexual orientation or gender identify . But , here in America , I guess some of us do n't understand that . The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide this year on three cases on whether it 's legal to fire workers because of their sexual orientation or gender identity . USA Today reported that experts see this as setting the stage for `` a landmark civil rights ruling that will serve as the true test of where the nation stands on LGBTQ rights . '' USA Today reported these sad facts : * About half of LGBTQ people in the United States live in a state where they legally can be fired , denied a promotion , refused training or harassed at their jobs -- all because of their gender identity and sexual orientation . * Only 21 states , D.C. and two territories have laws on the books explicitly banning bias in the workplace based on sexual orientation and gender identity . * One quarter of LGBTQ people reported experiencing discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity , according to a 2018 report from the Movement Advancement Project . That 's an embarrassment , especially since more than 90 percent of Americans believe gays and lesbians should have equal rights in terms of job opportunities , according to a 2019 Gallup poll . More than half believe new civil rights laws are needed to reduce discrimination against lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender people . A Marquette Law School poll shows the public opposes the Supreme Court allowing business owners with a religious objection to LGBTQ people to deny them services , 57-34 percent . The sticking point in this debate seems to be the people who see homosexuality as an offense against God . Their concern about what goes on in other people 's bedrooms is so intense that some of them fly past the `` hate the sin , lover the sinner '' part and just hate the sinner . Why else would they want to make discrimination legal against the LGBTQ community ? Some might tell you they 're concerned about a `` slippery slope '' that starts with selling them a wedding cake and then could steamroll into all kinds of things . I 'm more concerned about a slippery slope that goes in the other direction . From no cake , to you ca n't go to school here , to you ca n't get medical care here , to you ca n't live here , to you 're fired , to who knows what else . Democrats have tried to address this matter by passing the Equality Act in the House . It would amend other civil rights laws to include explicit protections for sexual orientations and gender identity . The bill faces opposition in the Republican-controlled Senate Meanwhile , members of the LGBTQ community are left to figure out why the same God who created them also considers them an abomination . Makes you wonder . Does n't it ? There should n't be any question about this : Americans deserve the same protections from discrimination based on their sexual orientation and gender identity as they do on the old standbys of race , sex , national origin and religion . So , if you 're in Congress and you believe this , you 'll change the law . If you do n't change the law , you 're simply giving the go-head for some of our citizens to not just hate a particular group but to punish them by ruining their lives anyway they can .

'' Gagnon was one of 15 bishops -- mostly from Europe and North America -- taking part in an annual week-long visit by bishops to support the Holy Land 's local Christian communities .

Still , despite the many political issues and economic difficulties people face in their daily lives , Gagnon said he was struck by the real sense of joy and positivity he sensed within Gaza 's Catholic community . `` They have a real sense of who they are and what their identity is , '' said Gagnon . `` They provide wonderful opportunities for people in Gaza , both Christians and non-Christians , through their schools and charitable organizations .

That said , I was n't completely against the idea of a Robert Downey Jr. led spin on the book by Hugh Lofting . However , going by the early Twitter reactions that are coming in for Dolittle , I am guessing I am the only one who has some level of optimism about the movie . Dolittle is primarily inspired by ` The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle ' where the titular character , played by Downey Jr. , will use his power of being able to talk to animals and sense of adventure to find a cure for Queen Victoria .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrQciAb", "title": "Former GOP strategist Rick Wilson : `` F**king hating '' Trump is the key to winning in 2020", "content": "Rick Wilson has helped countless Republicans win elections over the years as one of the most sought-after GOP media consultants . His work , by his own admission , has contributed to the hyper-partisan , zero-sum political world that we live in today . But that was all B.T. , or `` Before Trump . '' Wilson is now using his mastery of the dark arts of politics to defeat the leader of the very party he helped build , as laid out in his new book , `` Running Against the Devil : A Plot to Save America from Trump -- and Democrats from Themselves . '' Wilson 's previous book , `` Everything Trump Touches Dies , '' reached No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list in 2018 . He recently visited Salon 's New York studio to shared his blunt , practical approach to beating Trump . His book is not about ideology , he emphasized , It 's about how to defeat the racist , sexist , grifter who threatens the future of our nation . It 's truly that simple . Forget policy papers and wonky policy discussions , Wilson says . To beat Trump , make the entire election about his corruption , sexism , cruelty and bigotry . Wilson believes that if the 2020 election is framed as a choice between four more years of toxic Trump or another person -- virtually any person -- Americans will pick the non-Trump on the ballot . He advises Democrats to `` forget national polls '' and focus on winning the Electoral College , not the popular vote -- meaning , essentially , that they must ignore the deep blue states on the coasts and put all available resources into winning key swing states like Wisconsin , Pennsylvania , Michigan and Ohio . Whether Wilson 's `` tough love '' approach -LRB- as he puts it -RRB- encourages you or enrages you , watch our Salon Talks episode or read a transcript of our conversation below , edited as usual for clarity and length . I have to say with all sincerity , `` Running Against the Devil '' is a must-read book for progressives , moderates , anyone who wants a roadmap to defeat Donald Trump . If that 's your focus , this is the book you have to read . That 's my focus . And the book is n't about ideology . It is n't about policy . It is about a practical , political approach to beating Donald Trump , which I think people on the left , the center , and the few of us on the right who held onto a shred of our principles believe is vital . Was the Republican Party just looking for the white supremacist savior like Trump ? Were they primed for this ? Or did he really change the party ? You know , it was like a bunch of black swans landed at one time . You have the confluence of reality TV , of Fox News , of Donald Trump with celebrity culture , of a field of Republicans who -- none of them were superstars at the end of the day , no matter how much we wanted them to be . You had Hillary Clinton as the -LSB- Democratic -RSB- nominee , who had this 30-year pre-existing condition where the Republicans had turned her into Satan incarnate with their voters . So this moment happened , and Donald Trump 's moral failings and his racism and everything else about this guy led a party that had been told for years , the only thing you 're missing is somebody who will blow up everything . You just want to destroy everything . I mean , it 's the Joker candidacy . And they got it . Right now there are three categories of Republicans . A fairly small fraction of them , like a third maybe , really believe in this crap . Really believe that Trumpism is the new way . They treat him as a king . A third of the Republicans are terrified of the guy . They are so scared of a tweet that they hide under their covers every day . And a third of them are like opportunists . They want the judges , they want the regulations for their donors , that sort of crap . The confluence of all those things that came together at one moment gave us this terrible , terrible thing . And look , all of us who worked in the party for a long time , we recognized there were different fractions and factions in the party . I 've never been a social conservative , I 'm not an evangelical . Everybody has given up in the Republican Party of today . All of those predicates . They do n't believe in anything . They believe in Trump , whether they believe in his terror over them or their love of him . It leads to a personality cult , not a political party . As you worked as a political consultant doing the dark arts -- and we talked about that with your first book -- you , on some level , contributed to the hyper-partisan climate . Sure . This monster that you built , in a way , found the living manifestation that could lead it . Yeah , unfortunately , there was always a dynamic pressure inside the party . The fiscal people and the individual liberty people would keep the social conservatives from getting too out of control . The social conservatives would keep the fiscal people from getting too out of control . The foreign policy people , this tripartite internal , the three-legged stool they used to call it . Well with Trump , that all fell apart . It 's all gone . It 's all id . It 's everything that 's in their heads . They 're told , `` You can have whatever you want , we 're going to burn it all down . '' And that 's what they 're doing . Are you still a Republican ? I 'm done . You 're out of the party ? Look , I have n't changed my voter registration yet , mainly because I want to vote against the son of a bitch twice . But I 'm not a Republican in any political sense anymore . Is the party gone ? Yeah , the party 's dead . The party 's gone . I do n't see any pathway for it to come back . There is nobody in this party who feels a need for reconciliation . They do n't want to face their truth . Calling me a former Republican is accurate in every meaningful way , but nobody in the party wants to look at what 's been created . They do n't want to look at the expansion of government , the expansion of debt , the expansion of executive power , the expansion of mainstream abuse of people . All those things are repugnant to a conservative . I 'm not doing the `` no true Scotsman . '' I 'm doing the actual heart of Burkean conservatism , which is individual liberty and respect and dignity should be part of what you believe in . This guy is the antithesis of all that . He 's breeding a generation of people who believe abuse is beneficial . Cruelty is his currency and he enjoys it . To me , one of his greatest sins is misleading otherwise good Americans to believe in this . Sure , I think that 's a good point . And be vicious and mean and be sexist and racist . So look , is it naive for people who oppose Trump to go , `` Well , there 's people like you peeling off and other Republicans , so there 's no future for this GOP . '' Is it naive ? Or are there enough younger people who will come in and embrace this white supremacy , racism , sexism , whatever you want to call it , to fuel this party to go forward to win ? I am hopeful that there 's a space in this country , eventually , for a party that is dedicated to individual liberty and constitutional adherence and limited government . But it 's like St. Augustine , `` Lord , make me good , but not yet . '' We 're going to have to burn down this thing first . And the Trump version of the Republican Party has to go . I 'm willing to make sacrifices as a guy who believes in individual liberty in the Constitution . I 'm willing to make sacrifices in the short term and do things that maybe are n't my ideological cup of tea in order to ensure that this country , as an experiment , survives . Because what 's the alternative ? We 're going to slip into an authoritarian nationalism . You know , the reason he 's able to activate some of this , Dean , is that there is a set of human cognitive behaviors that likes having someone say , `` Your fear is OK . Your hate is OK . Your anxiety about brown people coming from Mexico is OK . '' And it 's not OK , but it 's there and he 's a master of demagoguery . He 's a master at propaganda . And so a few of us with , like , the Liam Neeson special set of skills -- there may not be many of us , but we 're pretty good in a scrap . Let 's focus now on the thesis of your book , which is defeating Donald Trump . Let 's take everyone through a few of the themes . One is make this election a referendum on Donald Trump . Explain how you do that . First off , every re-election is a referendum on the incumbent . You 're asking a simple question , `` Do you want this guy , who does these things , for four more years ? '' When Barack Obama was the incumbent , we had a high hill to climb because most people were pretty content with Barack Obama . In 2004 , most people felt pretty safe , relatively speaking , with George W. Bush . That 's why they made those election decisions . Bill Clinton , same story . My old boss , George Bush 41 , you know what ? He did great ending the Cold War . He did great getting Saddam out of Kuwait . On the economy , not so much . And people made a decision , we want a different thing . So all presidential re-elections are a referendum on the incumbent . People have a great opportunity here . You can choose cruelty and corruption or you can choose something else . And something else , it almost does n't matter what the alternative is , as long as it 's not another flavor of evil . If the Democrats do n't make it a referendum on Trump , they will try to make it a referendum on policy . And policy in the hands of the Republicans ... I helped build this machine . I helped do this a long time . Lord , give me a Democratic policy briefing book because I will make a hundred ads out of it . They will be demagogic . They will be terrifying . They will be lies piled upon lies . But the fundamental thing is that they will scare the crap out of the voters I want to scare the crap out of . When you give a 600-page policy document , like Elizabeth Warren did , on her health care plan , whatever its merits , I will find one of my research nerds , who will go through that book line by line , because I 'll never read it . They 'll find three or four things so I can go out and say , `` Union members , your health care will be taken away from you under Elizabeth Warren 's plan . '' Policy is deadly . Policy is a fallacy . Like the Green New Deal . I remember how that went through . Planes are gone , cows will be slaughtered . Right , you ca n't fly on airplanes . You ca n't eat meat . When we look back at 2016 , so many people said , `` Well , the campaign about Hillary was anti-Trump , anti-Trump , without an affirmative message . '' And that 's unfair . But that 's a summary for certain people . In a re-election campaign though , that 's not a bad strategy , you 're saying ? Right , because it is a referendum . There is a four-year baseline now -- you know how Trump behaves . And I will also argue that Hillary Clinton did n't particularly run an effective countervailing campaign to Trump . She played defense constantly in that campaign . In part , because the Republicans had her pinned down in a quasi-impeachment scenario with Benghazi for the first half of her campaign . And then Bernie kind of bled her through the summer . James Comey after that . You make a great point in your book about getting the Democratic base out . I 'm not going to curse , but you write , `` Democrats f**king hate Trump . '' Yeah . I 'm sure Republicans hated Hillary and Obama . You 're a Republican , so I do n't know if you 'll deny this , but hate is part of the currency the GOP used to animate their base . Sure . I 'm seeing hate among Democrats for Trump -- and not even Democrats , women who are not active in politics . Even centrist Republicans in Massachusetts who liked Romney , hate Trump . They will crawl over broken glass to vote against this guy . This is why ideological perfection is the enemy of victory in this . You might not get every single thing you want , but my gosh , if you 've got a group of Democrats , right , who say , `` We wo n't turn our people out unless you 're going to do X or Y for us . '' Or , `` We wo n't turn our people out unless you name our person as the nominee . '' They 're not really your people . Democrats have proven to us in '18 and in the off-year elections , they will come out and vote against this guy and his enablers in droves . They will come out with passion . That 's the easy part . This election has a built in turnout mechanism that 's Donald Trump . As we 're talking , there 's a debate about to happen in Iowa , the last before the Iowa caucus on Feb. 3 . If you were advising Democrats as a group , what would you tell them their message should be tonight in trying to not just win the primary , but defeat Donald Trump ? That 's the key message . You 've got to tell Democratic voters , as the nominee , `` I am the best person to defeat Trump . I can go toe-to-toe with Trump . I can be on the debate stage , I can look him in the eye , I can punch him in the mouth . I will take this motherf ** ker down . '' That 's what Democratic voters are looking for . They want to see some fight in the dog , as they say down South . They want to see somebody who is going to be a scrapper , a fighter , somebody who is passionate and who can articulate the case against Donald Trump and his corruption and his cruelty and his insanity and his unsuitability for this office and the way he demeans this country around the world and at home . They want to see somebody who can do that . Somebody who is absolutely going to be the fighter against Trump . They 're not sitting there going , `` Well , I looked at page 611 of the health care plan for Biden . And then Elizabeth Warren 's on 435 . '' They 're not scoring on policy . They 're looking for the fighter . Performance matters and debates matter . Hillary Clinton was a very smart , considered , professional sort of politician . She got on stage with Trump and he did this whole monkey act , walked around behind her , mugged , made faces and leaned over her . She did n't understand how to handle that . So you want to see somebody with the physical presence too , who feels like they 're going to have an ability to post up against this guy on that debate stage . Because that 's going to be the big show . That 's the reality TV final contest . So should the Democrats , instead of fighting over the nuances of Medicare for All , be slamming Trump on , say , his lie where he said `` I 'm the one that saved coverage for preexisting health conditions . '' In unison going , `` Democrats gave you that . We 're the ones saving it and you want to get rid of it with legislation . John McCain saved it . Now you 're in the courts trying to get rid of it . '' There is no bigger gaslighting on the domestic side that I think I 've seen from Trump . I mean , you can make the case that the economy has been juiced along by tax cuts and by wild deficit spending and that the economy is strong . You can make that case . And you could pick it apart a little bit too , but you can not make a case that Trump did not enthusiastically embrace the bill that came out of the House in 2017 . And they led with the dumbest political move of all time , which is to eliminate pre-existing conditions . Because I have polled this matter extensively , since 2009 . I 've done dozens of focus groups about this . Voters , Republican , Democrat , black , white , liberal , conservative , Catholic , Jewish , every single voter group in this country hates the fact that pre-existing condition coverage could be taken away . They are terrified of it . Leading with Donald Trump , being somebody who says he 's going to stand for you and then screws you over , that iterates across the trade war with farmers in Iowa and Wisconsin and Michigan . That iterates across steelworkers in Ohio and Pennsylvania , coal miners who he promised all these new jobs to . This guy is a lying liar who lies , and they need to call it out . Remember he promised , `` Oh we 're going to have a great new health care plan . It 's going to cover everybody . It 's going to be free . And there 'll be all the pre-existing coverage . '' There 's never been any such thing proposed . So the fact that he lies like a cheap rug iterates across all these different areas and it iterates across the corruption that voters believe he represents . So , it 's a good opportunity . And that 's a way to say it : `` I 'm going to go up on the debate stage against Donald Trump and I 'm going to tear his hide off on the following big lies . '' And pre-existing should be one of them . It obviously troubles Trump because Bloomberg 's ads are focused on that . That 's the thing that inspired the tweet yesterday , `` I saved pre-existing conditions . '' Not only did n't they save them , but after their vote , they put all the Republicans in a bus and took them to the Rose Garden to have a party to celebrate the end of pre-existing medical conditions . And they 've also been litigating it . The Department of Justice , with all the power of the Department of Justice , is litigating to eliminate pre-existing conditions . In the book you also talk about another key issue , the economy . Democrats are almost silent . Now , you 've got Bernie Sanders and Liz Warren talking about how it can be better . I thought one of the big rules in politics is that you go after your opponent 's strength and that 's his strength is the economy . Should they be prosecuting that more ? We just had the jobs report last week . It 's the lowest job growth in eight years , we 're sliding . We 're sliding . It 's weakening . There is a recession coming and there 's a bill going to come due . And look , I 'm a free market guy , but I thought the tax bill was an egregious crony capitalist giveaway . I know the lobbyist who wrote the tax bill . I know who they work for . They work for a bunch of guys down on Wall Street for hedge funds and big banks . And they were specifically engineering this thing to juice Wall Street . A lot of these people out there in the country , the only thing they sort of understand is job or no job . And they hear on the news the market 's up , market 's down , and that 's the big signifier . They 're hearing market up . Well the market 's up because the Fed is still juicing money into the system . The market 's up because this tax bill was an enormous benefit , a $ 2 trillion benefit to Wall Street and the hedge fund guys . So , as a free market guy , I 'm like , `` How is this the market at work ? '' This is the president juicing the system . It 's just like the trade stuff . We 're having enormous economic damage on the trade war , which is actually where I think the Democrats have their strongest economic message . Because remember , we 've got a few swing states to fight this battle with . Pennsylvania , Ohio , Wisconsin , Michigan , those are states that have been screwed in the trade war . And it has n't been fixed . There is no deal with China yet . USMCA is not all that and a bag of chips . This thing is a broken set of economic promises and they have an opportunity to fight on that . I would n't try to fight on `` the stock market 's not up as much this or that percentage . '' Voters do n't really do bank shots . They do A to B , not A to Z . If you were advising on the economy to these Democrats , what would you recommend ? First off , I would talk about the stories of real people in the swing states . `` I 'm farmer X , I am a soybean farmer in Iowa . Donald Trump said that this trade war was going to help me . My farm is in foreclosure now . '' And we do have record farm foreclosures in Wisconsin and Iowa right now . `` I 'm a steelworker in Pennsylvania . Donald Trump promised his trade war was going to help me . Instead , our plant is closed . '' There have been no new steel plants built . He promised this . This is the reality . Tell real stories of real people . You talk about people who are still living in a world where household debt is at record levels . Home values are kind of flat right now . People are starting to feel that 2007 , 2008 feeling in the wind , that we still have n't solved the problem of college loan debt . In fact , this administration is making it much more difficult . There is no Bernie magic wand . You 're not going to wash away $ 2 trillion of debt tomorrow . But there are ways to adjust this so that the country has a system that 's more market-driven and less punitive . And that affects middle-class families less . There are a lot of ways to get to this . Real stories from real people . So you 're saying those are better than statistics and numbers , which Democrats love to talk about . Yeah , this is from a long time ago . There 's a classic editorial cartoon from 1984 where Walter Mondale has this blackboard full of statistics and formulas and charts and Ronald Reagan has a smiley face on his blackboard . That 's what voters get . That 's what they understand . You 're not a fan of Bernie Sanders in your book . You like Liz Warren more . What does it matter if it 's Bernie or Joe Biden or Buttigieg ? Well , I think Warren or Biden or Buttigieg are all viable candidates . Bernie Sanders is Donald Trump election insurance . I honestly believe it . Why ? He 's 300 years old . He just had a heart attack . He is every clich\u00e9 ever , in the history of the free shit movement . Republicans will turn Bernie into the worst caricature you 've ever seen . He is the scary old socialist figure of their nightmares . But in this case , it 's not fake . He 's actually that guy . He 's got an unbelievably thick oppo file . They 're salivating over this guy . I still talk to guys in the mafia , in the Republican mafia . They 're working their hardest to make sure Bernie 's the nominee . They want Bernie to be the nominee . Bernie will lose every single state south of the Mason Dixon Line . No questions asked , including Florida , which you ca n't lose Florida . What do you say about the people who were torn between Bernie and Trump in the 2016 primaries . Then when Bernie did n't get nomination , they went to Trump . At first , I did n't understand it , then I talked to them . Trump was talking about jobs , that NAFTA was n't good , that the rich are getting richer , the system is rigged and he was addressing that very issue . There 's a horseshoe of populism . And the left and right tines become very close together a lot of the time . The problem with the Bernie analysis is that when you go out -- and I go through this in the book , this is a secret that the Republicans have kept pretty quiet for a long time . Most Democrats out in the country , outside of the coasts , are not hard , hard progressives . They 're not socialists . They 're not burn-it-all-down guys . Most Democrats out in the country are pretty moderate . We 've studied this for years and years and years . We 've drilled into this thing over and over again . We 've identified male and female Democratic voters in the suburbs who are mostly moderate . They 're not hard progressives . They 're JFK-style Democrats . They 're Bill Clinton-style Democrats . They 're Barack Obama Democrats . As much as Republicans tried to make Barack Obama into this wild-eyed , leftist , socialist , communist sleeper agent . Barack Obama basically ran as a liberal suburban Republican . He was not scary to people and we knew it . That 's when we tried to turn him into this figure . We could never get there . But if you want to go and put Bernie at the top of the ticket ... I 'm getting like five billion tweets already about Bernie , so , why not make my life more of a living hell ? But Bernie is going to be absolutely the perfect foil for Donald Trump : `` I 'm bad , but this guy is Castro from Vermont . '' Even if Joe Biden gets the nomination , Trump 's going to call him a socialist . We know that . But it 's not true . Right , so are you saying there 's more potential traction and resonance with Bernie as a candidate than it would be for Biden because people know Biden ? First off , Bernie is not a Democrat . He 's got a party that he wants to use as a host vector into the nomination . Who loves Bernie ? Young voters love Bernie . Yes , they do . Young voters adore Bernie . You know what young voters do n't do ? They do n't vote . Old people vote . You know who really , really votes ? Very old people . You know who really votes in Florida , the No. 1 key swing state ? Really goddamn old people , like people on respirators vote in Florida . They 're old , old , old . And they vote like a champ . And that is not their demo . They tend to like Warren or Biden a little more . But , look , nobody 's perfect . To quote , Donald Rumsfeld , `` You go to war with the army you have , not the one you want . '' None of these guys are perfect . And there 's no generational superstar in this field . There 's no Barack Obama or Bill Clinton or JFK in this field . There 's such a debate in my head , I can hear it from my fellow progressives who will be saying , `` Well , Bernie 's going to get people out . '' Your argument to win is that you do n't need a Bernie . You do n't need the machine to get people out . They 're going to come out because of Trump on the other side . Right , Trump 's going to get them out for you . So , if it 's Joe Biden , a more centrist , you think it 's not a problem for turnout for Democrats ? I do n't think it 's a problem for turnout . And here 's the thing : Again , if somebody tells you , `` I wo n't turn out versus Donald Trump , because I did n't get who I wanted , '' fuck them . They 're not on your team . They 're in this for their own narrow interest . This is a country over party thing . And a country over ideological preference thing , or at least it should be in my opinion . If you 're in any community that Donald Trump has demonized or enacted policies that discriminated against , this is very personal . This is n't political . It is a referendum on this guy who 's a monster . Last thing , you make a great point to focus on the Electoral College and key swing states . Absolutely . Not national polls . Why is it the key ? Stay away from national polls . They are always an illusion . They will always trick you into stupid political behavior . Focus on the key states . As much as progressives hate the Electoral College -- and we can argue its flaws all day long -- in 2020 , the Electoral College is the only game in town . There 's not going to be some miracle where it 's not the rule book . The winner of the Electoral College is president . Does n't matter how many popular votes you get . We 're talking about maybe 15 states . Realistically , six or seven of those states are going to be competitive , but you want to play a little chess . You can roll up a victory here or there if you offset somewhere else . Those states are the only thing that matters . You 've got to be following the polls in those states . And you 've got to be rigorous in your approach to polling on this . I mean , look , the polls in '16 were not wrong . On a national level they were n't . They were not wrong , OK , but in the swing states , the Clinton people took their foot off the gas because they were watching the national polls . Donald Trump is an idiot and a moron and just a kook of the first order , but he is surrounded by a bunch of guys like me , who are ride-or-die for him . They do n't love him ideologically , but they 're stuck . And they 're very smart . And they 're very determined and they will do anything to win . And they will fight this in the swing states . They 're not going to spend a dollar in Mississippi . They know how Mississippi is going to go . In your book , you outline two scenarios for election night in November . The upbeat one and the horrific downtrodden one where many of us are looking at Canada , Mexico , whatever countries to live in . If you 're giving one piece of advice to people , regardless of left , right , or center who want Nov. 3 to be a happy night and the defeat of Donald Trump , what 's that one piece of advice ? Bust your ass in the swing states . That 's it . You got to go in the swing states . You 've got to spend every dime there . You got to put the boots on the ground there . I do n't care if you have one volunteer in California . We know how California is going to vote . Everybody in California wants to support the nominee . Go to Michigan , go to Wisconsin , go to Pennsylvania , go to Ohio , go to Florida , go to North Carolina , go to Arizona . Get to work on the ground . Voter contact still matters more than almost any other thing . A knock on the door , a phone call , a personal outreach on social media . That matters more than almost anything else you can do . And fighting this battle in those swing states is vital .", "url": "https://www.salon.com/2020/01/16/rick-wilson/", "kws": ["versus^^Donald^^Trump", "hate^^Trump", "Trump", "Rick^^Wilson", "beating^^Trump", "Hillary^^Clinton", "Democrat", "Bernie^^Sanders", "Barack^^Obama^^Democrats", "JFK-style^^Democrats", "Romney", "Democratic^^voters", "countless^^Republicans", "politics", "Bernie^^kind", "George^^W.^^Bush", "Donald^^Rumsfeld", "John^^McCain", "stupid^^political^^behavior", "toxic^^Trump"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Federal": 1.0000100135803223}}}

The Door County , Wisconsin district attorney on Wednesday charged Thomas J. Minar with child enticement , use of a computer to facilitate a sex crime and exposing a child to harmful materials , all felonies that carry a maximum sentence of 68\u00a01/2 years in prison if convicted on all counts and ordered to serve sentences separately , as well as up to $ 210,000 in fines . An officer with the Sturgeon Bay , Wisconsin police department said he was starting an Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force investigation , on Jan. 6 . The officer created a profile on Grindr , which indicated he was a 19-year-old man named Tyler . Grindr is a social media networking app geared toward the LGBTQ community , according to its website . Minar is the college 's first openly gay president . The college announced on Monday that Minar had been fired as president . On Jan. 6 , the detective began chatting with Minar , who identified himself as a 53-year-old man , according to court documents filed Wednesday morning in the Door County Circuit Court . Minar exchanged messages with the undercover officer , who eventually told Minar he was 15 . Minar sent sexually explicit messages , including photos , to the officer throughout the day , and said he had a vacation home in the area , court documents said . Minar made references to pornography and said several times that what the officer was saying was `` hot , '' or `` sexy , '' and mused on what the child 's body and underwear might look like , according to messages between the two that were included in the court documents . Minar also said he thought it was `` hot '' that the boy was 14 years old when he had sex with an older man , court documents said . As the chat progressed , Minar sent multiple photos of himself in his underwear , some of which also showed his face , asked questions about the boy 's body and asked for photos , according to court documents . The officer attempted to move the conversation to text , but Minar told him it would be bad if messages between the two were found on his phone , court documents said . Messages continued to be sexually explicit and Minar described a sexual act he would perform while thinking about the boy , according to court documents . Minar then suggested they meet sometime for coffee , court documents said . The duo arranged a meeting at a fast-food restaurant in the area . `` And we just hang out right , '' Minar said about the arranged meeting , according to the documents . Police arrested Minar at the restaurant . Minar told police he was not looking for `` sexual things , '' and that if the conversations turned sexual , it was part of a fantasy , documents said . He also told police nothing sexual would have occurred and that young gay men need mentors and role models . He said he started the conversations on Grindr because he was curious and bored and he thought chatting with a 15 year old could lead to conversation , friendship and education , according to court documents . Minar said he is normally attracted to young adult men and has never been attracted to children , but he had communicated with minors using the app in the past , court documents said . Brett Reetz , Minar 's defense attorney based in Sturgeon Bay , Wisconsin , declined to comment on the incident or charges . College officials were already in the process of searching for a new president . Minar announced last year he would be resigning his position in June 2020 .

It appeared to me then as it appeared on this passage , an out of place body of water in the desert landscape , planar and mirage inducing . It could have been the heat exhaustion the first time I saw it , but the sea seemed to bend the horizon . We only saw it in the distance at that time , as our Stagecoach route took us up and away into Anza Borrego . This time around though , we 'd pedal straight for it . Josh had sent out a text sometime in early November , proposing a bike pack between Christmas and New Years to explore the Salton Sea . He 'd seen a TransWorld skate magazine article in the early 2000 's that showed an epic empty pool on the shore of the Salton Sea , and told himself , he 'd go there someday to see it with his own eyes . I 'd already blocked that time to return to the desert , following a proper adventure to Death Valley in the same window the year before . I was headed that way for some riding , camping , and laying under that brilliant desert night sky , so joining friends for a new route -LRB- despite seasonal nightly temps hovering around 32 F -RRB- could n't be passed up . I looked at Josh 's proposed route to Slab City against the timeframe , 6 days or so , and could n't resist the temptation of neighboring Joshua Tree . Then John Watson dropped the Palm Canyon Epic into the mix and outgrew a proper route . We 'd ascend into Joshua Tree , a slice of yucca moth pollinated wonder , with the desert floor growing with scraggly , Dr. Seuss inspired plants . Riding through the Mojave Desert down into the Colorado Desert , we 'd pedal through the transition . Due to abnormally high snow and mud in the area , we 'd end up avoiding Berdoo and Pinkham canyons and stay on the road and descend down towards the Salton Sea via the Orocopia Mountains Wilderness . From the vibrant desert ecosystem , we 'd follow along the eastern shore of the Salton Sea , experiencing the semi-forgotten remnants of human activity , quagmire shores , endless washes , and signs of nature ever so slowly reclaiming the area . Then we 'd round it out with a proper road climb up into the San Jacinto Mountains to descend Palm Canyon . The contemporary Salton Sea was an accident of sorts , a by-product of humans trying to tame and channel the wild Colorado River to provide irrigation to the Imperial Valley for what was , at least for a while , an agricultural boon . For context on what kind of power and scale the Colorado River has , I read this in the book `` The Emerald Mile '' by Kevin Fedarko and will never forget it . `` It took the U.S. and France 15 years to remove 200,000,000 cubic yards of earth to make the Panama Canal , which , in a large rain event , the Colorado River is capable of moving the same amount of material in two weeks . '' So the river poured into the Salton Sink instead of the Gulf of Mexico for about 18 months and formed an inland sea 35 miles long and 15 miles wide until engineers damned it up again . The Salton Sea became a major destination for the better part of four decades . Fishing , water skiing , and resort bliss abounded in this oasis . It was a popular destination for both Southern California residents and tourists from all over . The most enthusiastic of the bunch even took up residence around the Salton Sea . Eventually , the tides shifted out of favor for this resort locale as increased salinity , agricultural runoff , pollution , and flooding created an undesirable condition , untenable for most humans and certainly less than ideal to support a thriving tourism economy . We made the drive down from Santa Cruz the day after Christmas and were forced to take 101 all the way to LA with I-5 closed over the grapevine due to snow , a not so subtle indication of what lay in store for us . We woke up at the Best Western in southwest Palm Springs , it was the less ritzy part of town which suited our sensibilities . Confident we 'd be able to park our cars there for the duration of our trip as current and returning guests , we checked to make sure -- no dice . The manager assured us there was one car per room only and they were full , so we parked our cars in the lot outside Palm Springs Cyclery . The notion of leaving our cars parked in a strip mall lot for 5 nights challenged my usual optimism , but we did n't have a better option . The guys at Palm Springs Cyclery were super nice and accommodating . They let Mike keep his cross bike at the shop while we pedaled -LRB- Mike got in a bonus tour from SC to LA before we all met up for our bikepacking trip -RRB- . They looked after Mike 's bike and assured us that the cars would be fine while we were away -- so off we went . As we rode north through town , the steep and dramatic Mt. Jacinto loomed in the background , while fur boots and Starbucks Frappuccinos dawdled in the foreground . We received mixed looks from folks as we rode through , I imagined somewhere on the spectrum of `` wow , look at those adventurers ! '' to `` who are these weirdos ? '' We made it about six miles before a perfect storm of `` the best date shake in the valley '' met a slow leak in my front tire , so we pulled over to try the shake and pump up a tire . Snacking ensued , as did the inevitable futzing of gear every time we stopped as if there is never-ending optimization to achieve . We pedaled on , only to realize Troy was way behind us , so we soft-pedaled to allow him to catch up . Troy pulled up alongside us , visibly exasperated and a little out of breath , and quickly launched into a diatribe saying `` the first rule of bikepacking is to not pedal away while your friend is finishing his ice cream . '' For the rest of the trip , we asked if everyone was done with their ice cream as our universal check-in for pedal readiness . We rode up little Morongo Canyon , riding from pavement to soft sand just packed enough to navigate on 29 x 2.3-2 .4 tire range -LRB- but not the whole time -RRB- . Creosote bushes started filling in , as did glowing Golden Cholla Cactus , before the first Joshua Trees arrived , fuzzy , faceted , and sprawling . A pair of Bighorn Sheep scampered across the road and deftly scaled the rocky and scrubby slope beyond , blending in and moving almost without a sound . The ice hinted at us in the lower elevations , then arrived in full form the higher we went . We topped out around 3,900 ft , passing by a few folks who were doing target practice with a shotgun and snowballs . We managed to watch one round but the shooter missed the snowball . Then they noticed us and we all glanced at each other with relaxed disbelief and exchanged some small talk before Josh used their tailgate to get his leg warmers on . We part skied , surfed , and biked down the icy snow and mud into the town of Joshua Tree , finding warm respite at Joshua Tree Saloon with 150 of our closest friends . We thawed out , filled up on warm food and cold beer before pedaling down the road to camp at sportsman club RV park . We paid $ 20 for a picnic table and had access to water and a bathroom . As the weather can sometimes be best described by the clothes you have on , it was two pairs of socks , long johns , down pants , down jacket , a buff , and beanie kind of night . It was just plain cold . After our shorter than planned first day we adjusted mileage accordingly and pedaled through the heart of Joshua Tree NP . We dove into our first freeze-dried meals of the trip and I opened a package of 2 serving black bean quinoa and poured in its requisite 1 and 3/4 cup of freshly boiled water . When we first started doing these trips a handful of years ago , I had little regard for freeze-dried meals , rehydrated mush of usually bland color and heavy in sodium . For the first time this trip , while packing and reaching up in the cupboard where I stow my ramen , miso soup , Nuun , and bars I pulled down a few freeze-dried meals -- leftovers from our Idaho bike pack in August . I looked at their shiny plastic exterior and smoothed out the package , checking expiration dates , only to feel a rush of joy thinking of all the places I 've been when it 's been a mountain house kind of meal . It 's certainly not world-class cuisine , but I definitely associate them with some of the best experiences I 've had . Yuccas , cholla , and creasote abounded , coated by a winter dusting of snow . The north side of the park proved to be much colder and snowier , and as we pedaled through , we imagined we 'd end up camping in the snow by day 's end . Cresting the central rise in Joshua tree through Wilson Canyon , we descended down from the snow-covered yuccas below the snow line , and witnessed a relatively sudden shift in vegetation , with no more yuccas but an intensely dense `` garden of cholla '' . Where did they all come from ?! We had just ridden through miles of Joshua Trees and then this seemingly invisible line moved us into a new vegetative landscape . Slope , substrate , temperature , aspect , all hiding in plain sight , contributed to this shift . We stopped by the garden to get a closer look and Josh and Jon got a feel even , picking up cholla balls that stuck to their shoes and clothes . Damn , they are sharp ! Feeling more optimistic with no snow on this side of the park , we pedaled into twilight , riding quietly and appreciating the desert night sky with palettes of blues and purples and pinks and oranges . We pulled into Cottonwood campground near the southern exit of JTNP just as the day 's last light dimmed into darkness . In one of Troy 's richer moments , he flatly said while we set up our tents , `` well it 's cold , but at least it 's windy '' , bringing a warming dose of levity in an otherwise rapidly freezing evening . As long as I 've known Troy he 's had his own brand of aphorisms , and we used another one of his on this trip quite a few times , `` never done that before , but I 'll do it again . '' Just as our body heat was warming up our camp clothes and our water was on the verge of boiling , a flashlight and direct voice came to our little picnic table area . `` Excuse me , you are camped here illegally and need to vacate this area immediately '' . Cold and hungry , we first asked if we could at least eat our dinner while quickly thinking on our numb feet how to get out of this situation . Our level headed sage , Jon , quickly chimed in and asserted that we did n't have enough lights to go back on the road and ride anywhere safely , besides the fact that it was already about freezing and we did n't have any other camp options in Joshua Tree . Plus it was dark , and we had already yard sale 'd our gear out . What Jim did n't know is that Light and Motion had equipped us with fresh Vis 360 adventure lights for the trip , so we hypothetically could have ridden into the night for another hour or two , we just had nowhere to pedal and the temperatures were plummeting . Jim came around after some negotiating but told us to be at the visitor center at 9 am to pay for camping and park passes . We rolled out of cottonwood to pay our dues with Jim and ranger , who graciously allowed us to camp at the day-use picnic area since the camp was full . We decided to pass on Pinkham Canyon , reports of mud and snowmaking the passage unrideable at best . We opted for the paved descent out of the park . Crossing I-10 to the south , we made our way toward Chiriaco Summit . The road turned to old buckled and eroded pavement , then to sand , and we made our way south around Orocopia Mountains Wilderness , ultimately descending the phenomenally textured Red Canyon Trail down to Bradshaw Road . Road is a generous term since the road was a desert wash about a half a mile across . We crisscrossed our way , making our best attempts to not ride in the soft sandy fluff created by the side by side off-roaders , which is virtually unrideable without fat bikes . We were fortunate that it had rained the week before , so there were some packed sections we were able to navigate with relative ease . This dynamic kind of riding , when conditions are right , has to be some of the most fun riding you can do -LRB- or at least in my humble opinion -RRB- . Once we descended out of Red Canyon we laid eyes on the Salton Sea for the first time this trip -- hazy and reflective at the same time . Between limited options , needing water , and the allure of hot mineral springs , we splurged for a night of camping at the Fountain of Youth RV Resort , parking our bikes next to a 50-foot rig with a side by side parked next to it . This place has hot tubs , showers , electricity , grocery store , and a cafe so if you 're pinched on a multi-day trip this place functions as a small town . This place is an official wintering ground for Snowbirds , northerners who move to warmer , southern states in winter . It was n't long before an old-timer , a snowbird from Oregon who we came to know as Doc Loomis , paid us a visit . He was intrigued by five guys on mountain bikes rolling into camp . He told us about the trail network he 'd been working on for the last 12 years , and encouraged us to follow the red and green rocks south of here on our way to Slab City . He pedaled along and not even a few minutes later we were paid a visit from Fern Fennel from Salmon Arm , B.C. . She popped down , jolly as could be with a bag of beer , offered a lantern and to charge some electronics in her RV , and let us fire up her grill for some hot dogs . This phenomenon of utter kindness from strangers while bike touring is not new , but it always surprises me and never gets old . She said to look her and her husband up if we are ever up on Shuswap Lake near Salmon Arm , B.C. -- they host touring cyclists on Warm Showers . We awoke on day four and started with a morning soak at the fountain of youth . Roughly 30 senior snowbirds sang `` froggy went a courting '' during their 7am water aerobics . They may come down to winter here and relax , but water aerobics is a big part of the program . Then we loaded up on breakfast at the cafe\u0301 with omelets , breakfast sandos , and I grabbed an extra breakfast burrito to go -- knowing I 'd be hungry within an hour . The metabolism while bikepacking seems to grow exponentially with each passing day . We left Fountain of Youth and rode a couple miles of Doc 's trails south until we landed on Canal Road , and save for a moto and a side by side , we had 16 miles of undulating gravel and sand to ourselves . Then we landed at the entrance of East Jesus . The resident host , Moon , enthusiastically told the story of their founder Charlie Russell and his vision for a world without garbage , and how today , was another beautiful day on spaceship earth . Moon originally came out to East Jesus to make a BBC documentary and then never left . We were lauded for arriving on fossil-free vehicles . East Jesus has beautiful and bizarre art made out of garbage , as it tries to shine a light on consumption and humans ' take of natural resources . It possessed a harrowing beauty to walk around and a good reminder of all the stuff humans manufacture , consume and dispose of . Humans create an incomprehensible amount of waste , and East Jesus has demonstrated this viscerally . We rolled out of East Jesus and through Slab City , which by any measure is more or less a large RV park with all types of permanent and semi-permanent structures . It 's an old WWII marine training ground , Fort Dunlap , with only the concrete slabs remaining -- hence the name Slab City . All of the folks residing there are technically squatting , in an interesting case of lawless and uncontrolled territory owned by the State of California . The main tourist draw here is Salvation Mountain , which is a massive , colorful , adobe creation paying tribute to g_d . It was built over a few decades and is now overseen by a 501c3 non-profit and stewarded by , ostensibly , a group of locals . The creator , Leonard Knight , wanted to share his message of love and light and used adobe , hay , cement , sand , and an estimated 100,000 plus gallons of paint to create this man-made mountain . As we exited Slab City , a brightly painted outpost reminded us `` Caution , reality ahead '' . The reality , of course , is relative . As we pedaled out of Slab City toward Bombay Beach , the reality we entered still felt pretty out there . Miles of wash and long trains with tagged rail cars stretched on to our right , with miles of soupy substrate and the Salton Sea to our left . Our target destination was the Ski Inn for some beer and onion rings . As we walked in , our eyes caught a sea of dollar bills , thousands , taped all over the place . The beer is good and the people are kind , but finding a place to put your dollar bill will give you a run for your money . We meandered out to the beach for sunset to see the purple orange hues illuminate the chalky white , fishbone riddled shore . Turns out as we were leaving East Jesus a few hours before , this couple decided to take a back scenes tour with the host , the tour we turned down to keep our journey moving . This couple was Ben and Rachel from LA , van-lifers and coffee connoisseurs and artists , and we ended up stumbling upon each other at last light . They had an espresso maker and made us all shots while we indulged in simple humanity with strangers in the dwindling light of the Salton Sea . We grabbed some quick snacks at the one market in Bombay Beach and then rode 15 paved highway miles in the cold dark all the way to Salton Sea State Park headquarters camp . What we 'll put ourselves through for a picnic table and water ... We awoke on day 5 and spent some morning down by the water , with hundreds of Bonaparte 's Gulls and a few beautiful American Avocets . We rode back the flat and windy miles from the semi-forgotten Salton Sea into expansive golf communities , complete with Porsches , bike lane/golf cart lanes , and green manicured lawns . Flat sprawl landed us at a strip mall with a Ralph 's and an unassuming cocina , Tu Madres , for lunch . If you 're in the area , their Baja burrito is top-notch and their Palomas will quench your thirst . The day we arrived they had been open for two weeks . To make sure we fully appreciated our all pavement day , we polished off the days ride with a 4000 ft road climb up to pinyon flat campground for our final camp of the trip . We 'd ride the palm canyon epic for breakfast for the last meal of an epic feast of a ride . As far as riding Palm Canyon , I 'd check out John 's write up from a group ride they did that provides a zoom in on that section of this course . In total , this course covered 276 miles -LRB- ~ 100 miles of dirt -RRB- and climbed 15k ft , six days made for a comfortable and achievable itinerary even with the shortest days of the year -LRB- as long riding in cold darkness is n't off the table -RRB- . Snow , sand , mud , gravel , and pavement were all encountered and if attempting this same route , a minimum of 6 liters of water capacity in the colder months worked well , minimum tire size of 2.3-2 .4 to be relatively efficient across the terrain , and good sense of humor when it 's 30 F out and your feet are numb .", "url": "https://theradavist.com/2020/01/sand-and-snow-bikepacking-to-the-salton-sea-from-palm-springs-and-then-some/", "kws": ["Salton^^Sea", "Palm^^Canyon", "desert", "Orocopia^^Mountains^^Wilderness", "southwest^^Palm^^Springs", "soft^^sand", "Snow", "mountain^^bikes", "flat^^campground", "water^^skiing", "Palm^^Springs^^Cyclery", "sunset", "Cottonwood^^campground", "dirt", "Colorado^^River", "camping", "Youth^^RV^^Resort", "bike", "Wilson^^Canyon", "winter"], "text_category": {}}

The first Dolittle reviews are in , and there 's a lot to go through . The CGI , action sequences , all-star voice cast -- including Rami Malek and Tom Holland -- and Robert Downey Jr. 's Welsh accent are all in the sights of Dolittle reviewers . We 've rounded up some of the best -LRB- and most brutal -RRB- down below . 0/4 -- Washington Post -- Kristen Page-Kirby Ultimately Dolittle is not just a weak story , badly told , but a puzzling waste of talent . -LRB- The only silver lining ? A relatively fleet running time . -RRB- No rating -- Variety -- Courtney Howard Despite the good the picture attempts to put into the universe , there 's much more that drags it down . The sheer volume of crass flatulence jokes and routines involving animal nether regions should get youngsters in the audience laughing , but will just as assuredly make the grownups groan . Once the film wears out jokes with dog Jip -LRB- voiced by Tom Holland -RRB- , discussing butts and scooting on the floor , you 'd think the film would 've reached its capacity . But no , there 's still more in store , as the film stoops to include a disgruntled tiger -LRB- Ralph Fiennes -RRB- getting kicked in the crotch and a dragon -LRB- Frances de la Tour -RRB- getting an enema . 2/5 -- The Guardian -- Benjamin Lee There are moments when Dolittle threatens to become something more willfully perverse or at least distinguishable -- Marion Cotillard 's revolutionary fox suggesting she should kill a child with the help of Selena Gomez 's friendly giraffe , a stick insect spying on Jim Broadbent , Downey giving Frances de la Tour 's short-tempered dragon a colonoscopy -- but they 're regrettably fleeting and we 're soon back on the forgettably straight and narrow . It 's ultimately a miracle that despite the tortured production process , Dolittle can most generously be described as passable for young , undiscerning viewers . It wo n't charm or amuse you particularly but it 's not a catastrophe , the highest praise I can muster . No rating -- Vulture -- Bilge Ebiri The problems are manifold , but let 's start with the most tragic one : Downey , a delightfully inventive , generational talent who has been borged into the Marvel machine for the past decade-plus , seems determined to sabotage this movie . His rapid-fire delivery , his self-aware energy , his ability to win over an audience , should have been ideally suited for this character , but he undoes any potential goodwill by opting for an ill-advised and half-hearted Welsh accent which occasionally -LRB- and I 'm assuming inadvertently -RRB- slips into Irish , Indian , and Jamaican intonations . C - -- AV Club - Katie Rife That 's typical of the film 's humor , which reeks of after-the-fact punch-up prompted by negative test-audience feedback . That is to say , Dolittle is full of anachronistic pop culture references and poop and fart humor , jokes delivered in suspiciously low-impact style by the film 's animated animals . Occasionally , a bit pops up that 's specific to a particular species , like the scene where Dolittle escapes the jaws of a man-eating tiger by waving a mirror like a laser pointer . These are actually lightly amusing , as is Michael Sheen 's over-the-top performance as Dolittle 's sworn rival , the sputtering incarnation of medical mediocrity Dr. Blair M\u00fcdfly GamesRadar + 's Entertainment Writer .

'' That 's the question Homeland showrunner Alex Gansa annually posed to Washington insiders before putting fingers to keyboard on a season of his Emmy-winning Showtime drama . What began as a slick spy thriller driven by a potent sexual chemistry , courtesy of leads Claire Danes and Damian Lewis , evolved into an expos\u00e9 on the greatest dangers to an America that finally had some distance from 9/11 . Threats from ISIS , the surveillance state and Russian interference punctuated clandestine meetings with the intelligence community -- part of a yearly writers and cast symposium in D.C. affectionately dubbed `` Spy Camp . '' The series , loosely developed from an Israeli format by Gansa and longtime collaborator Howard Gordon -LRB- 24 -RRB- , became an instant and bona fide success when it premiered in 2011 to 2.8 million viewers and unanimous critical acclaim . Boasting a murderers ' row of writers , each a showrunner at one time , the drama catapulted Showtime and studio Fox 21 to an echelon of prestige TV they previously could n't reach . It swept its first Emmys -LRB- with six awards total -RRB- and those first seasons had both the Obamas and Clintons soliciting screeners . In Hollywood , efforts to capitalize on its early success were dubbed `` the Homeland effect . '' And despite years of would-be copycats following suit on broadcast and cable , few captured even a sliver of zeitgeist or lasted more than a single season . Indeed , Homeland briefly seized the industry 's and viewers ' attention in a way that only Game of Thrones has since -- a feat that now seems virtually impossible in an era with nearly 500 scripted U.S. series airing each year . As the drama is set to premiere its eighth and final season Feb. 9 , Gansa , Gordon , Danes and those closest to the series look back on the show 's legacy and reveal previously untold stories behind their landmark hit -- including the battles to hire -LRB- then let go of -RRB- Lewis , a secret call with Edward Snowden , how the 2015 Paris attacks forced everyone to reassess the series ' portrayal of the Muslim world and why the last batch of episodes , where Danes ' character is now suspected of being a double agent , echoes the first . PART I : Former writing partners Alex Gansa and Howard Gordon , reunited on the last seasons of Fox 's 24 , option an Israeli format about two freed prisoners of war and recast it as an exploration of America 's place in the world a decade after 9/11 . ALEX GANSA -LRB- CO-CREATOR , SHOWRUNNER -RRB- This was unfinished business . Howard and I had always wanted to do our own show . HOWARD GORDON -LRB- CO-CREATOR -RRB- We split up as writing partners in our 20s , during the first season of The X-Files . We stayed friends , but we just were n't seeing a lot of each other . GANSA And 15 years later , I was on a train on my way out of the business . Howard rescued me from literal poverty and let me come on 24 for the last two years . GORDON In the middle of the last season , -LSB- agent -RSB- Rick Rosen , who represents -LSB- Israeli studio -RSB- Keshet , came back from a trip to Israel , calls me and says , `` I have your next show . '' RICK ROSEN -LRB- AGENT -RRB- I 'd gone to lunch with Avi Nir , the chairman of Keshet , and he says to me , `` This writer , Gideon Raff , pitched me this show called Hatufim '' -- which translates to Prisoners of War . He asked , `` Do you think that type of show would work in the States ? '' I said , `` Absolutely , and I have the writer . '' GORDON It had n't been shot . It had only been written , so we had 10 episodes translated to English . -LSB- 20th Century -RSB- Fox agreed to buy the underlying property , so we could adapt it . In Hatufim , there was no Carrie , no Saul . It was really about two soldiers . DANA WALDEN -LRB- THEN-CHAIRMAN OF 20TH CENTURY FOX TV -RRB- Alex and Howard became taken with this idea of what happens if a prisoner of war has turned . GANSA We completely devoted ourselves to writing the pilot for six months . But this was almost 10 years after 9/11 , so there was a fear among everybody -- the studio , the writers , the agencies -- that no one would be interested in this story . And Dana did n't want another 24 . GORDON But she really wanted it to go to Fox . ROSEN Kevin -LSB- Reilly -RSB- , who was running Fox at the time , walks in with the script in his hand and just tosses it on the conference table and goes , `` I have no notes . It 's kind of perfect . However , if you 're going to do this here , you really need to pump up the volume on this show . '' And the guys basically said , `` We did that show , and we 're not doing that show again . '' WALDEN We had imagined a smooth path onto the air at -LSB- Fox -RSB- , so Kevin passing was a bit of a setback . But there were so many choices for viewers , even then , that asking audiences to make a weekly serialized commitment on broadcast was getting harder and harder . NBC passed for similar reasons . GORDON And then FX passed . They thought Damages had been problematic because it was a serialized , but David Nevins had just started at Showtime . DAVID NEVINS -LRB- THEN-EXEC VP ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING AT SHOWTIME -RRB- The first couple days on the job , Rick slipped the script to me . ROSEN That was on a Friday . On Saturday , David is on the phone saying to me , `` If you give me this show , I 'll order it to pilot right now . '' I said , `` How can you do that ? Have you already spoken to Les -LSB- Moonves -RSB- ? '' He said , `` I have Les ' backing . I 'm ordering it . '' BERT SALKE -LRB- PRESIDENT , FOX 21 TELEVISION STUDIOS -RRB- David was really aggressive and went for it in a way I do n't think anyone had ever seen him do before . GARY LEVINE -LRB- THEN-PRESIDENT OF ENTERTAINMENT AT SHOWTIME -RRB- He was rabid for it . NEVINS I had to sell Dana and -LSB- then-partner -RSB- Gary -LSB- Newman -RSB- , so my pitch from the beginning was we 'd get it on the air for the 10th anniversary of 9/11 , and Dexter , our No. 1 show at the time , would be its lead-in . But I had one big note : Carrie Mathison felt too Jack Bauer . We discussed how we were going to make her a more complicated , less reliable character . GANSA Carrie was n't bipolar in that draft . NEVINS It 's not that I did n't want to make her reliable to the audience . I wanted to make her less reliable to the authorities . LEVINE Our job was to make it belong on premium cable . Having just come off of 24 , their spec -- which was great -- had a lot of plot twists . We needed the character turns to be as surprising as the plot . GANSA They did an amazing job pushing us to make this character more vivid , but they were also attached to their model of casting movie stars who were on the tail end of their career . NEVINS It 'd be impolitic to mention names . GANSA They were pushing for Robin Wright or Halle Berry or Maria Bello , who were all already in their 40s . SALKE Halle Berry was the big deal , and a lot of that was being driven by the network . GANSA By the time you 're in your mid-40s and you 've got bipolar illness for that long , everything is calcified . ROSEN I 'd been looking for a project for Claire Danes in television for a while . CLAIRE DANES -LRB- CARRIE MATHISON -RRB- I had just done -LSB- HBO 's Emmy-winning miniseries -RSB- Temple Grandin , and I felt charged up to do something similarly thrilling and scary . There just was n't much available . NEVINS You did n't want to stop and think too much about the math of how old she was on 9/11 -LSB- 22 -RSB- , but you also do n't question the range of Claire Danes , so that was not a hard call . GORDON And we had called the character Claire in the first 16 drafts . DANES I still do n't quite know how to take that . GANSA Sunday in the Park With George in the '80s with Bernadette Peters and Mandy Patinkin , and it changed my life . But Mandy had such a sterling reputation ... LEVINE Mandy had balked at every other show he 's ever been on . If he had a long-term contract , he would get antsy and bail -- including on one of ours , Dead Like Me . MANDY PATINKIN -LRB- SAUL BERENSON -RRB- I thought they were all crazy to hire me , given my track record . I never thought I 'd work in television again after my last experience -LSB- on Criminal Minds -RSB- . -LSB- Disturbed by the CBS show 's content , he went AWOL after its second season . -RSB- SALKE He 's a beautiful soul . But , yes , I personally got a number of very firm calls asking , `` Do you know what you 're getting into ? '' LEVINE We wanted him in the role , so we decided not to offer him a long-term contract , just a two-year deal in hopes that he would love it enough to keep re-upping . PATINKIN They offered me a one-year contract . It 's the only way I 'd do it . But from day one , I 'd never been happier on a film or television job -- except maybe The Princess Bride . DANES When Mandy and I did the read-through for the pilot , the chemistry was so strong , so immediate , I was really startled by it . He also bears an uncanny resemblance to my best friend 's dad . GANSA There was the Claire battle , the Mandy battle and then the Damian Lewis battle . There was tremendous resistance to casting him as Brody . SALKE Alex initially pushed for Damian , but people did n't see it . Life , on NBC , had just finished . It was n't everyone 's favorite show . DAMIAN LEWIS -LRB- NICHOLAS BRODY -RRB- Life was terrific , but it was kiboshed by the writers strike . After that , I was told I looked like a guy who 'd led a show that only lasted two seasons . DANES They were thinking of somebody else who I did n't think was right for it . GANSA Ryan Phillippe came up . Also Kyle Chandler ... GORDON Then I flew to New York on a red-eye to meet Alessandro Nivola -LSB- A Most Violent Year -RSB- , who famously said no to everything . He turned down Dexter . GANSA Howard failed that mission -LSB- with Nivola -RSB- , so we were three weeks away from shooting the pilot , and we did not have a Brody yet -- and we 're still in the `` Damian Lewis will never play this role , please do not bring him up ever again '' phase . NEVINS I did n't really know Damian . GANSA Then I remembered -LSB- pilot director -RSB- Michael Cuesta had told me to watch this movie Damian did called Keane . LEWIS About five people saw it , but it was the best reviewed movie I 've ever been in . GORDON Alex called me at 10:30 that night and told me I had to watch it . I was blown away . GANSA The next morning we sent it to all the people who said , `` This guy is a dead issue , '' and , to their credit , they watched it and said , `` This is the guy . '' Also , we had nobody else ... MICHAEL CUESTA -LRB- DIRECTOR-PRODUCER -RRB- I came on board to direct the pilot when Ben Affleck fell out . The shoot in Charlotte went smoothly , but for the part in Israel I 'd scouted Barta'a on the West Bank for this big traffic jam -LSB- scene -RSB- . We closed the street and apparently paid off merchants on the wrong side of the street . Fights broke out . People picked up rocks . We got the hell out . GANSA You start a pilot not knowing whether you have a show or not . But on the second or third day , it 's freezing cold and I 'm watching Claire and Mandy in their very first scene together on the monitor -- wondering if we 're going to believe this mentor/protege relationship or even buy them as CIA officers . Within the first 20 seconds , I knew we had a show . CUESTA Then Osama bin Laden was killed , and it was clear we were getting a series pickup . PART II : Homeland marks Showtime 's most watched premiere in nearly a decade with 2.8 million viewers . A hit in Hollywood and Washington , it 's suddenly the most talked-about show in America , but the battle over what to do with Lewis ' character casts a pall over the second and third seasons . NEVINS It was a very well-made pilot , but I did n't have much expectation other than knowing the show was good . MEREDITH STIEHM -LRB- WRITER -RRB- They did not have a female writer , so I came on after the fourth episode . It was just Alex , Howard , Chip Johannessen -LSB- Dexter -RSB- , Henry Bromell -LSB- Brotherhood -RSB- , Alex Cary -LSB- Lie to Me -RSB- and me that first season . SALKE Each of them had been showrunners . It began the trend of all-star writing staffs . STIEHM Some people called it a murderers ' row , but I thought we were more of a really cool band that lasted two years . GANSA After the reviews , we took over the entertainment world for a time . Steven Spielberg would call for DVDs . WALDEN People in the highest levels of government , of entertainment , of business in general , were calling . Within a two-week period , the Obama administration and Secretary Clinton 's office called for early cuts of Homeland . The number of times in my career that has happened would be exactly one . DANES Three episodes in , people were literally running out of stores , charging me with enthusiasm . I 'd never experienced that before . My So-Called Life had this amazingly rich afterlife , but there was n't that appreciation as it was airing . GANSA Damian went to the White House . LEWIS Donald Trump and others on the right were peddling this idea that Obama was born in Kenya , so I had this season-one DVD and , tongue in cheek , I wrote him a note . GANSA It read , `` From one Muslim to another . '' LEWIS It was a very British thing to do , but it festered . Two weeks later , I emailed -LSB- White House Press Secretary -RSB- Jay Carney , `` Please tell me that the president got my joke ! '' Jay said , `` Yeah , he got it . Everything 's cool . '' ROSEN I was at some ridiculous dinner where Obama goes from table to table , and his aide is whispering in his ear who everyone is . When he gets to me , Obama looks at me and goes , `` You 're involved in Homeland ? On Saturdays , Michelle goes to play tennis with the girls and I tell her I 'm going down to the office to work . What I 'm really doing is watching Homeland DVDs . '' LEVINE A meeting was arranged between the cast , the network and the CIA at Langley . They confiscated our cellphones , and our whole team is just sitting there across from maybe 50 CIA agents . NEVINS John Brennan , who was running the CIA at the time , came out in the middle and says , `` I do n't know what your show is , but I know it matters to my people . '' LEVINE Then he grabbed Mandy and said , `` Hey , do you want to see your office ? '' GANSA They talked about how similar our professions were -- it 's a lot of acting , storytelling and feigned intimacy . DANES There were parodies on Saturday Night Live and in MAD magazine . That 's a real sign that you 've made it , getting roasted . There was a porn made about us . NEVINS One of the most memorable experiences coming out of the show was that first Emmy night . WALDEN I was so overwhelmed that night . I just kept hearing them name the show . GANSA It was very funny seeing those guys -LSB- John Landgraf and Kevin Reilly -RSB- at the Emmys that year . They just looked at me and shook their heads . SALKE Everybody bemoans turning down Homeland -- no one more than Kevin Reilly . ROSEN My dear friends at HBO were not entirely pleased with me , to put it very mildly , that they did n't get a shot . PATINKIN I had never seen anything like that first season . But nothing is ever like the first time . It 's never that good again . The art of living is trying to keep it good enough . NEVINS Brody was intended to be just a few episodes -- but , from the very first script , I said no . We started tinkering with the relationship . GANSA It was so clear after the first season that there was still story to tell . And the relationship between the two of them in the most unexpected way had become front and center . SALKE You did n't know if you 're watching for Brody or Carrie , but you were definitely watching for both of them . It was so fucking compelling . GORDON Chemistry , whatever that is , they had it . LEWIS My understanding was always two years . Halfway through season two , having not explicitly said they were killing Brody , they gave Nevins the breakdown : `` And this is when Brody dies . '' Nevins was like , `` No , no , no . Brody 's not dying . '' GANSA I do n't know that they were having conversations . They were just on their knees , begging not to get rid of Damian . WALDEN They contemplated every conceivable scenario of what happens to the show with him , what happens to the show without him . CHIP JOHANNESSEN -LRB- WRITER -RRB- At that point , -LSB- keeping him -RSB- was not a decision we made . It was a decision that was made for us and we adapted to it . LEWIS When the critics started saying the show lost its port , I think it 's because the guys had to reimagine and rewrite it just to keep me going . NEVINS We got hammered on things that we did n't deserve to be hammered on . GANSA By season three , the story was running out of steam . PATINKIN I think they kept the Brody story going a year too long . LEWIS I was n't in every episode that last season , and that confused people . Brody was a problem . You could n't keep flip-flopping . `` Are they going to kill each other or fuck each other ? '' was interesting for a while . DANES We always knew that that was a finite relationship . GORDON But we 'd baked him into the fabric of the thing . WALDEN Finally losing Brody , that conversation made me a little sick to my stomach . GANSA There would have been something braver about ending his story sooner . But season three proved so difficult on so many fronts . Henry Bromell died -LSB- of a heart attack in 2013 -RSB- , and we were getting rid of Damian even though he and Claire had the most incredible thing . DANES Alex is actually a really good surfer , which is kind of the best metaphor for television . You 're riding this wave , and you do n't really know where it 's going to take you exactly . GANSA The praise and the criticism are both overstated . We should n't have gotten that much praise in the beginning . And where we got criticism , from people who did n't want to watch the show after Brody died or from whatever backlash we had when Quinn -LSB- Rupert Friend -RSB- died , it 's because people start becoming proprietary about the characters once you 've been on the air long enough . RUPERT FRIEND -LRB- PETER QUINN -RRB- If I remember right , he 'd been gassed and in a coma . Alex said , `` Well , this has been great , thanks a lot . Bye . '' Then , a year later , I got an equally matter-of-fact , `` Actually , you 're not dead . '' Then he really died . JOHANNESSEN It took me a while to warm up to Rupert ... GANSA There was a lot happening behind the scenes that I 'm not at liberty to share . JOHANNESSEN But by the time he is apparently dead at the end of season five , we all adored him . Bringing him back -LSB- briefly -RSB- in season six was driven by some unfinished stuff between Quinn and Carrie . SALKE There are viewers , especially women , who liked Quinn more than Brody . FRIEND Lesli Linka Glatter -LSB- director/producer -RSB- once told me he 's kind of a perfect man -- to which I said , `` Lesli , he kills people for money . '' DANES A lot of people died on this show , especially if they ever made out with Carrie Mathison . PART III : Without Lewis , Homeland re-centers on Danes ' erratic case officer and moves production abroad to Berlin and Cape Town -LRB- subbing for Pakistan -RRB- , as the series becomes more informed by meetings with A-list intelligence experts . GANSA We were always very interested in what was being said and discussed in the halls of power in Washington , not just at the CIA but the White House , the State Department and in the Washington Post press room . That began to inform us more after season three . Without Brody , we had to pick an idea to talk about over a season . That 's when Spy Camp became really important . STIEHM The writers would meet in January , knowing we had to shoot by June , but we never knew what the story was going to be . D.C. was really a fishing expedition . JOHN MCGAFFIN -LRB- FORMER CIA OFFICER -RRB- Henry Bromell , my cousin , had started calling me and asking , `` John , what would happen if ... ? '' After Henry died , Alex called and asked if I 'd still be willing to help out . GORDON We 'd already been turned down by the military , which was so cooperative on 24 . They wanted nothing to do with a show about a soldier who came home a terrorist . We found that out when Michael Klick , one of our producers , needed some sort of helicopter or something -- and they were like , `` No fucking way . '' MCGAFFIN The show was greatly popular with intelligence officials , and they became increasingly eager to help us . So I made arrangements with the City Tavern Club , one of the oldest private clubs in Georgetown that a lot of former CIA people frequent , that we would take over the top floor for a week . GANSA The day would start at 8 a.m. , and it would often end after 10 p.m. . It was this old place with rickety chairs and the same food all the time . GORDON Oh God , it 's so disgusting ... soggy . But the level of people you would not believe -- and they 'd come for two hours , two intense hours . MCGAFFIN Former CIA people , ambassadors , ex-military , journalists , intelligence officers of all kinds would sit down with the writers , Lesli , Alex , Howard , Mandy and Claire . And every source who came in , I told them they were there to answer this question : `` What are the national security issues likely to bite the security establishment in the ass over the coming year ? '' GANSA The first thing we got was a litany of everything we got wrong : `` We do n't talk on our cellphones . We do n't operate on American soil . Carrie would have to take blood tests , so the medication would come up . '' But we got the spirit right , and that 's what they appreciated . PATINKIN Every year , every individual echoed the same concerns , and it really started setting the tone for each season . DANES It was an avalanche of unsettling information . LESLI LINKA GLATTER -LRB- DIRECTOR/PRODUCER -RRB- We had Gen. Michael Hayden , the guy in the Iraq War doing rendition , black sites and enhanced torture techniques -- so , to me , he was the devil -- booked back-to-back with Dana Priest , who won the Pulitzer Prize for writing the book that exposed rendition , black sites and enhanced torture techniques . GANSA We had to figure out a way to usher Hayden down one set of stairs and Priest up another set of stairs because you did n't want them to run into each other . There was so much hostility . MCGAFFIN We arranged a Skype call once with two senior Mossad officers in Tel Aviv and had a long discussion about spy work with Iranians . GLATTER And any time we had a new actor who played a spy , Alex and I talked to them about what it means to be a spy . We had this one guy , and we 're going on and on , and he interrupts and says , `` I 'm so sorry , I really need to stop you . I was in Mossad . '' GANSA Bart Gellman , this Pulitzer Prize winner who wrote the Cheney book -LSB- Angler : The Cheney Vice Presidency -RSB- , told me he was going to bring a guest . He shows up with his laptop , sets it up , dials a number or whatever , and the next thing we know , we 're talking to Ed Snowden in Moscow . Very odd guy . But this is before he was doing any talking to anybody . PATINKIN You knew everyone at the CIA , the FBI and the GRU in Russia were listening in . You just knew it . I tried my butt off to get him to talk about personal stuff , but we could n't budge him from his soapbox . MCGAFFIN I did n't want to be identified , so I kept sliding Alex notes . I had him say , `` There 's a senior intelligence officer here , and he thinks he knows what 's going to happen to you . '' Snowden is all , `` What do you mean ? '' And I made Alex say , `` Sooner or later , when they 've gotten everything out of you , Putin is going to have you killed and make it look like the Americans did it . '' I hope he did n't sleep for weeks . GLATTER To make sure I got shoots correct , I looked up the most incendiary videos -- public hangings in Tehran , how to emigrate to ISIS , jihadi videos , beheadings . And I downloaded it on my home computer , like an idiot , and now I get strip searched every time I go through Heathrow . MCGAFFIN Another Spy Camp , I told everybody coming that their job was to make the writers understand how serious the threat of Russian election interference was . We did a whole season -LSB- season six -RSB- about that before anyone was talking about it . GLATTER That 's when I thought we jumped the shark . Then , of course , by the time we were airing it , that 's exactly what was going on in the news . GANSA When Trump was elected , all of the sudden we did n't have to bring these people in through separate entrances . The press and the `` deep state , '' if you want to call it that , were both really freaked out by this president . GLATTER Our advisers said that every president-elect who comes in for their first intelligence briefing leaves overwhelmed by the enormity of the task . They thought they understood what was going on in the world , but when you 're told what 's happening on a classified level , they realize how big the job is . That did not happen with Trump . JOHANNESSEN There was all of this Trump stuff we heard about -- Russian connections , the laundering of money into his places in Florida . Some of it became public during the -LSB- James -RSB- Comey stuff , but a lot of it did n't , and you 're sitting there wondering , `` Why not ? '' GANSA One thing that we learned is that you keep American foreign policy consistent from one administration to the next . The worst thing you can do is to backtrack , like to say no to the Climate Change Agreement or the Iran treaty . That is anathema for the intelligence community because it rocks the boat . It makes nobody trust us abroad . PART IV : Accused of peddling Islamophobia throughout its run , several events during production of the fifth season prompt Gansa and company to take a look at their portrayal of the Muslim world . GANSA During season five , I woke up at 4:30 in the morning to a panicked call from Germany . We 'd been punched by a bunch of German-Muslim artists we 'd hired to do the graffiti for our refugee camp set . Some of it , in Arabic , said stuff like `` Homeland is racist '' and `` Homeland is a watermelon . '' GORDON There was a central irony -LSB- to that response -RSB- . In the reductive way that people would say 24 was just executing talking points for George W. Bush and Roger Ailes , a similarly reductive assessment of Homeland is that it 's an answer , an apology or more nuanced story -- which it is . GANSA I thought , `` This is the greatest thing that could have happened . We are now going to become the center of a conversation about how America 's power is being discussed . '' GORDON We did go to great lengths to portray Muslim characters who had a broad range of views about the world . PATINKIN That 's been uncomfortable for all of us , the othering aspect . GANSA Then the worst thing that could have possibly happened did . I was on the plane , going to Germany to film a terrorist attack on a Berlin train station when the -LSB- 2015 -RSB- Paris attacks happened . That was the lowest point of the show for me . DANES There was always some parallel like that -- but the bombings and shootings in Paris , that 's what made me jumpy . I did n't know that were were always going to be mirroring current events so directly , that that would be such a part of the DNA of the show . GANSA So it 's just days later , and we were down in this abandoned subway with a bunch of Muslim actors wondering what the fuck we were doing . GLATTER We talked about it , had a moment for the people who had been lost . It was very important for everyone to be aware and take care of one another . GANSA Because the actors were like , `` Why are we doing this ? Are we perpetrating the stereotypes ? '' Even though the hero of that particular story was a Muslim guy who stopped the attack , it was happening right next door , and it was still so raw . PATINKIN I 'm not an idiot . I know terrorism and violence sells . That 's never going to change . I just want to bring the narrative of the polar opposite to at least move to a halfway point . GANSA If I had it to do all over again , knowing what had happened in Paris , we would 've told a different story -- but we were at a point where there was no turning back . But it did really influence the next three seasons because we came back to the States . GORDON And if anything , you showed the rot inside -LSB- America -RSB- from that hyper correction . PATINKIN This is a novel , this television series . Certainly , there are chapters that are n't helpful to one group or another -- and there was pushback on that , to say the least . But there was also a lot of care taken to make other people the bad guys -- white guys , the government , the CIA . But they did n't get as much attention as the terrorists . GANSA We 're now deconstructing the authorship of things . Sometimes , I 'm like , `` Do we have the right to write this ? '' I really do n't know . But if we started this show today ... GORDON Oh , we 'd be pilloried ! Pilloried ! PART V : Despite pleas from Showtime to continue , producers agree to an endgame for Homeland with a three-season renewal in 2016 . After several delays , in part because of Danes ' pregnancy and a lengthy Morocco shoot , the final season sends the story back to the Middle East . GORDON Ending the show ? It was a very short conversation . NEVINS It was a triangular negotiation between what the producers wanted , what the studio wanted and what we wanted . Alex really wanted to write to an end point . GANSA The economics of it were so strong that we all decided we could tell three more seasons . And frankly , the advent of Donald Trump really gave us fresh wind in our sails . SALKE The show demanded money based on how big of a production it became . -LSB- In its final season , Homeland 's budget swelled to more than double the first season 's $ 3 million per-episode price tag . Danes alone was making north of $ 500,000 an episode . -RSB- When Alex and Howard want to shoot the final season in the Middle East , you 're not doing it in Barstow . You 're going to Morocco . GANSA We thought we 'd go and tell one last story about Carrie Mathison doing what she was trained to do , serve as a case officer overseas . So , we went back abroad one more time . GLATTER We were told we had full Moroccan military support . So , in one scene we had two C130 -LSB- aircrafts -RSB- and a bunch of Humvees and helicopters as set dressing . All of a sudden , we get a bill for $ 230,000 . DANES We actually did the last days in Northridge , California . So the last shot , we 're filming in L.A. -LSB- in October -RSB- with raging fires . We should not have been filming , but we did n't have a choice . The crew was wearing masks . Of course , we 're ending this show in an inferno . GANSA Really , the entire run of the show has asked , `` Did America overreact to 9/11 ? Did we compromise our values ? Did we overreach ? '' I do n't think the world has found an answer . DANES We were so much about reflecting what was happening , politically , in the moment . How that ages , how we perceived it and what that exposes , in 10 years ' time , will be compelling to see . NEVINS You ca n't get to a finale of a long-running show without answering the dreaded -LSB- spinoff -RSB- question ... GANSA Every time Howard brings up doing more , I want to punch him . GORDON I 'm really just doing it to irritate him , but never say never . GANSA Howard gave his 40s to 24 . I gave my 50s to Homeland . And it got to a point where everyone wants to do something different . DANES I need this last season released into the world before it really ends for me , and then I 'm sure I 'll surface eventually . It 's going to be a long process of seeing who I am as an actor out of this show -- which has defined me for so long . I do n't know where to start , but I should play somebody decidedly sane . *** Who 's Who at Homeland 's `` Spy Camp '' The helpful experts -- at least those who can be revealed -- included generals , Pulitzer winners and an exiled whistleblower A. ELIZABETH JONES A foreign service officer for more than 35 years , Jones worked for the State Department in Kabul , Cairo , Amman , Baghdad and Berlin . `` Watching the impeachment hearings , '' says Glatter , `` she 'd literally be sitting right there in the gallery . Oh , that 's Beth . '' STANLEY A. MCCHRYSTAL A retired Army general who was once the head of the Joint Special Operations Command , at one point McChrystal was responsible for leading all U.S. forces in Afghanistan . He now teaches international relations at Yale University . DANA PRIEST The longtime Washington Post correspondent has two Pulitzer Prizes , including one for her beat reporting on the more incendiary features of the U.S. government 's counterterrorism campaign abroad -- including brutal interrogation techniques . EDWARD SNOWDEN Washington Post writer Bart Gellman , who ran point on coverage of Snowden 's release of top-secret documents , put the exiled former NSA contractor on an hours-long Spy Camp call before he appeared in a documentary or started giving interviews . MICHAEL HAYDEN Overseeing the NSA 's creation of domestic wiretaps during the George W. Bush administration , among other controversial moves , the onetime CIA director has since distanced himself from many conservative allies with his Trump criticism . *** Homeland : By the Numbers 7M : Weekly audience for its most watched season , No. 3 , across platforms 200 + : Territories across the globe that have licensed the series 8 : Emmy Wins , including two for Danes , out of 39 nominations 6 : Countries where the series filmed over its eight-season run 3 : AFI Awards for best television program -LRB- 2011 , 2012 and 2015 -RRB- 1 : Peabody Award for the series ' first season in 2011 This story first appeared in the Jan. 16 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine .

The Sisneros family was so poor that for many years it had no electricity or running water . When anyone took pictures of the Sisneros kids with their California cousins , it was easy to spot Francisco and his siblings . They were the ones without shoes . Francisco began elementary school in the little school in Ab\u00f3 , but it was soon evident that he was so bright that he needed a more challenging educational experience . By the third grade , he lived with his grandmother in Mountainair , where he excelled in school despite his grandmother 's belief that he would go blind from reading so much . Reading his treasured Weekly Reader and nearly every book in Mountainair 's public library , Francisco proved his grandmother wrong . By the time Francisco was ready for high school , he faced a dilemma . Most of the students who took college prep courses at Mountainair High School were Anglos . Hispanic kids usually took vocational courses with no hope of going on to college . Annie Chavez , who did take advanced college prep classes , graduated at the top of her class but received none of the available scholarships from the American Legion or the Daughters of the American Revolution . The only recognition Annie received was for her perfect attendance in all 12 years of school . Father John , the priest at Mountainair 's St. Alice 's Catholic Church , and Raymond Sisneros , the principal at Mountainair 's junior high , came to the rescue by sponsoring Francisco 's entrance into the Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary on the eastern outskirts of Santa Fe . Francisco was not sure if he wanted to be a priest , but the seminary offered the best education that he could receive in all of New Mexico . Passing the entrance exam and the required physical , Francisco looked forward to a new opportunity in his young life . Adjusting to life in a seminary Adjusting to life in a seminary was difficult for any young boy . It was especially hard for a boy like Francisco who had enjoyed so much freedom to play in Ab\u00f3 Viejo and its surrounding mesas and hills . Suddenly he faced an environment that was nothing like he had ever known . Arriving at the seminary in August 1962 , Francisco was joined by about 50 students in his first year of high school . Francisco 's classmates came from all parts of New Mexico and eastern Arizona . Although no one seemed to notice or care , about half of the boys were Hispanic and half were Anglo . All were top-rate students . Seminary students lived in large dormitories during their first two years of high school . In their third and fourth years , they lived in dorms with two to four students in each room . Francisco had to adjust not only to the dorms , but also to simple things like wearing pajamas to bed . He had never heard of pajamas , no less worn anything but underwear to sleep in . Not comfortable sleeping in pajamas , but required to wear them , Francisco put them on to go to bed , but removed them under the covers , slept well and put them back on just before he got up each morning . He was also not used to brushing his teeth with store-bought toothpaste . The nine members of his family had just used baking soda to brush their teeth each day . Francisco received few letters , but all student letters , coming and going , were censored by the school 's dean of students . Francisco always noticed that the seals on envelopes had been broken when he received mail . He 's still not sure what the priests were looking for when they censored student letters . Students were not allowed to use phones , listen to radios , hear music on record players or watch TV . Francisco remembers only two times when the rector pulled out an old black and white 12-inch wide TV so the entire student body could watch important events . The first time was in November 1963 when Francisco and his fellow students were at chapel and someone came in to tell them that President John F. Kennedy had been assassinated . They continued to say their prayers while the chapel bells tolled . Later , they watched several hours of live TV , including the president 's funeral procession and burial . The second time that Francisco remembers watching TV with his fellow seminarians -LRB- and 73 million other viewers -RRB- was when the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show on Feb. 9 , 1964 . No one at the Immaculate Heart of Mary sang along . The student body only got to sing when the boys sang Gregorian chants , accompanied by an organist sent from St. Francis Cathedral ; Francisco still has his copy of the Liber Usualis , the official Gregorian chant book . Otherwise , with the exception of brief moments after meals , strict silence was enforced at all times . Belonging to a band of silent brothers , Francisco knew little about his classmates and less about popular culture beyond the Beatles . An excellent education Despite the challenges of living in alien surroundings , Francisco and his fellow students received what most had come for -- an excellent education . Although strict and demanding , all their teachers were superior . They knew their subjects well and taught them expertly . But some priests favored certain students and gave them special attention . For example , only a few boys from Francisco 's music appreciation class got to go on a field trip to Los Alamos to hear a concert . Francisco was not among the chosen . Favored students were also invited to be on the school 's Model United Nations team that competed against other schools . Francisco was not asked to join the team , but was `` selected out of the blue '' to debate a student from a private school that was well known for its debating skills . Francisco was terrified that he would make a fool of himself . He does n't remember the debate topic , doing any research on it or actually debating . All he remembers is that the judges declared that he was the winner . Impressed by his teachers , Francisco remembers only a few stressful incidents . At least one priest , a Hispanic , made fun of Francisco 's English pronunciation , always asking him , `` Did you just get off the banana boat ? '' Francisco received an excellent education not only because he had good teachers , but also because he had an opportunity to take many more advanced subjects than he would have in most public high schools . These classes included anatomy and physiology , and four years of Latin . Curiously , no religion courses were given . But typing was taught by a nun at Loretto Academy once the female students at the school had gone home for the day . Francisco needed 18 courses to graduate . With so many advanced courses available , he finished with 24 . Daily life Daily life in a seminary was rigid and demanding . Students jumped out of bed at 6:30 a.m. , said their prayers , went to Mass and had breakfast . They returned to their rooms , made their beds and , with a break for lunch , spent most of the day attending classes . After dinner , they studied in quiet and went to bed by lights out at 9 p.m. Each day was much the same as all others . Four German nuns prepared the boys ' meals . The nuns had previously served at the seminary in Montezuma outside Las Vegas , N.M. , but came to Santa Fe when Montezuma was closed . Francisco says the nuns were good cooks , often using government commodities the school received for free . Francisco was especially fond of the cornbread and syrup the nuns served for breakfast . He also enjoyed the nuns ' homemade bread , sliced by a slicing machine he had never seen before . The nuns served a lot of beans and rice , but never used any German or Mexican recipes . Each meal began with a reading from the Bible . Francisco admired the German nuns for their hard work in preparing three meals a day , seven days a week for so many boys and their teachers . The nuns spent much of their time between meals saying their required daily prayers . They lived somewhere on campus , although Francisco never knew exactly where . There were no physical education classes , although there was a basketball team that Francisco describes as `` not very exciting and not very good . '' The team 's schedule included B or C teams from the New Mexico School for the Deaf , St. Catherine 's Indian School and a small private school on Canyon Road . Students were organized in groups under student leaders . There were five student crews , with each crew led by a second-year student . A chosen prefect -LRB- monitor -RRB- oversaw all crews and their leaders . By his second year , Francisco had the task of assigning jobs for his classmates to do throughout the week . Saturdays were reserved for cleaning everything from the dorms , the classrooms , the chapel and the only street on campus . Once completed , Francisco and the dean of students inspected the work . Francisco wore white gloves to check for dust and even ran a hanger over each bed to make sure the bed was made completely flat . The boys washed their own clothes , ironing not only the cassocks they wore , but also the shirts and black pants they wore beneath their black cassocks . Weekends , holidays and travel Students received visitors on one Sunday afternoon a month . Francisco remembers having very few visitors . Given the distance from their home in Ab\u00f3 Viejo and the cost of gasoline , his parents seldom visited him . An aunt from California visited once . Only a few other boys , including the seminarians from eastern Arizona , had so few visitors . Francisco only went home to visit on the Christmas and Easter holidays . Francisco 's sisters still kid him that they never missed him while he was gone because he teased them so relentlessly when he was home . During the summers , he worked at a job cleaning churches so he could earn enough money to return to school the following academic year . Fr . John drove Francisco from one parish to the next , with stops in towns as scattered as Tucumcari , Carrizozo , Vaughn and Santa Fe . As they drove , Fr . John helped Francisco practice his English pronunciation by having him repeat phrases such as , `` How now brown cow ? '' With enough practice , Francisco improved his diction considerably ; the priest back at the seminary finally stopped asking Francisco , `` Did you just get off the banana boat ? '' One summer , Sister Ernestina told Francisco that she needed him to drive her and her fellow German nuns to their Sister House in Amarillo , Texas . Francisco was only 14 , but he had learned to drive back home when he and his siblings drove their family 's truck to gather wood or do other chores . One of the nuns could drive their small car , but she was quite timid and afraid to drive long distances . Francisco drove while Sister Ernestina , a large woman , sat in the passenger 's seat beside him . Francisco remembers that the sister 's habit draped over the car 's gear shift , making it difficult for him to shift gears . The other three nuns squeezed into the back seat and spent most of the trip praying in German . Their prayers were answered when they made it safely to Amarillo and back . Francisco 's adventure was an odd version of `` Driving Miss Daisy , '' with Francisco playing the role of Hoke Colburn and Sister Ernestina starring in the role of Miss Daisy . Their trip to Texas would have made a great movie ! Some trouble As normal teenage boys , even seminary students got into a little bit of trouble . A mischievous act for Francisco and his friends was walking into Santa Fe and back just to see if they could get away with it . On one particularly daring day , Francisco and two or three other boys noticed that a visiting priest named Fr . Santillanes had parked his small Renault car along the street . Someone thought it would be clever to pick up the car and carry it into the study hall or a classroom in the school building . Their scheme worked until they found the school building was locked and they had no access to it . They had at least carried the car , left it at the school building 's door and made the priest go looking for it when it was time for him to leave . About 50 years later , Francisco happened to meet Fr . Santillanes at the Good Samaritan Village in Socorro . When the priest told the story of his disappearing car , Francisco confessed that he was part of the `` gang '' that had hijacked the vehicle . Francisco was happy to report that he was never caught or at least the priests did not `` press charges '' and might even have had a good laugh about it , although Francisco doubts it . Another daring seminary student decided to hang a pair of women 's pantyhose in his dorm room closet with a sign that read , `` Santa , please fill these for Christmas ! '' The dorm prefect found out about the teenage wish and had the pantyhose and sign removed . Francisco swears that he was not the culprit that time . Of course , panty raids were impossible in an all-boys school , but Francisco 's friends managed to have one anyway . Once when Francisco and some of his friends were hiking to Sun Mountain , they passed St. John 's College , then under construction . Apparently , the college dorms ' laundry room had not been completed and the students had to dry their clothes on an outside clothes line . Spotting female unmentionables on the line , two boys ran to the line and returned with their `` trophies . '' Again , Francisco denies being either of the culprits , although we might be suspicious since he was present for all three pranks . Students received demerits if they were caught breaking rules or engaging in pranks -- and getting caught . Francisco says the priests handed out demerits arbitrarily ; their favorite students never received one . If a boy `` racked up '' too many demerits , the priests called his parents and instructed them to pick up their wayward son the following day . The priests had deemed the student unable to adjust to the seminary 's institutionalization in preparation for a life of the cloth . Other students left because they did not measure up academically . But most boys who left school early were simply homesick , missing their families , friends , and the world they had left behind . Graduation day , May 1966 Graduation day was hardly elaborate or traditional in any way . There were no speeches or parties or tossing of mortarboards into the air . In fact , all Francisco remembers about graduation is taking his final exam . When done , a priest came by his desk , graded his exam and , having found that he had passed , handed Francisco his diploma . That was all there was after more than four years of so much work and sacrifice . A priest did meet with Francisco to discuss his future , or at least inform him that it had been decided he lacked a calling to become a priest and continue his studies in the seminary 's college department . But that was alright . Francisco had never decided whether he wanted to become a priest and , in his words , `` I may have been relieved that I did n't have to make that decision . '' All he knew was that he had gotten a superior education and was well prepared to enter college somewhere else . Of the 50 students who had started their seminary years with Francisco in 1962 , only 11 remained to graduate with him in 1966 . Of these graduates , only two went on to become priests . Francisco 's other fellow graduates have become deacons , doctors , lawyers , judges , law school deans , political activists , presidents of universities and even an expert on the history of rock and roll , including the Beatles . One has become a leader of the Jehovah 's Witnesses . Capt. Martin Flanning died in a helicopter crash in Vietnam . About five of Francisco 's fellow graduates joined him for their 50th class `` reunion '' at Teofilo 's in 2016 . And what became of the shoeless boy from Ab\u00f3 Viejo ? Francisco went on to graduate from the University of New Mexico , volunteer for the Peace Corps in Latin America , earn degrees in Latin American Studies , education and educational administration and serve as a school administrator with the Socorro public schools for 20 years , 1981-2001 . He also became the foremost expert on Hispanic genealogy in the state . Now retired , he spends much of his time writing wonderful poems and short stories about his childhood in Ab\u00f3 Viejo . And sometimes he recalls his years at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Seminary , acknowledging the ways that long-ago challenge has helped him through the many challenges of life . -LRB- La Historia del Rio Abajo is a regular column about Valencia County history written by members of the Valencia County Historical Society since 1998 .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrRbINZ", "title": "Born Slippy", "content": "Two weeks later , Frank and Dmitry were hanging the second-floor joists , one of those repetitive two-man jobs where you can have a decent conversation , sitting on top of opposite framed walls . `` Trog thinks your father was in the drug business , too , '' Frank said . Trog had met Dmitry 's father Edwin in the 1970s , smuggling hash up from Morocco for the English market -- Trog was smuggling hash , at any rate , and he suspected Edwin was as well , although Edwin never copped to it , and had a front as an importer of rugs and kilims and antiques , never letting on otherwise . On the ferry between Algeciras and Tangier , Trog could be mistaken for little except what he was , an American hippie drug dealer , but Edwin might have been a schoolteacher , an archeologist , a mining engineer . One day , the bartender in Trog 's local pub in Hackney whispered to him that some very square guy , reeking of Interpol , had been around asking questions . Trog decided it was time to close shop and head back to the hill country of Massachusetts . He packed up his British wife Catherine and a box of books and flew home . He grew a little weed behind his house but was otherwise retired . `` Franky , the simple fact is this : I know nothing about my father , '' he said . Having had a tough father himself , the kind of guy who would beat the crap out of you one minute and give you big hugs -LRB- and a sermon -RRB- the next , and who died young -- his anger , Frank always assumed , causing an aneurysm to burst in his brain before he hit sixty -- Frank was completely prepared for the I hate my father talk . And , frankly , where else do you go after I know nothing about him ? `` What do you mean you know nothing ? '' `` Nothing . '' `` Was he a drinker ? '' Frank asked . `` No . '' `` Angry ? '' `` No , mild-mannered to a fault , '' Dmitry said . `` He is like , I do n't know -- he 's like the clerk at the shop where you buy your bread , or your auto parts salesman , excuse me salesperson , someone you do n't really take any notice of , a nonentity . '' They pulled the twenty-foot-long slabs of fir into place , their legs dangling into what would be the living room , slipping each board into galvanized hangers , and toed a few 10d nails into the plate and end joist , a task which always took Frank half the time it took Dmitry on his end . `` You 're killing me . You 're getting paid by the hour , '' Frank said for the umpteenth time . `` I 'm getting paid by the house . '' Dmitry would then stop altogether , and say , `` But , Franky ! You own the means of production -- for instance , you own this hammer -- and my surplus labor is going into your pocket . '' Frank had been telling him about Marx , his latest reading , and proud as he was of his autodidactic accomplishments , he also wondered how much of it he had wrong . When Dmitry finally finished nailing , they grabbed the next joist and slid it in . `` I mean , he was a smuggler of some sort , right ? '' Frank said . `` That makes him at least mildly interesting . Morocco in the '70s ? That 's interesting . '' `` Perhaps , '' Dmitry said . But he did n't seem to be really thinking about it . He had lost interest . They talked some other nonsense for a while , and then , out of the blue , Dmitry said , `` I realize now that you are right , Franky , that my father would have been an excellent smuggler , because like any proficient spy he is so ordinary he would never in a million years be suspected or even noticed . You look at him and your eye is immediately drawn elsewhere , not because he 's hideous or repulsive or anything , but because he 's unable to inspire interest . Look at him a split second and you find yourself contemplating the picnic table next to him , or the yew hedge behind him , or the grass to the left of his shoe , all of which seem more engaging . '' He thought for a moment , sank a nail . `` And if he was a spy , it would explain everything ... '' He trailed off , but then , slipping the next joist in , said , `` Yes , that 's it , Franky . My daddy is MI6 . Hence the fancy electronic gear in the attic . '' `` Seriously ? '' `` Deadly serious . '' He was n't . `` And perhaps this is true of all successful spies ; there is no way of knowing whether he is one unless he were to be arrested . Then we 'd all go on the telly , like the neighbors of serial murderers , and say , he was always so quiet . '' `` Why do n't you ask him ? '' `` Ask him if he 's a spy ? '' he said , with a half laugh , followed by a moment of hesitation . Why he could n't hit a nail while he was thinking Frank would never understand , and asking would just mean they 'd waste more minutes while he explained . `` You do n't understand , Franky . He 's not a man you ask questions . It 's not a psychological thing -- well , it is psychological I suppose , but not about my psychology , and not his exactly -- even if you intend to ask him a question , one look at him and you realize you ca n't , any more than you could ask a tree , or a cow '' -- and here he let out one of his distressingly regular , long-burst farts , the result of eating a pound of Oreo cookies every day -- `` I mean you can , after all , ask him what time it is or whether he would mind passing the butter . You just ca n't ask him a real question . It 's as if some force field surrounds him that transmogrifies every serious query into , Look like rain to you ? -- or no , not even that , that 's too ominous : Right , then ? That 's all you can ask : Right , then ? His answer , ineluctably , is , Yes , right , then . I 'm not kidding , Franky . Somehow , alchemically , or like an invisible centrifuge taking your words and separating out all their meaning , conversation is drained of content . Right , then ? '' He paused in fake anticipation . `` Right-o ! '' They slipped another twenty-foot joist into its hangers . `` Do n't get me wrong , '' he added . `` He 's a perfectly pleasant chap . Perfectly pleasant . '' `` I do n't know , '' Frank said . `` Maybe that 's not such a bad way for a father to be , kind of neutral . '' Dmitry sighed . `` Honestly , Franky , you have to get over your father , you really do . Yes , he was a little brutal , OK , '' he said , and added , in his American guy accent , `` Hey , really , it 's hanging you up , man , '' and then , back in his own voice , `` That stuff with your dad . Let it go . I 'm so much younger than you and already I do n't really care about my father 's non-entityness . I do n't , Franky , it 's just that you asked . '' Frank was shocked , since most of the time whatever he said seemed to act simply as prompts for further tangential monologue on Dmitry 's part , and the last thing he expected was any insight . But Dmitry was right that he spent too much time pitying himself for his tragic youth . His father was complicated . He should get over it . He was careening toward thirty . It was time to let his dead father stay dead . They were lowering the last joist into place , a natural endpoint for the conversation . `` I do n't think I did ask , '' Frank said . `` Yes , yes , Franky , '' he said slowly , in the patient schoolteacher mode he reserved for whenever Frank did n't get a joke . `` I know you did n't . Try to keep up . '' They tacked the last joist in place , stood up and stretched . Paul was supposed to come after work each day and put in a few hours , but never did . Sometimes he had to work late , sometimes his wife made him come home , sometimes his kids were in a play or had a soccer game or a dentist 's appointment . Yes , it pissed Frank off : I may not be much , he thought to himself , but I 'm an honest man , and Paul may not have been intentionally lying -LRB- except to his wife , Margie , about their business plan -RRB- , but liar or not , he never came after work , except to check in for a half hour . And he did fairly short days on the weekends too , at most . Since he was n't much with a hammer , when Frank did the math , he figured it only cost the project a percent or two , Paul flaking off like that , but it still irked . And the upside was that , until Dmitry arrived , he had the tent to himself . From sundown to sunrise he could read unmolested , a utility light hanging from the ridgepole . The setup was kind of perfect for that -- no TV , no nothing , alone with his books . Even after Dmitry got there , he managed to read through the guy 's snoring an hour or so before falling asleep and an hour in the morning . He always read during lunch and he made Dmitry drive when they went into town so he could get a few more pages in . Struggling through the glorious The Sound and the Fury at night , and reading Beyond Good and Evil during the day , he was swirling in a world of coincidence -- every line he read in Nietzsche seemed to explain Faulkner and vice versa . Talking much about oneself can also be a means to conceal oneself , Nietzsche says , for instance , and all those characters in The Sound and the Fury , what else do they do ? And when he says that distrust and doubt are healthy , that anything unconditional is pathological -- Faulkner meant Quentin as perfect proof . And Frank loved the idea that he was using such a tiny amount of fossil fuel energy . His entire home consumption consisted of a single lightbulb a few hours a night . He bathed in a small pond . He used the woods as a toilet . Yes , his tools used a lot of energy building the house , as did his truck , running to the lumberyard . But that was business . In his private life he was almost fossil-fuel-free . He was saving the planet every day . The downside of the whole arrangement , aside from the mess Dmitry made of the tent , was Margie . On weekends she would show up on the site and be a general pain in the ass , like all career-less clients anywhere . He tried to tell himself that she was n't a real client , that she was n't going to move in anyway , but it did n't help . She changed her mind and made him rip out perfect work and redo it slightly differently , like a lot of rich people do -- make a closet six inches bigger , move a window two inches to the right -- but more aggravating was the fact that her default expression was mild disgust , as if no matter what she was talking about , she was , at the same time , noticing that you smelled like a dead possum . Dmitry 's arrival helped ; she had someone she found even more distasteful than Frank . He knew it happened in lots of places -- migrant farmers ' camps , people building roads in the High Pamir , all those guys working the mines in the Andes -- but for an average adult American , living in a tent with another grown man is a little out of the ordinary . Even most homeless people do n't share their makeshift shelters . It 's hard enough putting up with another person when you 're having sex with them -- to have to live in the same room with their dirty laundry and farting through the night and the rest of it and get no love or sex ? Like prison . And as with prison , he started to recognize a forced camaraderie , accidental bonding . He was almost ten years older than Dmitry , so felt like a mentor , a teacher to his student , and that gave him some satisfaction . `` Every man has his price , people say , '' he read out loud one night , sitting on a crate as Dmitry laid back on his air mattress , cutting his overgrown toenails . `` This is not true . But for every man there exists a bait which he can not resist swallowing . To win over certain people to something -- you 're going to pick up that disgusting crud , are n't you ? -- it is only necessary to give it a gloss of love of humanity , nobility , gentleness , self-sacrifice -- and there is nothing you can not get them to swallow . To their souls , these are the icing , the tidbit ; other kinds of souls have others . '' `` Wait , Franky , '' Dmitry said . `` Who is swallowing what ? '' `` He 's saying that we can all get suckered into anything if people appeal to some sense of self , or some vanity -- '' `` Yes , yes , Franky , but first he says a man 's price is a bait he ca n't resist swallowing , and if he takes the bait , then you can get him to swallow anything -- it 's like an improperly mixed metaphor . '' `` But the point -- '' `` Yeah , the point -- but what 's the icing , the bait they swallow or the stuff they swallow because they swallowed the bait ? '' `` The bait , '' Frank said , but then he wondered . Maybe not . It did n't matter . These discussions , even when he was unsure , made him feel smart . `` What 's your bait , Franky ? '' Dmitry asked . He thought about it . It was probably the desire to be seen as smart , well-read , like he was trying to do right then . And his boat . His boat was his bait . Or his icing . His idea had always been , during those years , that one day , after learning how to build staircases and bookshelves , additions and outbuildings for people , how to do kitchens and baths and cabinets , he would be able to fulfill his lifelong dream and build a big wooden sailboat for himself . He could live on it . He could go down the coast to Florida , up to Canada , again , fossil-fuel-free . The fact that he might never put the money together , that he knew nothing about boatbuilding , that he had yet to bend a board or use fiberglass , that the entirety of what he knew about sailing was based on an hour on a Sunfish in Lake Hopatcong when he was ten : these things did n't at all diminish his enthusiasm . His boat -- that was his bait . And the money he was going to make with Paul . And the love of a good woman . And a new truck with an extended cab . And -- what was n't his bait ? `` I think , '' Dmitry said when he did n't answer , `` it is exactly what Nietzsche said : the gloss of humanity , nobility . That 's what you want . You want to be Gandhi or Martin Luther King . Not be them , actually , but receive the adulation they got . That , and your ocean-going sailboat . And pussy . '' `` Pussy ! '' Frank scoffed . `` Oh , yes , Franky , you think you hide it , but you are an insatiable pussy hound . You ca n't see a woman and not think about it . '' `` That 's not true , '' he said . `` Margie , Tracy -- the list goes on and on . '' `` Yes , but that list is not very long , is it -- it 's two -- and we both know those two women scare you , and neither will have you . You 've got no moral high ground there . I 'm surprised you have n't had an accident when you drive , the way you stare at even the most marginally attractive women walking down the street . '' `` Like you do n't . '' `` Of course , I do ! But I know the value of pussy in my -- what did you call it ? -- my hierarchy of human needs , Franky . '' `` That 's not what Maslow 's talking about . '' `` Well I think it is -- in fact I 'm quite sure it is -- what I 'm talking about . Or was . Now I 'm going to sleep . '' But true to form he was n't finished , and after three or four beats he went on . `` I wonder if other people have people who read for them . Like literary servants , literary butlers , people who give them little digests of this book or that . It 's much more efficient than reading them yourself . '' `` But you miss so much -- reading is n't about efficiency . '' `` I 'm not sure . We can check in two weeks . We 'll see who remembers more about Beyond Good and Evil -- me or you . Or if efficiency is n't the right word , tell me what is : the benefit remains the same , but the cost gets cut almost in half , two people get the benefits of reading and only one has to read . It 's remarkably efficient . '' `` What about pleasure ? '' `` I 'm all for it , Franky . '' `` The pleasure of reading . '' `` Ah , but it has to be weighed against other pleasures , does it not ? After all , we are , as you say , condemned to reproduce ourselves as workers and manufacture surplus value for our evil capitalist masters -- that would be you and Paul -- and that only leaves so much time for the pursuit of pleasure . And ` Time , ' I believe Quentin Compson 's father tells him , does n't he , Franky , ` Time is man 's misfortune . ''' He was an excellent student and had an uncanny memory for these bits Frank would read aloud out of pure exuberance . Much later , after everything that happened , Frank no longer found much pleasure in the Great Books -- he suspected they mocked him , that they , in a way , had written his own downfall , his own eventual exile . But back then he was elated by them , thrilled when he read one , and thrilled again when he read the best parts to his tent-mate or anyone else who would listen . Dmitry did n't get the time quote exactly right : `` Man is the sum of his misfortunes , '' Mr. Compson says . `` One day you 'd think misfortune would get tired , but then time is your misfortune . '' Amen , Mr. Bill Faulkner , Frank thought , although he supposed Dmitry 's version was more efficient . Dmitry had berated Faulkner for another logical inconsistency , because elsewhere Mr. Compson says that `` Only when the clock stops does time come to life . '' Dmitry had a complicated argument about why both statements ca n't be true , something to the effect that if they were , we could avoid all misfortune by watching the clock . And to top it off , Dmitry said , Mr. Compson was a pompous ass . Maybe . Not that it matters , in the long run . Despite Frank acting as Dmitry 's teacher part of the time , they were basically fraternal . They spent almost every hour of ten weeks together , eating , sleeping , talking , working , drinking , going to the strip club , eating , talking , sleeping , working . They got confessional , on occasion , telling each other stories they did n't often tell , even if they were somewhat plagiaristic , as Fitzgerald says , the dramatis personae borrowed from central casting and the plots marred by obvious suppressions . They had shared some of their dreams , however shopworn , however often they had been checked out from the local dream library before . They dissected their family lives and romantic histories . They got philosophical , speculative , utopic , dialectical . They got to know each other . They were young men , eighteen and twenty-six , and therefore both still quite confused about sex , or maybe just Frank was . As in all male intimacies , there were vast , unmentioned continents , unspoken-for and unspoken-about territory . And at the same time , as in all male intimacies , they could sometimes indulge in unexpected , bitter honesty . `` My older sister , Franky , '' Dmitry said , as they were falling asleep on their respective air mattresses one night in the moldy canvas tent , reeking by then of their dirty laundry , `` was the constant companion of my puberty . As I was first sprouting mons pubis hair , she was there to point it out to me , and then -- you can imagine , Franky , how thrilling this was for a twelve-year-old boy -- she offered as a comparative study the observation of her own sparse , fourteen-year-old curls . As my erections grew more -- because I know you value a certain amount of sexual politesse , Franky , I 'll just say , as they grew more insistent -- she showed me a number of things that could be done with said erections . When I experienced my first orgasm , it was under her hand , as it were . '' Frank did n't say anything , and Dmitry looked at him sideways . `` We live in a society that frowns on such things , Franky . One might even say that they are taboo . '' `` Duh . '' `` Yeah , no , really , duh . And yet you do not react with the disgust which , we are told by the anthropologists and ethnologists , the thwarting of such taboos should engender . '' He was being parodic , speaking in some caricature of academese , some burlesque of learned discourse . Making fun of the way Frank talked about books , in other words . `` Why do you think that is ? '' `` Freud says childhood sexuality is normal . '' `` Ah , '' he said , mocking Frank 's evasiveness . `` But this was n't normal , was it , Franky ? '' He paused , then went on . `` As we got older , I began to find it all quite confusing . She would come home from a date and tell me how in love she was with Micky or Jake , and how magnificently they had just made love to her in their car , or in the woods , and how wonderful it made her feel , and then she would grab me , find me aroused , and mount me . She would be especially wet at such times , Franky , and at some point I came upon the only reasonable and necessary conclusion available to me , the conclusion that me own sister was a bit of a hussy , perhaps even a bit of a who-er . '' This was supposed to be funny , and he tried to toss it off lightly , but he could n't avoid betraying , Frank thought , a deep sadness . Then again , whether this was revelation or bullshit , he could n't say . He knew nothing . He sure as hell did not see Dmitry 's future coming , could never have guessed in a million years that the Strange and Fantastical Life of Dmitry Heald , the whole stupendous , horrific , glorious mess , would turn out to be what it catastrophically turned out to be . He never thought he 'd have any reason to deeply regret it all , to shudder whenever he reviewed the gory tale of their friendship . 2002 If you had asked Frank , at the end of that long summer , if he 'd ever see Dmitry again , he would have said absolutely not . Dmitry had proven himself not just a lousy worker and a horrible slob , but a full-out criminal , and he had fucked over Frank in a half dozen ways -- and , well , long story short , Dmitry was back in England , so chances were slim to none they 'd run into each other . Frank had never been west of Pennsylvania or east of Rhode Island , so how would he end up in England ? When they finished the house in Connecticut , Paul and Margie moved into it instead of selling it , and that was Dmitry 's fault , too -- he had completely tanked Frank 's relationship with Paul , everyone 's relationship with everyone , and by the time he left , all was fucked , and Paul was n't about to be reminded of the debacle every day by working with Frank . Paul 's excuse was that his wife had forced his hand , made him keep the house because she `` fell in love with it '' -- and of course she fell in love with it , since it was tricked out with the best plumbing fixtures and surfaces money could buy : expensive tile , overpriced cabinets , the latest granite countertops , more bathrooms than a family could ever use . Paul never paid him anything , the scumbag , beyond the starvation wages he charged to their joint venture to feed Frank 's busted family and keep him in American cheese sandwiches for five months . When Frank ran the numbers , he ended up with a considerably lower hourly rate than he paid Dmitry . He knew that Paul was angry with him , that he blamed him for Dmitry 's various crimes , and that it gave Paul a certain amount of satisfaction to screw him out of his half . Frank walked away with a pile of credit card debt and Paul walked away with a house now worth a million dollars . And Paul was mad at Frank . Chief John Ross had it right , Frank thought : we never forgive our victims .", "url": "https://www.guernicamag.com/born-slippy/", "kws": ["Slippy", "Trog", "love", "man", "Duh", "misfortune", "English", "rain", "Tangier", "sundown", "Marx", "Edwin", "American^^cheese^^sandwiches", "perfect^^proof", "Franky", "mild^^disgust", "pussy", "home", "opposite^^framed^^walls", "childhood^^sexuality"], "text_category": {}}

Shok -- as the founder of MeUndies had become known in federal prison -- shook himself awake , pissed . The 29-year-old from Beverly Hills had gotten used to sleeping in a cell , but actual sleep was sometimes hard to come by , given that his bed was across the hall from the `` black TV room '' -LRB- as everyone called it -RRB- . Guys could get noisy in there . And on this morning , as the halls of the prison were still largely quiet , they were having a heated conversation about politics with the door wide open . So , scrawny as Shok had become behind bars , he got out of bed determined to shut their door -- even if it led to a confrontation . What he found , in the middle of that room , was an intimidating dude named Grease , who could n't have been less happy to see him -- and who , to both of their great surprise , would help define a new direction for MeUndies . But at that moment , nobody was talking business . The question was which one of them would end up on a stretcher . And really , it was n't much of a question . Where to start . SHOK / Zip Code 90210 In early 1985 , Jonathan Shokrian was born into a clutch of Persian Jews in Beverly Hills . Most had fled the 1979 revolution when Iran became Islamic , figuring they 'd go back when it all blew over . But Shokrian grew up sensing the struggle of a community that realized they were stuck here . `` There was a big identity crisis between the old world that our parents came from and this new world that we were living in , '' he says . `` I was told how I had to dress , who I could date . I was forced to take Farsi classes and groomed into taking over the family business . '' He had n't even graduated college at Southern Methodist University in Texas when he started working for his dad 's real estate company . But Shokrian found that business cutthroat and impersonal . At the same time , he compared himself to his childhood friends , who were doing amazing things . Escaping like a heady steam from their tiny pressure cooker of a Persian Jewish community , they 'd been launching some of the buzziest startups of the moment -- companies like FabFitFun , Alfred Coffee , and Sweetgreen . Shokrian could feel the intensity of their entrepreneurialism ; it pushed them not only to be part of this American culture but to define it . `` I had never been more excited by anything , '' he says . `` I started obsessively thinking about what my own thing could be . '' In 2011 , Shokrian was packing for a European vacation with Sweetgreen 's cofounder Jonathan Neman and ran to Macy 's to pick up a pair of underwear . There in Dallas 's Northpark mall , he was embarrassed to have to ask a female employee where the men 's underwear was . -LRB- `` I know it sounds silly , '' he says . -RRB- Then he dropped nearly $ 30 for a pair of Calvin Kleins that turned out to be a bad fit . On the trip , he vented about it . `` We were jetlagged , drinking coffee in a caf\u00e9 in Amsterdam , and Jon 's like , ` Someone should make underwear better and sell it online , ' '' says Neman . `` And then literally right there , he logs on to the internet and finds the guy who had UnderwearClub.com and offers him , like , $ 5,000 for the URL . That 's how Jon works . '' That deal fell through , and anyway , as they traveled , Shokrian decided that the name of his nascent underwear company should have more attitude . `` I personally struggled with body image and confidence , '' he says , `` and every ad I saw out there was so alienating , like you had to have a six-pack or wings on your back . '' He wanted to build a company that made everyone feel good in their skivvies , which meant the messaging had to be as comfortable as the fabric . He liked the cheeky way the English called their intimates `` undies , '' and because at the core the company would be about self-expression , Shokrian stuck the `` me '' in front . And there it was : MeUndies . Back home in L.A. , he found a student designer on Craigslist to sketch out prototypes . Then he set out to raise money . He 'd previously invested in his friends ' startups , so they now returned the favor . He also took money from a new incubator called Science , which was helping to build some of the biggest direct-to-consumer , subscription-based companies . Dollar Shave Club was starting there . So was DogVacay . Shokrian wanted MeUndies to run on a subscription model as well , which in theory would create recurring revenue while saving his customers from awkward trips to Macy 's . `` When Jonathan showed me his artwork , '' says Science cofounder Mike Jones , former CEO of MySpace , `` it was like this beautiful blend of a non-gender-conformity-building , modern , fresh approach . It felt like the anti -- Victoria 's Secret , the anti-Jockey . And that felt very next-generation . '' But Shokrian would n't be the star of Science . That honor went to Dollar Shave Club , which quickly exploded in popularity -LRB- and would later sell for $ 1 billion -RRB- . At MeUndies , six months after launching in December 2011 , Shokrian 's team of three was cramped in his father 's office , out of cash and pretty much out of inventory . He considered quitting but decided to give it one last shot , taking a loan from his dad to buy more product . That tided them over into the holidays and led MeUndies to its first $ 100,000 month . And on that momentum , Shokrian went on another fundraising tour and found some interest . `` The basics market was just stale , '' says Tyler Winklevoss , who 'd become an investor , `` and did n't speak to the modern consumer either in sensibility or purchasing channel . It was ready for a fresh newcomer . '' Shokrian raised $ 1 million and moved MeUndies into its own warehouse . As he relentlessly pushed to sell product , his tactics were sometimes at odds with his ambition to build a body-positive brand . `` Every major brand at the time used some form of sexualized content in order to drive attention , '' he says . `` In the early days , that 's all I knew . '' And so MeUndies hired seductive models to flaunt its underwear and even launched its socks on a new high-end porn site . `` Some of our early campaigns I 'm really proud of and others , you know , I 'm not , '' he admits . Say what you will , and people said a lot , the strategy tripled revenues . By 2013 , the team -- now around 10 strong -- was relieved to be over the hump . `` And then EPA agents showed up at my door , '' says Shokrian . `` They told me they were prosecuting me . '' GREASE / South Central L.A. . While Shokrian was growing up in one of the world 's fanciest neighborhoods , a boy named Joe Nickson was coming of age in South Central L.A. , infamous for gangs like the Neighborhood Crips and the Bloods , and crack . Nickson 's father managed logistics for a security company ; his mother worked as a home nurse . They split up when Nickson was about 6 but sent their son -- their only child together -- to school in suburban San Fernando Valley to keep him out of trouble . Nickson loved his classes but felt torn between two realities . `` I would go to different sleepovers , have different vernaculars , '' he says . `` I would hear about Tony Hawk in elementary school and when I went back home , the new Eazy-E and Snoop Dogg albums . I could relate to both worlds , but I never felt that I belonged to either . So in my adolescent years , I started acting out , just to try to reversely fit in . '' At 16 , he joined the Neighborhood Crips and started `` flocking . '' It worked like this : Nickson , who inherited the street name Grease because he was too slick to get caught , would set out with his crew , dressed like basketball players selling candy , or they 'd put on white shirts with black ties , get some pamphlets , and pretend to be Jehovah 's Witnesses . Then they 'd `` flock '' to wealthy parts of town like migrating birds and knock on doors . If no one was home , they 'd break in . It all ended rather abruptly , he says , when one of the houses they burglarized belonged to a district attorney . The laptop Nickson stole had a tracker in it . Nickson was sent to fire camp , an alternative to prison for first-time offenders . He was there only a few months . On the day he returned back home , a member of the Bloods pulled up in front of him in a Camaro , rolled down the window , and tossed out an envelope . `` When you ready to get some money , come holler at me , '' the man said . The envelope contained $ 5,000 in cash . Nickson hollered and was soon robbing banks . In four months , his crew hit more than 10 . `` We got out of hand , '' he says . But one time really sticks with him : He was masked and armed , heisting a Bank of America on March 12 , 2001 . He 'd already stuffed his long johns with cash and was heading away from a sign that said , of all things : `` Easier Access : What are you waiting for ? '' Then , a kid -- maybe 4 years old -- popped up out of nowhere . `` He runs up to me and he puts his hand like mocking a gun and he says , ` Freeze ! ' '' Nickson recalls . `` And I say , ` Little man , where 's your mommy ? ' And she says , ` I 'm right here . ' '' Nickson grabbed the boy by the hand and brought him to his mother . This was the first time he really thought about the people he victimized . And he said to himself , I 'm not supposed to be doing this . He quit hitting banks , but the police still caught up with him . Nickson was convicted of conspiracy and bank robbery and took a plea on three additional bank robberies . On June 6 , 2005 , he was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison . He was 25 . SHOK / Dallas Shokrian 's run-in with the feds -- the reason the EPA showed up at his door -- went back to a critical mistake he made when he was 23 . Before starting MeUndies , when he was working for his father , he convinced his dad to buy and fix up a huge , run-down 1950s shopping center called Fazio 's . The place was a wreck -- rats , holes in the roof , buckled floor tiles , asbestos allegedly in the glue holding them together . Some forms of asbestos are unregulated and do n't require the full , heavily controlled -LRB- and expensive -RRB- removal process . Shokrian 's construction consultant , according to court records , said the building contained this kind of asbestos . So , eager to make his dad proud and get the place renovated quickly , Shokrian outfitted his workers with masks and respirators , and went about renovations . But the project made news when workers used gasoline to clean the tiles , which caught the attention of the EPA . The agency decided to investigate and determined that the asbestos did need to be removed according to regulations . `` I tried to tell them it was an honest mistake , '' says Shokrian , `` and that I would never intentionally put someone in harm 's way . '' The Shokrians paid a $ 500,000 fine , took asbestos removal training , and started monitoring the workers for health issues . And everybody moved on . Except that , four years later , out of the blue , the case came back . After the agents showed up at Shokrian 's door , he was accused of failure to notify under the Clean Air Act . `` I never thought a judge in his right mind would send me to jail , '' says Shokrian . But that 's what happened . `` This was not a case in which -LSB- Shokrian -RSB- set about to injure the environment , '' Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater said at his sentencing hearing in Dallas . But the law is the law : He sentenced Shokrian to federal prison for a year and a day . The founder of MeUndies had 45 days to self-surrender . `` We were shocked , '' says Neman , the Sweetgreen cofounder , who flew in for support along with others . `` It felt like a final supper . '' GREASE and SHOK / Terminal Island Nickson was 12 years into his sentence and doing time at Terminal Island , in L.A. 's harbor -- transferred to the minimum-security facility for good behavior -- when Jonathan Shokrian showed up there to begin his own imprisonment . It was April 15 , 2014 . Shokrian had left MeUndies in good hands . He 'd chosen a CEO to run the business and had taken his team out to dinner to buoy their spirits . He knew that , as a federal prisoner , he 'd be prohibited from conducting business while incarcerated , but he planned to stay in as close touch as he could . At the office , the MeUndies staff set up a special Golden Eagle Trimstyle phone -- red for drama -- just for when Shokrian called . `` I felt very confident the company would survive my absence , '' he says . His own survival felt less certain . `` I was scared , '' he says . `` I mean , I 'm from this very sheltered Jewish Persian family in Beverly Hills . '' He hired a prison consultant -LRB- an actual thing -RRB- , who prepped him on how to stay out of trouble . And once inside , that 's what Shokrian did . The other inmates started calling him Shok , and he kept focused on journaling daily , reading , and , as soon as he could get sneakers , running 50 miles a week . Shok thought a lot about MeUndies and was frustrated by not being able to contribute more . He could send emails via the prison-monitored CorrLinks and make limited calls , but he had to be careful . `` I was able to make suggestions and get updates , '' he says . `` But there was this very , very fine line I had to walk . '' Shok 's first-ever hire , Noah Taubman , came regularly to the visitors room , with its sad vending machines . `` Jon would always show up with a piece of paper and go , ` How 's this going ? How 's that going ? ' '' says Taubman , senior project manager . `` He would have us print out the MeUndies Instagram feed and mail it to him , then go through it and comment and mail it back . It was surreal to see his complete reversal . He always wanted to control everything , and he had controlled everything . Now he was in an off-white jumpsuit , three sizes too big . His hair was short . He had lost a crap-ton of weight . That was scary . '' But then , one fateful early morning , Shok said , Screw it . He 'd had enough . The TV Room Terminal Island is home to some 1,150 inmates , and , as is common in prison , they tend to divide themselves by race . Shok 's bed was across the hall from a TV room used by black men -- `` like a barbershop , '' as Nickson describes it , where the guys would hang out and converse . And they kept the door open so it would n't get too hot . `` So one day around 7 o'clock , '' Nickson says , `` Mr. Privileged comes in , looks around , and closes the door . '' Mr. Privileged was , of course , Shok . And Nickson -- or Grease to everyone in prison -- reopened the door . From there , the men forget exactly how they nearly came to blows . Grease : `` I already have it in my mind that if he closes -LSB- the door -RSB- again , I 'm going to smash the collarbone off his shoulders . Can you believe what his first words to me are ? ` All I hear is your fucking mouth . ' '' Shok : `` Well , no . He said , ` If you touch the door one more time , you little punk-ass bitch , it 'll be the last door you touch . ' And then I was like , ` I would n't be touching the door if I did n't have to hear your loud-ass mouth . ' '' Grease : `` And as sure as the sun came up , he came in and attempted to -LSB- close the door -RSB- again . '' Shok : `` I forgot where I was . I mean this guy 's like six feet and ripped . I 'm like five nine , a skinny Jewish kid , and he 's about to knock me out . '' Grease : `` I was going to beat the -- oh , yes , I was . And then one of the other guys , said , ` Hey , man , come on . ' '' Shok apologized , and the two ate dinner together that night . `` The connection , '' says Grease , `` was instantaneous . '' After that , they started walking the track , working out , and making special meals together . They talked about life , family , and integrity . If the two had led impossibly different lives , they shared a sense of being torn between worlds . Shok wanted to understand how a guy as smart as Grease was robbing banks . Grease wanted to know everything about MeUndies . `` Grease 's energy was beyond anything I had seen , '' says Shok . `` He was passionate , full of life and ideas , resourceful . He was always laughing . We were very , very close . '' One day Grease came racing from the TV room with news about a Dallas Cowboys running back , telling Shok , `` Joseph Randle just got arrested for stealing underwear from Dillard 's . You have to do something with it . '' Grease had a point ; the player could have just bought underwear online ! It played right into the MeUndies brand story . Back at HQ , the red phone rang . Greg Fass , senior brand manager , picked it up . `` Jon was like , ` We 've got to reach out . We 've got to get involved in the conversation , ' '' he says . So they jumped on it . Adam Schefter , NFL insider at ESPN , was tweeting about how expensive Randle 's stolen underwear was , considering the fine the Cowboys organization was about to slap him with . So using the MeUndies Twitter account , Fass tweeted back : `` @AdamSchefter if you see him , tell Joseph Randle that we 'll pay his fine . We hate buying underwear from dept stores too #DirectToConsumer . '' Schefter responded by putting them in touch with Randle 's people . MeUndies worked out an endorsement deal where it would help cover the $ 29,500 fine in return for Randle doing charitable appearances and donating $ 15,000 in underwear to those in need . Back in prison , Grease and Shok ran to the nearest TV to watch their stunt unfold on the news . `` I had to get him an honorary seat in the black TV room , '' says Grease . Then they saw it , right there on the screen -- Grease 's idea , transported from behind bars and out into the world . It was nothing short of an awakening . `` When I was robbing banks , I was doing it for the adrenaline rush , '' he says . `` This was that feeling times 10 . I thought : This is euphoria . This is what I want to do for the rest of my life . '' The Randle story quickly went viral . In the crush of media , MeUndies got slammed for sponsoring a thief . -LRB- And as it turns out , Randle has gotten in repeated trouble since . -RRB- But Shokrian leaned into the controversy . If MeUndies was under fire , it was also in the spotlight , and the team responded by emphasizing the charitable outcome . `` It really proved to me the power of timing and going live with something that 's socially relevant , '' he says . He also saw Grease 's potential and encouraged him to come up with more ideas for MeUndies . `` Jon told me , ` Bro , you got it , ' '' says Grease . Three months later , Grease spotted another opportunity on the news . With the Super Bowl approaching , Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch was fined for grabbing his crotch . Grease and Shok knew Lynch 's cousin from prison , and he got them an intro to the athlete . MeUndies announced it would donate $ 20,000 to Lynch 's charity to cover the fine plus $ 20,000 for every touchdown he scored at the big game . They ended up spending $ 40,000 total -- a pittance for Super Bowl exposure . `` Those two campaigns , '' says Shokrian , `` put us on the map . '' SHOK / MeUndies HQ November 3 , 2014 , after 202 days inside , Shokrian walked out of Terminal Island , released five months early . His entire family was there to greet him . They gave him his cellphone , which had been off since April 15 , and took him home , where he changed out of his prison sweats and had breakfast with some old buddies . A few days later , he was back at work . The transition was easy , he says . Shokrian had stayed connected to everyone while locked up and even shared his journals with some of them , so there was n't much catching up to do . But he did carry a new lesson with him , hard-learned from the asbestos fiasco : He needed to think through decisions more carefully and get good expertise . `` It 's on me to do the diligence and to slow down , '' he says . `` Now I go into everything asking as many questions as I can , so I feel confident in the decision we 're making . '' This would filter into MeUndies at large . `` It was n't like Moses came down and gave us the new values of the company , '' says Taubman . But employees did notice a subtle shift . During MeUndies ' first years , Shokrian myopically followed competitors into sexy marketing and a lot of unoriginal branding . Now , says Taubman , Shokrian started thinking differently : `` We ca n't just be another brand that does the same thing , that has the same photo shoot , that pays the same influencers . It was like he was given the thumbs-up to do things another way . It was very slight but powerful . '' Shortly after Shokrian got out of prison , MeUndies partnered with the edgy digital media platform Arsenic -- but when he saw the sexual content it was planning , he pulled out of the deal . From then on , MeUndies stopped going for the quick clicks . The company came out in support of the LGBTQ community and partnered with restaurateur Eddie Huang , who stood in front of the camera in just his MeUndies and talked about body insecurity among Asian men . In August 2019 , the brand launched Feel Free , a range of larger sizes -- and then , `` because maybe even they wo n't fit , and someone will be left out , '' Shokrian says , they added a button for people who need more room . The button makes no financial sense , but it 's a show of commitment to inclusion . The formula seems to be working . In January 2019 , Shokrian took back his role as CEO and has grown the company to 250 employees . It anticipates $ 100 million in sales for 2020 . MeUndies ' model also seems to be paying off . The underwear-and-socks category overall has n't grown in the past year , but the shift to online purchases is profound -- an increase in the U.S. of 9 percent , to $ 5.2 billion , during the year ending September 2019 , according to The NPD Group . And MeUndies is moving offline , too . In November , it opened its second brick-and-mortar store -- this one in the Del Amo Fashion Center , which is owned by Simon Property Group , the real estate giant whose venture arm invested in MeUndies . -LRB- It has raised almost $ 11 million . -RRB- `` So there is definitely a very big strategic partnership there as we look to expand and open more stores , '' says Shokrian . GREASE / On the Outside When Shokrian left Terminal Island , he gave Nickson a note that said : Always stay positive and evolve , learn , and grow . `` That shit was so profound , '' says Nickson now . The two men talked often in the years that followed . Then , on July 15 , 2019 , after 17 years in prison , Nickson was released . He breathed in the fresh air , and a lady friend picked him up from the facility . A job was waiting for him at MeUndies . He 'd learn the product in the warehouse and then move into a marketing role . But it 's not so easy , both men say , to walk away from a criminal past . For Shokrian , having a record as a convicted felon has meant often explaining the case to new acquaintances or potential partners . `` That has definitely impacted me and our business , '' he says . And for Nickson , it 's meant that every part of his new life is an adjustment -- and the structured environment at MeUndies , it turned out , just was n't an easy fit . Less than five months after Nickson joined the company , they parted ways . No hard feelings . `` That 's my friend forever , '' explains Nickson . `` I 've got a lot of love for him , '' says Shokrian . Both , in fact , look forward to the next chapter of the story that is still unfolding . `` From the Jonathans to the -- I mean , the way we met and the friendship that spun from it , '' says Nickson . `` They have a saying that we make plans and God laughs . This is my destiny . '' Another friend of his from Terminal Island , Vincent Bragg , had seen how Nickson 's ideas helped MeUndies -- so when Bragg got out in 2016 , he cofounded ConCreates , a marketing agency that crowdsources ideas from people currently incarcerated or affected by the system . To whatever extent good marketing is essentially a con job , there 's a voracious thirst for erupting originality , and ConCreates has already secured a partnership with global agency 72andSunny . Now Nickson works with them , too . Shokrian , meanwhile , is grateful for the perspective he found in prison -- one that , he believes , will continue to shape his company in the future . `` Although I wish it did n't happen , '' he says , `` it 's not something I would want to take back . Considering no one got hurt , I 'm grateful for the tough lessons it gave me . There 's still an opportunity , no matter who you are , to turn a negative into a positive .

You want to be cool enough and warm enough to get through the night without waking up . Then again , there 's the issue of sweat . If you wear pajamas , you only have to wash those pajamas . Sleeping in the nude means you have to wash your sheets more often , does n't it ? The survey also found that 24 % of pajama-wearers admit to being afraid of accidentally being seen naked .

We will not discuss methods of improving conditions -LRB- or preventing the worsening of conditions -RRB- within a maze , beyond a brief note on what a CEO might do . For a middle manager anything beyond not making the problem worse is exceedingly difficult . Even for the CEO this is an extraordinarily difficult task . To rescue society as a whole requires collectively fighting back . We will consider such options in later posts . For now , the problem statement is hard enough . To reiterate the main personal-level takeaway Being in a maze is not worth it . They could n't pay you enough . Even if they could , they definitely do n't . If you end up CEO , you still lose . These lives are not worth it . Do not be a middle manager at a major corporation or other organization that works like this . Do not sell your soul . Problem statement Increasingly , avoiding mazes is easier said than done . First , one must identify them , for which the previous post offers a guide . After that , there are still many hard problems to solve . How do we avoid moral mazes ? How do we justify that choice to others ? What alternative choices do we have ? What if we 're already in a maze ? What if we 've already self-modified in ways that make it hard to extract ourselves ? What if our human or social capital only pays off inside them ? What about if you are doing object-level work without anyone who reports to you , but you have a maze above you ? And for those who think this way , do I have a moral obligation to suffer and do this anyway , in order to maximize my charitable giving , or to otherwise do good ? How do we avoid immoral mazes ? Truly understand how painful it will be to interact with a maze even if you 're not an employee . Know the signs , as discussed in the previous post . Keep a close eye out for mazes . Realize that you have other options . Choose other paths . This is n't an ` all things being equal ' choose other paths . This is making what look like major sacrifices and different life choices and profession choices , or taking big risks -LRB- that may or may not include starting a business or doing work outside of an organization -RRB- in order to have skin in the game . Really understand that the offer from even a relatively tolerable maze is much , much worse than it looks , and that opportunities outside mazes are often much better and more realistic than they look . Young people starting out in the labor market often have The Fear that they will never find a job or never find a good job or another good job . If you are capable of getting this far , and you persevere , that is not true for you . A wide variety of jobs and other opportunities are out there . I realize some people have already become so trapped in mazes that they can not walk away . If you actually ca n't walk away , see the last two questions . What do you do if you find yourself inside a maze ? Quit . Seriously . Go do something else . Ideally , do it today . At least start planning and looking . Every day there is another day you suffer , another day you invest your social and human capital in ways that ca n't be transferred , and another day you become infected by the maze that much more . If you actually ca n't afford to quit , see the last three questions . How do we justify our choice to others ? When I worked for a financial firm , the question ` what do you do ? ' -LRB- or , in a scarier form , ` who are you ? ' as implicitly defined by your job -RRB- had an easy answer . I work for -LRB- firm -RRB- . One of the big benefits was being able to tell an easy , compact story of me and my life and work choices , that most found praiseworthy . It was easy . It was comfortable . It also worked wonders for things like renting an apartment or otherwise proving myself respectable . A lot of the alternative answers that do n't involve mazes give you a much better life and method of earning a living , but they do make answering the ` what do you do ? ' and ` how can I count on you to make rent or support a family ? ' questions trickier . One must acknowledge this . It is n't only strangers you tell this story to . It is your friends . It is your family . It is also yourself . I likely stayed at -LRB- firm -RRB- months longer than I should have due to being scared of not being able to tell this story anymore , especially to my wife and to myself , and having to instead tell a different one . A lot of this fear is the expectation that others wo n't understand and wo n't accept our justifications . That does happen , but far less than people typically expect or fear . Most people are far more sympathetic than the inside view might suggest . Even the internet is supportive . Which is not its style . This is largely because , at least for now , there is a widespread cultural belief that one should do what you love , and be content in one 's work . That work should provide meaning . That 's not always a good rule or good idea , although it is a fine aspiration . Not everyone can have soul in the game . But almost everyone recognizes that it would be better if one did . How do you go about telling your new story ? -LRB- Justification continued -RRB- Here 's my take on how to approach this , based on my experience . Comments suggesting improvements or alternatives are highly encouraged . There are two parts of this . One is to figure out what you are doing , not only what you 're not doing , and how to talk about that . Some of those answers are mostly culturally normal and comfortable , some of them are less so . Now that I can say ` I 'm a game designer ' that goes over quite well . The most important things here are to make the thing you are doing sound simple , put it in terms that people can relate to , and to make it clear that you are comfortable and happy with it to the extent that this would n't be lying to people . If you 're not comfortable and happy with it , people will pounce on that . It 's also much better to be happy with what you are doing for your own sake , so that is something to work on , either looking to get to that place , or to finding another option where you can do that . If you quit today without a plan , then what you will be doing is recovering from your experience and figuring out what to do next . I told that story for about a month . That story goes over better than you would expect -- for a while . From a social -LRB- as well as financial -RRB- perspective you are most definitely on a clock . There are plenty of people who let that clock run out . But if it 's two weeks in , own it . The other part of your explanation is justifying why you 're not doing the standard thing of indenturing yourself to a new maze , unless you have an obviously great alternative thing going . The worse your answer to part one sounds , the harder part two is going to be . First try giving it to them straight . Tell them you find large corporations highly toxic and morally compromising . It left you a wreck . You have no interest in the lifestyle you would live or the person that you would be . If they are genuinely curious , you can point them to Moral Mazes itself or this series of posts , or explain further in your own words . You can also use the culturally assigned incantations to explain your decision . Tell people you need to do what you are passionate about , to ` follow your heart/passion , ' to do what you believe in , to ` help people ' or ` make a difference . ' To ` get your hands dirty ' and ` do something real . ' Some people appreciate wanting to ` be your own boss ' or ` do it your way , ' which are weaker , non-dystopian ways of sending the real message . And of course , you can simply say ` it was making me miserable . I hated it . Doing this instead makes me happy . ' I 've gotten into the habit of saying my job at -LRB- firm -RRB- was ` a poor fit ' because I genuinely believe both that there were particular real needs they have that were expensive for me to provide , and that the firm was in many ways unusually great and unusually low on maze characteristics , and I do not think it is a mistake to take a job there if it would suit you . They treated me right and I do n't want to throw anyone under the bus . You could also , if you wanted to , use the question as an opportunity to do a public service and spread the word . That 's supererogatory . Another thing to keep in mind , as discussed in the next question , is that those pushing us towards mazes are often operating on traditions and heuristics that used to push towards virtuous action that led to happiness and real success . The world changed , and those traditions and heuristics started getting this wrong . This is highly sympathetic . It might help to approach from this perspective . Most people get it . They do n't fully get it unless they 've been on in the inside and reflected upon what happened . But they do get that there 's something soul-killing about working for the man and/or being lost in a maze of political actions . Others wo n't get it . What if my family or culture wo n't accept my justifications ? Some people wo n't get it . They will respond that all of this is excuses for not wanting to do hard work or make sacrifices . That this is how the ` real world ' works . That it is ` time to grow up . ' That a ` real adult/man/woman / hero/whomever ' would suck it up and deal with it . That it is your responsibility to do so , for your family , for the world or for yourself . That ` get a steady job ' is what good and responsible people do . That this is how one survives in today 's world , and how one gets to raise and support a family . Often people who are counting on you , usually family members , will effectively let you know that while they care a non-zero amount about whether your life experience is miserable , or what impact your work has on the world , or what upside or opportunities for personal growth you might have , what they actually care about is whether you are projecting the illusion of security . They want to mentally cache that you/they ` are going to be OK ' and that ` everything is all right . ' This has remarkably little to do with actual security . Jobs in many mazes are not especially secure . Others are secure barring disruption of the underlying order , if you are willing to pay the prices discussed , and tie all your human and social capital to the maze . The security they seek is the security of the banker who loses money when everyone around him loses money . This is useful to the banker because one can not then scapegoat and fire him if he has bad luck and does poorly . This is useful to those in a maze and those who tie their fates to them , because they hope they will similarly seem responsible and legitimate , and thus worthy of sympathy and assistance if things go poorly . It is a self-reinforcing charade . People demand this illusion of legitimacy to protect against others ' accusations of illegitimacy . They will defend this charade even if times change , the mazes mostly fail and those who are doing real things succeed , and attempt to forcibly transfer wealth from people doing real things to those who previously worked in mazes . All of that does n't make participation in the charade worthless . You can even hope to benefit from the expropriations . But it is important to know that it is a charade . If you face a family and/or culture that demands devotion of one 's entire life to the illusion of respectability , have sympathy for those making these demands . In the past , when these traditions and heuristics developed , the illusion of respectability corresponded to real work and other worthy virtues that lead to happiness and true success . If they fail to realize the change , and update accordingly , that is at least somewhat understandable . If attempts to make them realize this change or accept your perspective fail , one must treat them the same way one treats anything else that is out to get you . If their demands can not be satisfied in a way you can accept , because they will simply demand more until it is something you can not accept , then attempting to satisfy their demands is folly . If you previously chose those around you based upon being a member of a maze , then it is plausible that having invested in those people and relationships it makes sense to stick around . It is also plausible that being around them afterwards no longer makes sense . I know it is easy to say and tough to act upon , but hopefully in time either they will understand and/or come around , or you will realize that life is better without them . What if you 've already self-modified too much ? This sucks quite a lot . After a while , those little status differences and little battles start to deeply matter . Other things matter less and less . Humans can adapt to many things . Giving up all that likely fills you with deep existential dread . Even worse , you 've sculpted everything else , including your friends and often your family , around these obsessions . You , and often they , depend on the currently steady money and the illusion of security the maze provides . Without that , things could rapidly fall apart . The good news is , you 've figured out that this happened . Perhaps you have n't self-modified as much as you 've feared , or you have a path back to undoing this . Often the modifications start reverting once you extract yourself from the situation . Often you 're deeply miserable , in a way that those around you at least subconsciously know quite well . Those around you often realize this long before the person realizes it about themselves . If you tell the people you care about what 's really going on , if they 're worth keeping , they 'll almost always be supportive . I 've seen a number of people realize they hated their jobs and needed to go . Almost all of them got lots of support when they got the courage to say it out loud . A note I got on a previous draft : `` The happiest Uber drivers I have seen used to be middle management . '' If anything , I see many people around me being too supportive of opting out of working , or in a sense out of life , entirely . It is important to help and encourage people to do more things . See the question above on how to explain your choices and situation to others . So my first suggestion is to admit to yourself what is happening to you . Take an inventory . Concretely observe what is actually going on around you , without excuses or euphemisms , and what that is doing to your brain and your life . Then tell the people who care about you . And go from there . Are mazes are where our human and/or social capital pays off ? Note that when I say ` pays off ' here , I mean maximally pays off . If you have the skills and opportunity to advance inside a maze , you have the skills and opportunity to take a lower level position at a smaller institution , and still earn a reasonable living . That does not mean that this transition would not be painful , or that you could maintain your current lifestyle , or that your family and friends would stand by you , but you definitely have that option . If you are an academic with a PhD , and notice your academic institution is a maze , keep in mind that the entire concern about you only getting paid off in academia probably simply is n't true . Academics typically get substantial pay bumps when they move to private industry . A lot of other professionals are similarly buying the security and familiarity of what they 're used to , rather than being paid off with dollars . One must still be careful to ensure not to jump from one maze into another . Then there 's big corporations . Big corporations really do pay better than smaller businesses if you ca n't get equity in either business . The recent history of domestic ` income inequality ' is in large part inequality between firms as bigger and more successful firms pay higher salaries even to their lower tiers , and have more higher tiers in which to earn yet more . There are three theories I know about for why big corporations pay more . Theory one is that big corporations are more likely to have O-ring production functions or otherwise benefit more from higher quality workers , so they pay more in order to attract better workers . Theory two is that big corporations make more money per employee , and are big enough to potentially support unions , so employees demand and receive more of that pay . Theory three is that working in a big corporation sucks , and employees realize this to at least some extent , so employees demand more money in order to be willing to work there . If working at a major corporation is a major life cost , and working in management a bigger one , and these come with higher pay , than a lot of income inequality in developed countries does not represent a gap in desired life outcomes , and it might be more unfair if that part of the gap was closed . A lot more of that pay gap is that some professions engage in rent seeking behavior to extract resources . Some big examples are finance , law , education/academia , and medicine . Again , that comes with much better pay . It also usually comes with a big time investment in the development of the relevant social capital , human capital and credentials you need to succeed . If you went to medical school or law school or worked hard to get a tenure track , and later realize that your profession is a maze -LRB- I 'm making no claim here that these professions are or are n't mazes in general or how intense those mazes might be , although some central organizations within them clearly are very intense mazes -RRB- , walking away from that is going to be expensive . This is doubly true for human capital within a single organization . When I took a job at a financial firm , they spent a large part of my first two years training me . The first year had a lot of firm-specific detail but was mostly training about markets and trading in general , that applies everywhere there are markets . It was fascinating , and pretty great . Five stars , would study again , especially given they paid me rather than the other way around . The second year still had a lot of training and learning , but increasingly it was about the specific problems I was working on , developing relationships with and learning about coworkers and organizational structures and how we did things , and other information specific to the firm . This was less fun , and when I left , it became worthless . I had another job I stayed in for five years . This was also a place I got to observe transition from mostly not being a maze into becoming one over time , although that 's a story I ca n't tell online . Early on there was a lot of learning , a lot of which was very specific to our business , but a lot of which applies universally . I worked mainly with one particular person , who knew what we were doing and cared about us doing it well . It provided great experience . By the third year , I was learning about our specific products and customers and dynamics , in increasingly arcane fashion . I was also forced to interact increasingly with the maze growing around us , spending more time making bosses and others like what they saw rather than doing what was right for the business . I was unable to get the resources to enhance our performance , despite yearly returns on investment obviously well above 100 % . I made an effort to switch over into problems that were both more valuable and offered more room for growth , both for me and for the business , and which I could tackle with the resources available . By the fifth year , I was n't developing any skills that would be useful elsewhere , except that I was now learning to code because I got tired of no one being able to code what I needed . This brought me from ` can code but not in an actually useful way ' to ` can code real things that are useful , but badly/slowly . ' Note that the managers in Moral Mazes who succeed were always moving around to bigger and better things . If they were n't , they instead moved on to similar and different thus hard to compare things to preserve the illusion of career momentum . If you have adopted the maze nature , many of the skills you have learned doing so translate to other mazes . Your existing within-maze status can often also be transferred to your new location , but only if you continue to be seen as a winner . If you 're a loser , no one else will want you , and moving on will mean moving down . That means that once your path in the maze is stalled , even though you have invested a lot to get to this point , recovering your momentum is going to be extremely difficult . If you are not satisfied with your current role , your human capital is a lot less valuable than it naively appears to be , because it no longer has much upside even on its own terms . The fall from where you are to starting over can still be large . The best feature of an academic maze is that they have a perfectly designed system in which to not care about getting ahead , which The Gervais Principle calls a loser , and which academia calls tenure . The pattern remains . The more you dedicate time to a path , both a profession and a particular job , the more you give up when you leave and the less of your time you can carry with you . Many people do n't have great options . The job market is n't that great out there if you do n't want to be coding and do n't have an in with the rent seekers , and ca n't use the skills you 've developed , or do the thing that legibly follows from your resume . If mazes are where my social and/or human capital pays off , what should I do ? Let us ignore here why your capital pays off best in a maze . It does not much matter to your decision , in important senses , to what extent rent seeking , theft , coercion , fraud or even systems designed explicitly to make your skills not transfer to honest work are or are n't responsible for this being the case . For whatever reason , often events conspire to prevent you from efficiently plying your trade -LRB- or in some cases , plying it at all -RRB- , where you hold comparative advantage , without being part of a maze . Some people really do have a dilemma , where they can either do something menial and mindless that still gets them abused and does n't pay much , if they can find work at all . Or they can go out on a limb that looks super risky and likely to fail , and/or that requires years without compensation . Or they can keep working in the maze . It is important that vastly more people think they are in this position , than are in this position . If you think you are in this position , consider the possibility that you are mistaken . Consider all the alternatives . Consider how much the reduction in medium-term funds and superficial status would actually matter to you . Consider how much of what 's holding you back is simply The Fear in some form . Imagine exactly how relieved you 'd be to be out of there . Remember that even if leaving really is super painful , involving a large reduction in consumption levels and superficial status and standard of living , and the abandonment of large sunk costs , that does n't mean it is n't Worth It . My first line of response to this dilemma is exactly what you would expect : Consider leaving anyway . But I admit that is n't always the right answer . In some cases , things really have gone too far , you have too many promises to keep and too many sunk costs . Become a Loser The next line of defense is to become a loser , in the sense laid out in The Gervais Principle . A loser does not strive to get ahead while at work . A loser finds their value in other places than work . At work , they pride themselves on putting forward at most the minimum amount of effort to get the job done . The Gervais Principle can be seen as the prequel to Moral Mazes , dealing with life at lower levels of mazes that have to interact with the real world . Mazes need , as several quotes describe , people who keep their heads down and ` do their job ' with no ambitions for further advancement . Ideally one does this as low on the totem pole as one can stomach and afford , as the life that results is far less odious and taxing . By declaring themselves as neutral and not a threat , such people are often left mostly alone if they 're important to the system continuing to run . They can now reclaim some slack and a personal life . It 's not a great solution . You 're still holding up the maze . You 're still interacting with it . You 'll still have to make severe moral sacrifices . But to some extent , some of the time , you can pick and choose what to have no part in . Over time , your position likely will slowly degrade . Eventually this may lead you to leave . Hopefully by then you 'll have been able to save enough and be prepared enough to be ready for that . If you 're stuck in a maze , the least you can do is turn a healthy monthly profit . Take Risks The final line of defense I can come up with is to take big bold risks . Either stand up for what you believe in or gamble to advance your own situation . Sometimes this will work , your situation will improve and you 'll learn your situation was better than you thought . Other times they 'll backfire , and you 'll learn your situation was worse than you thought and is now worse than that . Remember that if you get fired from a job you do n't want , that can be a big win , because you might not have had the courage to leave on your own and you might even get severance and unemployment . The real danger is often not that you get fired . It 's that you become ` dead without knowing it ' as in this quote : You can put the damper on anyone who works for you very easily and that 's why there 's too much chemistry in the corporation . There 's not enough objective information about people . When you really want to do somebody in , you just say , well , he ca n't get along with people . That 's a big one . And we do that constantly . What that means , by the way , is that he pissed me off ; he gave evidence of his frustration with some situation . Another big one is that he ca n't manage -- he does n't delegate or he does n't make his subordinates keep his commitments . So in this sort of way , a consensus does build up about a person and a guy can be dead and not even know it . -LRB- Location 1475 , Quote 10 -RRB- This can lead you to waste years of your life struggling for something you had no chance of getting . This is one reason why a great way to take risk is to force the issue , asking for or demanding raises or promotions . It avoids this danger . The more uncertain you are about where you stand , the more you should take risk to create clarity . At all my jobs in mazes , I would have greatly benefited from taking greater risks to create clarity , regardless of the outcome . Can You Change Things From the Top ? If you by some miracle reach the top with your soul intact , now you can try and change the system . Or at least you can do harm reduction in earnest . One should n't give this much hope or weight , since such intentions rarely survive that long , and doing anything lasting about it will still be quite hard . I do n't know what would work . My friends and I have talked to several people who have reached the top . Many of them understand what the process has done to them , but do n't know how to fix themselves or the system . It is n't cheap or easy to reverse or even halt the damage . It is unlikely you can have much impact without reaching the actual top and becoming CEO . If you do become CEO , you may have a short window in which you can ` clean house ' the way that maze CEOs do , and put people opposed to mazes into key positions where they can clean their houses in turn . You can then combine that with other efforts , and maybe get somewhere , but I do n't have the insights necessary to say much more , and such efforts will be exceedingly difficult . The maze will fight back . I strongly believe it is much easier to build a new system from scratch than to ` change the system from within . ' What about if you are doing object-level work without anyone who reports to you , but you have a maze above you ? In Moral Mazes such workers are said to be ` on the line . ' Details of this situation will determine to what extent this represents being stuck in the maze , versus to what extent this represents doing regular object-level work . What are you actually doing all day ? What are your incentives ? If your essential scenario is given an object-level job to do and do it , that is mostly fine . If your essential scenario is not that , it is less fine , but it is still far better than being a middle manager . It 's not good to have a bull **** job , but it 's not the nightmare we 're describing elsewhere . Consider the car salesmen from Imperfect Competition . One can imagine a car dealership as no different from the local hardware store , buying useful tools wholesale and selling them at a higher price to customers who want to buy and use those tools , and the only difference is that you sell 0.1 % as many tools for a thousand times the price . One can also imagine that the demands of the car corporation , and the incentives they provide , and the misinformation they spread , and the regulations they twist and engineer , and so forth , end up with you effectively stuck in the maze . The truth is presumably somewhere in between -- you see insane things around quotas and regulations and advertising campaigns you can not control , and the dealerships have their own issues of their own design , but you are still mostly working for a small actual business most of the time . The same would go for the workers in The Office , as analyzed in The Gervais Principle . Michael is largely in maze hell . Jim spends a lot of time avoiding maze hell . Most of the workers have to deal with the craziness and what it does to the business , but this is only ordinary soul crushing and not what middle managers deal with . Jim 's situation on The Office is the biggest problem . There is no future . The only way up , to better your work situation , would be to dive into the maze . If you do that while not buying into the system , it will go badly for you on all levels . If you do buy in , then you 've fully made the big mistake I 'm warning against . Consider the Uber drivers , some of whom are reported to be happy refugees from middle management . To the extent that the driver is offered rides , chooses to accept them individually , and gets paid for each ride provided , the driver is good . They set their hours and level of effort . There is word that Uber and its ilk are now using algorithmic systems and various overall incentives to try and ensnare their drivers more broadly into the system , which would be worse , but the core experience is still one of real work . Consider a software engineer , given specific tasks to code and coding them . That seems likely to be mostly fine . Consider a worker that is literally ` on the line ' in a manufacturing plant that makes physical objects . It is not the best or most compensated work , but you are mostly free from the maze . Being ` on the line ' and continuing to do real work is miles behind doing real work where you have skin in the game , but if you get to dodge the worst of all this , it is a reasonable temporary fallback if you lack alternatives . Look carefully at details . If you are a manager but not a middle manager -LRB- e.g. no one who reports to you has anyone who reports to them -RRB- , and the group of people you manage has object-level tasks to do together , you are n't automatically doomed , but there is great danger lurking , including the risk you will be promoted . Do I have a moral obligation to work in mazes to maximize my charitable giving ? No . You do n't . This post has done its best to deliberately ignore the moral costs of participating in mazes , because avoiding them is already over-determined without that . I want to make it clear that I 'm not relying on moral concerns . But if that 's what you are concerned about , moral concerns work in the opposite direction . Making the world more and more maze-like by embracing the system , and engaging in zero-sum competitions to extract resources , while making your life miserable , is the opposite of a moral obligation . It may help to remember that a drowning child is hard to find . Moral systems that imply that subjecting oneself to torture in the service of immoral mazes or other harmful systems , for the purposes of allowing other such systems to then extract those resources from you , is a moral obligation , are not likely to be good ideas , or to have your or humanity 's best interests at heart .", "url": "https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/a8wjKNSGCPSzdWMMa/how-escape-from-immoral-mazes", "kws": ["immoral^^mazes", "moral^^mazes", "avoiding^^mazes", "powerful^^mazes", "maze^^hell", "maze^^characteristics", "maze^^CEOs", "severe^^moral^^sacrifices", "people", "coercion", "deep^^existential^^dread", "oneself", "insane^^things", "Justification", "Moral^^systems", "real^^things", "political^^actions", "behavior", "moral^^concerns", "virtuous^^action"], "text_category": {}}

An unidentified woman was recently filmed wandering through Miami International Airport in video footage that hit social media on Wednesday , strolling through the air hub in a bra and panties before stripping off the underwear altogether . After police responded , the nude woman somehow managed to climb on top of a patrol car as it left the airport , leap off the vehicle and run through moving traffic towards another police officer . The 27-year-old woman has since been taken into custody for a mental health evaluation , a spokesperson for the Miami-Dade Police Department told Fox News . The incident happened on Monday at around 11:40 p.m. . The barefoot traveler sauntered through the baggage claim area of the Florida air hub , singing while she removed her navy blue bra and underwear , the Miami Herald reported . In a 30-second clip shared to Twitter by filmmaker Billy Corben , the woman was seen strolling past several shocked onlookers . By the end of the video , she 's totally nude . `` Because Miami , '' Corben captioned the clip . A second video shared to Twitter shows what happened after the woman was escorted out of the airport , according to CBS Miami . In it , the naked woman appears to have hopped onto the roof of a police vehicle . She then leaps off of the car and runs through traffic toward another police officer , standing outside of his parked car . After being observed acting `` erratically , '' the woman was taken into custody for an involuntary mental health evaluation under the Florida Baker Act statute , the Miami-Dade Police Department told Fox News . According to CBS Miami , the woman is reportedly from outside of the state . Law enforcement officials described her as `` incoherent '' and `` delusional '' when they spoke to her . Because the woman was taken in for a psychological evaluation , police said charges are not expected to be filed .

Shok -- as the founder of MeUndies had become known in federal prison -- shook himself awake , pissed . The 29-year-old from Beverly Hills had gotten used to sleeping in a cell , but actual sleep was sometimes hard to come by , given that his bed was across the hall from the `` black TV room '' -LRB- as everyone called it -RRB- . Guys could get noisy in there . And on this morning , as the halls of the prison were still largely quiet , they were having a heated conversation about politics with the door wide open . So , scrawny as Shok had become behind bars , he got out of bed determined to shut their door -- even if it led to a confrontation . What he found , in the middle of that room , was an intimidating dude named Grease , who could n't have been less happy to see him -- and who , to both of their great surprise , would help define a new direction for MeUndies . But at that moment , nobody was talking business . The question was which one of them would end up on a stretcher . And really , it was n't much of a question . Where to start . SHOK / Zip Code 90210 In early 1985 , Jonathan Shokrian was born into a clutch of Persian Jews in Beverly Hills . Most had fled the 1979 revolution when Iran became Islamic , figuring they 'd go back when it all blew over . But Shokrian grew up sensing the struggle of a community that realized they were stuck here . `` There was a big identity crisis between the old world that our parents came from and this new world that we were living in , '' he says . `` I was told how I had to dress , who I could date . I was forced to take Farsi classes and groomed into taking over the family business . '' He had n't even graduated college at Southern Methodist University in Texas when he started working for his dad 's real estate company . But Shokrian found that business cutthroat and impersonal . At the same time , he compared himself to his childhood friends , who were doing amazing things . Escaping like a heady steam from their tiny pressure cooker of a Persian Jewish community , they 'd been launching some of the buzziest startups of the moment -- companies like FabFitFun , Alfred Coffee , and Sweetgreen . Shokrian could feel the intensity of their entrepreneurialism ; it pushed them not only to be part of this American culture but to define it . `` I had never been more excited by anything , '' he says . `` I started obsessively thinking about what my own thing could be . '' In 2011 , Shokrian was packing for a European vacation with Sweetgreen 's cofounder Jonathan Neman and ran to Macy 's to pick up a pair of underwear . There in Dallas 's Northpark mall , he was embarrassed to have to ask a female employee where the men 's underwear was . -LRB- `` I know it sounds silly , '' he says . -RRB- Then he dropped nearly $ 30 for a pair of Calvin Kleins that turned out to be a bad fit . On the trip , he vented about it . `` We were jetlagged , drinking coffee in a caf\u00e9 in Amsterdam , and Jon 's like , ` Someone should make underwear better and sell it online , ' '' says Neman . `` And then literally right there , he logs on to the internet and finds the guy who had UnderwearClub.com and offers him , like , $ 5,000 for the URL . That 's how Jon works . '' That deal fell through , and anyway , as they traveled , Shokrian decided that the name of his nascent underwear company should have more attitude . `` I personally struggled with body image and confidence , '' he says , `` and every ad I saw out there was so alienating , like you had to have a six-pack or wings on your back . '' He wanted to build a company that made everyone feel good in their skivvies , which meant the messaging had to be as comfortable as the fabric . He liked the cheeky way the English called their intimates `` undies , '' and because at the core the company would be about self-expression , Shokrian stuck the `` me '' in front . And there it was : MeUndies . Back home in L.A. , he found a student designer on Craigslist to sketch out prototypes . Then he set out to raise money . He 'd previously invested in his friends ' startups , so they now returned the favor . He also took money from a new incubator called Science , which was helping to build some of the biggest direct-to-consumer , subscription-based companies . Dollar Shave Club was starting there . So was DogVacay . Shokrian wanted MeUndies to run on a subscription model as well , which in theory would create recurring revenue while saving his customers from awkward trips to Macy 's . `` When Jonathan showed me his artwork , '' says Science cofounder Mike Jones , former CEO of MySpace , `` it was like this beautiful blend of a non-gender-conformity-building , modern , fresh approach . It felt like the anti -- Victoria 's Secret , the anti-Jockey . And that felt very next-generation . '' But Shokrian would n't be the star of Science . That honor went to Dollar Shave Club , which quickly exploded in popularity -LRB- and would later sell for $ 1 billion -RRB- . At MeUndies , six months after launching in December 2011 , Shokrian 's team of three was cramped in his father 's office , out of cash and pretty much out of inventory . He considered quitting but decided to give it one last shot , taking a loan from his dad to buy more product . That tided them over into the holidays and led MeUndies to its first $ 100,000 month . And on that momentum , Shokrian went on another fundraising tour and found some interest . `` The basics market was just stale , '' says Tyler Winklevoss , who 'd become an investor , `` and did n't speak to the modern consumer either in sensibility or purchasing channel . It was ready for a fresh newcomer . '' Shokrian raised $ 1 million and moved MeUndies into its own warehouse . As he relentlessly pushed to sell product , his tactics were sometimes at odds with his ambition to build a body-positive brand . `` Every major brand at the time used some form of sexualized content in order to drive attention , '' he says . `` In the early days , that 's all I knew . '' And so MeUndies hired seductive models to flaunt its underwear and even launched its socks on a new high-end porn site . `` Some of our early campaigns I 'm really proud of and others , you know , I 'm not , '' he admits . Say what you will , and people said a lot , the strategy tripled revenues . By 2013 , the team -- now around 10 strong -- was relieved to be over the hump . `` And then EPA agents showed up at my door , '' says Shokrian . `` They told me they were prosecuting me . '' GREASE / South Central L.A. . While Shokrian was growing up in one of the world 's fanciest neighborhoods , a boy named Joe Nickson was coming of age in South Central L.A. , infamous for gangs like the Neighborhood Crips and the Bloods , and crack . Nickson 's father managed logistics for a security company ; his mother worked as a home nurse . They split up when Nickson was about 6 but sent their son -- their only child together -- to school in suburban San Fernando Valley to keep him out of trouble . Nickson loved his classes but felt torn between two realities . `` I would go to different sleepovers , have different vernaculars , '' he says . `` I would hear about Tony Hawk in elementary school and when I went back home , the new Eazy-E and Snoop Dogg albums . I could relate to both worlds , but I never felt that I belonged to either . So in my adolescent years , I started acting out , just to try to reversely fit in . '' At 16 , he joined the Neighborhood Crips and started `` flocking . '' It worked like this : Nickson , who inherited the street name Grease because he was too slick to get caught , would set out with his crew , dressed like basketball players selling candy , or they 'd put on white shirts with black ties , get some pamphlets , and pretend to be Jehovah 's Witnesses . Then they 'd `` flock '' to wealthy parts of town like migrating birds and knock on doors . If no one was home , they 'd break in . It all ended rather abruptly , he says , when one of the houses they burglarized belonged to a district attorney . The laptop Nickson stole had a tracker in it . Nickson was sent to fire camp , an alternative to prison for first-time offenders . He was there only a few months . On the day he returned back home , a member of the Bloods pulled up in front of him in a Camaro , rolled down the window , and tossed out an envelope . `` When you ready to get some money , come holler at me , '' the man said . The envelope contained $ 5,000 in cash . Nickson hollered and was soon robbing banks . In four months , his crew hit more than 10 . `` We got out of hand , '' he says . But one time really sticks with him : He was masked and armed , heisting a Bank of America on March 12 , 2001 . He 'd already stuffed his long johns with cash and was heading away from a sign that said , of all things : `` Easier Access : What are you waiting for ? '' Then , a kid -- maybe 4 years old -- popped up out of nowhere . `` He runs up to me and he puts his hand like mocking a gun and he says , ` Freeze ! ' '' Nickson recalls . `` And I say , ` Little man , where 's your mommy ? ' And she says , ` I 'm right here . ' '' Nickson grabbed the boy by the hand and brought him to his mother . This was the first time he really thought about the people he victimized . And he said to himself , I 'm not supposed to be doing this . He quit hitting banks , but the police still caught up with him . Nickson was convicted of conspiracy and bank robbery and took a plea on three additional bank robberies . On June 6 , 2005 , he was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison . He was 25 . SHOK / Dallas Shokrian 's run-in with the feds -- the reason the EPA showed up at his door -- went back to a critical mistake he made when he was 23 . Before starting MeUndies , when he was working for his father , he convinced his dad to buy and fix up a huge , run-down 1950s shopping center called Fazio 's . The place was a wreck -- rats , holes in the roof , buckled floor tiles , asbestos allegedly in the glue holding them together . Some forms of asbestos are unregulated and do n't require the full , heavily controlled -LRB- and expensive -RRB- removal process . Shokrian 's construction consultant , according to court records , said the building contained this kind of asbestos . So , eager to make his dad proud and get the place renovated quickly , Shokrian outfitted his workers with masks and respirators , and went about renovations . But the project made news when workers used gasoline to clean the tiles , which caught the attention of the EPA . The agency decided to investigate and determined that the asbestos did need to be removed according to regulations . `` I tried to tell them it was an honest mistake , '' says Shokrian , `` and that I would never intentionally put someone in harm 's way . '' The Shokrians paid a $ 500,000 fine , took asbestos removal training , and started monitoring the workers for health issues . And everybody moved on . Except that , four years later , out of the blue , the case came back . After the agents showed up at Shokrian 's door , he was accused of failure to notify under the Clean Air Act . `` I never thought a judge in his right mind would send me to jail , '' says Shokrian . But that 's what happened . `` This was not a case in which -LSB- Shokrian -RSB- set about to injure the environment , '' Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater said at his sentencing hearing in Dallas . But the law is the law : He sentenced Shokrian to federal prison for a year and a day . The founder of MeUndies had 45 days to self-surrender . `` We were shocked , '' says Neman , the Sweetgreen cofounder , who flew in for support along with others . `` It felt like a final supper . '' GREASE and SHOK / Terminal Island Nickson was 12 years into his sentence and doing time at Terminal Island , in L.A. 's harbor -- transferred to the minimum-security facility for good behavior -- when Jonathan Shokrian showed up there to begin his own imprisonment . It was April 15 , 2014 . Shokrian had left MeUndies in good hands . He 'd chosen a CEO to run the business and had taken his team out to dinner to buoy their spirits . He knew that , as a federal prisoner , he 'd be prohibited from conducting business while incarcerated , but he planned to stay in as close touch as he could . At the office , the MeUndies staff set up a special Golden Eagle Trimstyle phone -- red for drama -- just for when Shokrian called . `` I felt very confident the company would survive my absence , '' he says . His own survival felt less certain . `` I was scared , '' he says . `` I mean , I 'm from this very sheltered Jewish Persian family in Beverly Hills . '' He hired a prison consultant -LRB- an actual thing -RRB- , who prepped him on how to stay out of trouble . And once inside , that 's what Shokrian did . The other inmates started calling him Shok , and he kept focused on journaling daily , reading , and , as soon as he could get sneakers , running 50 miles a week . Shok thought a lot about MeUndies and was frustrated by not being able to contribute more . He could send emails via the prison-monitored CorrLinks and make limited calls , but he had to be careful . `` I was able to make suggestions and get updates , '' he says . `` But there was this very , very fine line I had to walk . '' Shok 's first-ever hire , Noah Taubman , came regularly to the visitors room , with its sad vending machines . `` Jon would always show up with a piece of paper and go , ` How 's this going ? How 's that going ? ' '' says Taubman , senior project manager . `` He would have us print out the MeUndies Instagram feed and mail it to him , then go through it and comment and mail it back . It was surreal to see his complete reversal . He always wanted to control everything , and he had controlled everything . Now he was in an off-white jumpsuit , three sizes too big . His hair was short . He had lost a crap-ton of weight . That was scary . '' But then , one fateful early morning , Shok said , Screw it . He 'd had enough . The TV Room Terminal Island is home to some 1,150 inmates , and , as is common in prison , they tend to divide themselves by race . Shok 's bed was across the hall from a TV room used by black men -- `` like a barbershop , '' as Nickson describes it , where the guys would hang out and converse . And they kept the door open so it would n't get too hot . `` So one day around 7 o'clock , '' Nickson says , `` Mr. Privileged comes in , looks around , and closes the door . '' Mr. Privileged was , of course , Shok . And Nickson -- or Grease to everyone in prison -- reopened the door . From there , the men forget exactly how they nearly came to blows . Grease : `` I already have it in my mind that if he closes -LSB- the door -RSB- again , I 'm going to smash the collarbone off his shoulders . Can you believe what his first words to me are ? ` All I hear is your fucking mouth . ' '' Shok : `` Well , no . He said , ` If you touch the door one more time , you little punk-ass bitch , it 'll be the last door you touch . ' And then I was like , ` I would n't be touching the door if I did n't have to hear your loud-ass mouth . ' '' Grease : `` And as sure as the sun came up , he came in and attempted to -LSB- close the door -RSB- again . '' Shok : `` I forgot where I was . I mean this guy 's like six feet and ripped . I 'm like five nine , a skinny Jewish kid , and he 's about to knock me out . '' Grease : `` I was going to beat the -- oh , yes , I was . And then one of the other guys , said , ` Hey , man , come on . ' '' Shok apologized , and the two ate dinner together that night . `` The connection , '' says Grease , `` was instantaneous . '' After that , they started walking the track , working out , and making special meals together . They talked about life , family , and integrity . If the two had led impossibly different lives , they shared a sense of being torn between worlds . Shok wanted to understand how a guy as smart as Grease was robbing banks . Grease wanted to know everything about MeUndies . `` Grease 's energy was beyond anything I had seen , '' says Shok . `` He was passionate , full of life and ideas , resourceful . He was always laughing . We were very , very close . '' One day Grease came racing from the TV room with news about a Dallas Cowboys running back , telling Shok , `` Joseph Randle just got arrested for stealing underwear from Dillard 's . You have to do something with it . '' Grease had a point ; the player could have just bought underwear online ! It played right into the MeUndies brand story . Back at HQ , the red phone rang . Greg Fass , senior brand manager , picked it up . `` Jon was like , ` We 've got to reach out . We 've got to get involved in the conversation , ' '' he says . So they jumped on it . Adam Schefter , NFL insider at ESPN , was tweeting about how expensive Randle 's stolen underwear was , considering the fine the Cowboys organization was about to slap him with . So using the MeUndies Twitter account , Fass tweeted back : `` @AdamSchefter if you see him , tell Joseph Randle that we 'll pay his fine . We hate buying underwear from dept stores too #DirectToConsumer . '' Schefter responded by putting them in touch with Randle 's people . MeUndies worked out an endorsement deal where it would help cover the $ 29,500 fine in return for Randle doing charitable appearances and donating $ 15,000 in underwear to those in need . Back in prison , Grease and Shok ran to the nearest TV to watch their stunt unfold on the news . `` I had to get him an honorary seat in the black TV room , '' says Grease . Then they saw it , right there on the screen -- Grease 's idea , transported from behind bars and out into the world . It was nothing short of an awakening . `` When I was robbing banks , I was doing it for the adrenaline rush , '' he says . `` This was that feeling times 10 . I thought : This is euphoria . This is what I want to do for the rest of my life . '' The Randle story quickly went viral . In the crush of media , MeUndies got slammed for sponsoring a thief . -LRB- And as it turns out , Randle has gotten in repeated trouble since . -RRB- But Shokrian leaned into the controversy . If MeUndies was under fire , it was also in the spotlight , and the team responded by emphasizing the charitable outcome . `` It really proved to me the power of timing and going live with something that 's socially relevant , '' he says . He also saw Grease 's potential and encouraged him to come up with more ideas for MeUndies . `` Jon told me , ` Bro , you got it , ' '' says Grease . Three months later , Grease spotted another opportunity on the news . With the Super Bowl approaching , Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch was fined for grabbing his crotch . Grease and Shok knew Lynch 's cousin from prison , and he got them an intro to the athlete . MeUndies announced it would donate $ 20,000 to Lynch 's charity to cover the fine plus $ 20,000 for every touchdown he scored at the big game . They ended up spending $ 40,000 total -- a pittance for Super Bowl exposure . `` Those two campaigns , '' says Shokrian , `` put us on the map . '' SHOK / MeUndies HQ November 3 , 2014 , after 202 days inside , Shokrian walked out of Terminal Island , released five months early . His entire family was there to greet him . They gave him his cellphone , which had been off since April 15 , and took him home , where he changed out of his prison sweats and had breakfast with some old buddies . A few days later , he was back at work . The transition was easy , he says . Shokrian had stayed connected to everyone while locked up and even shared his journals with some of them , so there was n't much catching up to do . But he did carry a new lesson with him , hard-learned from the asbestos fiasco : He needed to think through decisions more carefully and get good expertise . `` It 's on me to do the diligence and to slow down , '' he says . `` Now I go into everything asking as many questions as I can , so I feel confident in the decision we 're making . '' This would filter into MeUndies at large . `` It was n't like Moses came down and gave us the new values of the company , '' says Taubman . But employees did notice a subtle shift . During MeUndies ' first years , Shokrian myopically followed competitors into sexy marketing and a lot of unoriginal branding . Now , says Taubman , Shokrian started thinking differently : `` We ca n't just be another brand that does the same thing , that has the same photo shoot , that pays the same influencers . It was like he was given the thumbs-up to do things another way . It was very slight but powerful . '' Shortly after Shokrian got out of prison , MeUndies partnered with the edgy digital media platform Arsenic -- but when he saw the sexual content it was planning , he pulled out of the deal . From then on , MeUndies stopped going for the quick clicks . The company came out in support of the LGBTQ community and partnered with restaurateur Eddie Huang , who stood in front of the camera in just his MeUndies and talked about body insecurity among Asian men . In August 2019 , the brand launched Feel Free , a range of larger sizes -- and then , `` because maybe even they wo n't fit , and someone will be left out , '' Shokrian says , they added a button for people who need more room . The button makes no financial sense , but it 's a show of commitment to inclusion . The formula seems to be working . In January 2019 , Shokrian took back his role as CEO and has grown the company to 250 employees . It anticipates $ 100 million in sales for 2020 . MeUndies ' model also seems to be paying off . The underwear-and-socks category overall has n't grown in the past year , but the shift to online purchases is profound -- an increase in the U.S. of 9 percent , to $ 5.2 billion , during the year ending September 2019 , according to The NPD Group . And MeUndies is moving offline , too . In November , it opened its second brick-and-mortar store -- this one in the Del Amo Fashion Center , which is owned by Simon Property Group , the real estate giant whose venture arm invested in MeUndies . -LRB- It has raised almost $ 11 million . -RRB- `` So there is definitely a very big strategic partnership there as we look to expand and open more stores , '' says Shokrian . GREASE / On the Outside When Shokrian left Terminal Island , he gave Nickson a note that said : Always stay positive and evolve , learn , and grow . `` That shit was so profound , '' says Nickson now . The two men talked often in the years that followed . Then , on July 15 , 2019 , after 17 years in prison , Nickson was released . He breathed in the fresh air , and a lady friend picked him up from the facility . A job was waiting for him at MeUndies . He 'd learn the product in the warehouse and then move into a marketing role . But it 's not so easy , both men say , to walk away from a criminal past . For Shokrian , having a record as a convicted felon has meant often explaining the case to new acquaintances or potential partners . `` That has definitely impacted me and our business , '' he says . And for Nickson , it 's meant that every part of his new life is an adjustment -- and the structured environment at MeUndies , it turned out , just was n't an easy fit . Less than five months after Nickson joined the company , they parted ways . No hard feelings . `` That 's my friend forever , '' explains Nickson . `` I 've got a lot of love for him , '' says Shokrian . Both , in fact , look forward to the next chapter of the story that is still unfolding . `` From the Jonathans to the -- I mean , the way we met and the friendship that spun from it , '' says Nickson . `` They have a saying that we make plans and God laughs . This is my destiny . '' Another friend of his from Terminal Island , Vincent Bragg , had seen how Nickson 's ideas helped MeUndies -- so when Bragg got out in 2016 , he cofounded ConCreates , a marketing agency that crowdsources ideas from people currently incarcerated or affected by the system . To whatever extent good marketing is essentially a con job , there 's a voracious thirst for erupting originality , and ConCreates has already secured a partnership with global agency 72andSunny . Now Nickson works with them , too . Shokrian , meanwhile , is grateful for the perspective he found in prison -- one that , he believes , will continue to shape his company in the future . `` Although I wish it did n't happen , '' he says , `` it 's not something I would want to take back . Considering no one got hurt , I 'm grateful for the tough lessons it gave me . There 's still an opportunity , no matter who you are , to turn a negative into a positive .

's Memorial Coliseum is n't on the field -- it 's just outside the stadium , where a handful of guys are waiting in hopeful anticipation . In the center of the group , eight smiling L.A. Rams cheerleaders are patiently posing for pictures . Of course , they 're decked out in full glam -- hair , makeup , rhinestone crop tops , white go-go boots -- and their fluffy pom-poms only partially obscure their toned abs . Next to the Rams fans , in their oversize jerseys and drapey camo shorts , the women , sparkling there in the California sun , seem as if they 've been airdropped from some more glamorous planet . And if they 're uncomfortable , you would n't know it . This sort of fan meet-and-greet is the de rigueur duty of the modern NFL cheerleader , and they appear inured to the awkwardness of it all . The gaggle of fans , consisting mostly of men , is being shepherded by a small squad of security guards , busily providing instruction about the sorts of poses that are permitted -LRB- arms around shoulders only -RRB- . Absent from these particular pregame festivities are the squad 's two male cheerleaders , Quinton Peron and Napoleon Jinnies , who made history last season when they , along with New Orleans 's Jesse Hernandez , became the league 's first male dancers . Previously , men had performed stunts alongside cheerleaders on some teams , but Peron and Jinnies are dancers , full stop . Their hiring comes at an opportune time , as the idea of an NFL cheerleader is long overdue for a refresh . Over the years , the drudgeries and duties of NFL cheerleaders have been documented : They endure dismal pay and long , difficult hours to pursue a demanding part-time job that 's made to feel , in some ways , like a mere hobby . And the indignities described in a spate of recent lawsuits against the league and its teams suggest even more problematic working conditions . In 2014 , Raiderettes cheerleader Lacy Thibodeaux , after being forced to front the money for team-mandated hair and makeup -- including French manicures and a pricey Rachel McAdam 's -- inspired dye job -- sued the Oakland Raiders for wage theft . She and another cheerleader claimed that the team was breaking labor laws and failing to pay the dancers minimum wage . The two sides reached a settlement that reportedly awarded the women $ 1.25 million -- a good deal more than the $ 7,000 that Thibodeaux otherwise would 've been paid for the entire season 's labor . But meager pay is only the tip of the iceberg . A new documentary that chronicles Thibodeaux 's suit -- and another brought against the Buffalo Jills by Maria Pinzone -- details the sorts of pressures the women face to look the part of an NFL cheerleader . In A Woman 's Work : The NFL 's Cheerleader Problem , Pinzone describes `` jiggle tests , '' which involved doing jumping jacks in front of management in order to show they are fit enough to perform in that weekend 's game . The documentary also highlights the teams ' willingness to put their cheerleaders in vulnerable , uncomfortable positions , especially at events with deep-pocketed sponsors . Yu Gu , the film 's director , recalls footage from a time when the Buffalo Jills worked a golf tournament where they were asked to sit on attendees ' laps , perform in-costume routines , do tricks , and sit in a dunk tank . `` Because #MeToo had n't happened yet , those issues were somewhat sidelined to focus on the fact that they were paid nothing , '' Gu says . Last year , five Washington Redskins cheerleaders told The New York Times about a photo shoot where some women were asked to pose topless or while wearing only body paint , an event the team invited a few sponsors to watch . Afterward , the women allege , the sponsors chose nine of the 36 to be their `` personal escorts '' at a nightclub . In a lawsuit against the Houston Texans , one cheerleader recounted that , after she was attacked by a fan at a game , the team told her to `` suck it up . '' Taken together , the distressing complaints presented in the lawsuits paint a troubling picture for a league that 's already under increased scrutiny for things like long-term brain damage and incidents of domestic violence . So , in the summer of 2018 , representatives from each of the 26 teams that employ cheerleaders convened behind closed doors with NFL execs to discuss some of the issues being surfaced in the suits -- and , according to Vanity Fair , considered ways to make the dancers ' image `` less saucy . '' Since then , the Saints cheerleaders have debuted new uniforms -- they 're now more conservative one-pieces -- and hired Hernandez , their first male dancer . Following the allegation in The New York Times of a topless photo shoot , the Washington Redskins , in tandem with the Indianapolis Colts , have also shifted to less revealing , more `` family-friendly '' uniforms . Gu believes these moves to be flimsy , surface-level attempts by the NFL to skirt any substantive changes to how it treats its ranks of female entertainers . `` If you want to evolve what it means to be a dancer or a cheerleader in the NFL , that needs to be a conversation that includes the workers , '' she says . `` It should n't be ` Oh , here , I 'm just gon na change it . You guys have to wear catsuits now . ' '' Keely Fimbres-Bledsoe has been coaching the Rams cheer team for nearly 30 years now -- including the 20 years the team spent in St. Louis , before it returned to Southern California in 2015 . The move was a happy homecoming for Fimbres-Bledsoe , who was a cheerleader herself through high school and college right here in Los Angeles . During her tenure with the team , she 's worked with hundreds of Rams cheerleaders , and she says she spotted something special in Peron and Jinnies almost immediately . `` Seeing them come through the door and stretch and their technique and their dance ability -- I mean , right away it was amazing , '' Fimbres-Bledsoe tells me . She says the team would have considered men earlier -- auditions had always been open to anyone -- but none showed up until last year . Both Jinnies and Peron knew women who were already with the Rams and were encouraged to try out . But each was surprised to see the other on audition day , having competed against each other on several prior occasions . `` I walked up to him and I was like , ` Hey , since we are the only two boys here , let 's root for the boys . ' And that moment I think solidified our spot , '' Peron says . `` ` If they 're going to take us , they 're going to take us . But I do n't think they can choose between one of us . ' '' Turns out that instinct was right . `` They call my name , and I make this really weird sound , like , ` Aaauuhh , ' '' recalls Jinnies . `` They hand me my shirt , and -LSB- I 'm -RSB- like , ` I did it , ' and there 's just rivers of water coming out of my face . '' The season that followed ended for the Rams at the Super Bowl , making it an improbable rookie year for Jinnies and Peron , who became the first male dancers to perform at the NFL 's grandest game . In the year since , they 've traveled with their teammates , dancing , speaking , doing volunteer work , even visiting troops overseas . When I meet with the two in the Starbucks across from their practice facility , they 've both just recently returned from military visits to Guam and South Korea . Peron , who 's also a dance teacher , says he spent a portion of his time teaching the kids on the base some cheers . `` Some of the dads tried , '' he adds , smiling . For both Peron and Jinnies , arriving at that moment was a long and , at times , painful road . Peron did n't discover his passion for dance until his junior year of high school -- relatively late for someone who 's now a professional athlete . He credits So You Think You Can Dance for inspiring him : Watching tWitch and Will -- black men who looked like him -- perform , he knew he wanted to do that . He quit his basketball team that weekend , infuriating his father , the coach , and started taking classes at a local studio . His parents staunchly opposed his pursuit of dance , in big and small ways -- ragging on him when he wore tights to ballet class , complaining about all-day competitions , and refusing to pay for dance tuition . As a result , Peron , who 's tall and broad-shouldered and frequently flashes a big , warm smile , took classes on scholarship , staying for hours to clean the studio after his friends had gone home . It was n't until he signed with an agent and started collecting paychecks for his choreography work that his parents really came around . Jinnies ' parents , on the other hand , moved mountains to afford for their son the best dance education possible . When he started getting serious about dance in high school , his mom would make the two-hour drive from Santa Barbara to Costa Mesa after a full day of work so that Jinnies could attend class , and then they 'd drive home . They did that twice a week , until he saw his high school dream team perform . He decided to audition , despite knowing that if he made it , he 'd need to live in the school 's district , in Anaheim , which would mean moving out of his parents ' home . By then , Jinnies was already dealing with severe bullying problems due to his sexuality . So when he made the team , he voluntarily packed his things and moved himself down to Orange County , at age 17 . Even though it was painful , having those experiences earlier on in life prepared Jinnies to step without fear into the spotlight as one of the NFL 's first male dancers . `` It would have sucked , '' he says of making his debut on the sidelines , `` if I was worrying about what is everyone else thinking , you know ? I was worrying about my material , my choreography . Where am I standing ? Is a football player going to run into me ? I have other things going on in my head versus is someone going to call me a faggot . '' With added ranks this year , the NFL 's male cheerleaders can lean on one another for support , via their big group Facebook message where they encourage one another . Last year , Peron says , a guy named Dylon was cut during the finals for the Pelicans auditions . `` He was like , ` Q , I just want to say thank you . You making the team gave me hope . I 'm going to try out for Saints next year . ' '' The Saints picked him up this season , along with another man , plus Hernandez makes three . The Buccaneers and the Eagles each hired a male cheerleader ; the Patriots added two . The Seahawks Dancers , formerly known as the Sea Gals , added a team of eight men , and the Titans added eight as well . All told , there are at least 25 men on official NFL cheer rosters this year . The NFL is n't alone in moving toward co-ed entertainment teams ; the NBA is increasingly dumping its all-women , jazz - and pom-focused dance teams and opting for hip-hop-focused troupes that feature men and women instead . Laudable though these efforts may seem , reconfiguring dance teams in this way creates its own burdens for trained female dancers , who now feel squeezed out of the profession . One such dancer is Bailey Davis , who made headlines last year after she was dismissed by the New Orleans Saints after posting an image of herself in a black lacy bodysuit on Instagram . She had planned to restart her career in Orlando , where she 'd moved with the intention of trying out to be a dancer for the NBA 's Magic . But when the Magic scrapped its traditional dance team in favor of this new approach , she was out of luck . `` I understand wanting to make it more family-friendly , but saying that an all-female team is not family-friendly is not the girls ' fault , '' Davis says . `` That 's a management problem . '' Across the sports world , the trend is a concerted effort to walk back the overly sexed-up image these pro leagues implemented years ago . Of course , those inclined to be a little suspicious of the motives of league executives suggest that employing more men makes cheerleading seem less like a gendered job , which may weaken women 's claims of sex discrimination . `` It 's taking these guys and slotting them into their same exploitative system that the women have been a part of for decades , '' Gu says . At my childhood dance studio in suburban Atlanta , boys were a rarity . Occasionally , one would show up for a year , maybe stick it out long enough to perform at a recital . But then they 'd quit -- for soccer , or basketball , or tae kwon do , conveniently taught just a few doors over in the strip mall . Every so often , my teachers could persuade someone 's brother to guest as Tarzan or Elvis for a big opening number . When we did wrangle one , though , they were the centerpiece of the routine . They stood in the middle , had separate choreography , and , of course , a different costume . In a sport where the whole point is to blend in and move in synchronicity , they were made to stand out . In the routines I get a chance to observe at practice , the Rams highlight Peron and Jinnies this way , too . Cheerleaders are typically sorted by height into mini-squads called `` lines , '' and both men are positioned in the center spot of their pods . In a halftime routine that 's ultimately abandoned for Sunday 's game because T-Pain agrees to perform at the last minute , they 're featured prominently and execute an impressive turn sequence as their teammates dance around them . Otherwise , though , the two men do perform nearly the exact same choreography as the women . Shimmies and shakes and all . There are , however , certain subtle differences in how the movements are performed -- an open hand instead of a fist , a less exaggerated pli\u00e9 . While they do n't feel pressure to present more masculine , exactly , Peron and Jinnies talk a lot about underscoring their movements with strength . `` As a professional , '' Peron says , `` your job is to make -LSB- the choreography -RSB- work for you . Not change the choreography , but we can dance it a little differently . ... I do n't want to say make it more masculine -- I hate that -- but just making it a little stronger . '' `` For the most part , '' Peron says , `` I think -LSB- having men on the team -RSB- pushed our choreographers , because now it 's not just about the hair and the booty . '' One of their teammates , Shayla Gabbedon , echoes that sentiment . `` Our society believes that men are stronger and more powerful , and I think they bring that dynamic to our team , '' she says . But at the same time , `` it is sort of a reminder for us . We have to be strong , too . '' The only obvious difference between Jinnies and Peron and the women on the team is that the men do n't use pom-poms . `` That was a question I asked them early on , '' recalls coach Fimbres-Bledsoe . `` They both said , ` We 're not interested in pom-poms . ' '' In fact , from the moment they made the team , Jinnies and Peron have participated in nearly every facet of the decision-making in terms of their incorporation within the team . They were closely involved in designing their costume -- a form-fitting shirt-and-pants set with a slight V-neck , a curved hem , and sleeves that allow their cut biceps to flex away -- and making sure they were functional for game time . `` When we put our arms down , the shirt slides straight back down . It does n't get bunched up , and we do n't have to adjust . Every little detail was thought out , '' Jinnies says . `` It 's like the treatment the football players would get . '' They also receive all the comped swag the women get , including access to makeup professionals on game days -- but as a makeup artist himself , Jinnies applies his own , usually a warm , smoky eye , blown out for the stage . `` If they get fake ... well , I use the lashes for when I do makeup on other clients , but they give us , you know , the nylons , they give us the nails , '' Jinnies says . They get dressed together in the same trailer , too , which was a no-brainer decision from the entire squad . Interestingly , Peron and Jinnies cite the corporate-sponsored events as their favorite part of the job , and over-delivered on their quota of 20 last year , perhaps partially due to the uptick in requests for appearances after their historic hiring . Jinnies says that people will ask , `` ` Oh , do you make enough money ? ' And I 'm like , ` If you 're available to work , you make enough money . ' But then also this is n't everyone 's only job . So can you imagine having your career and then having this -LSB- other -RSB- awesome paying job if you 're available to make more , '' he says , also noting they 're compensated for every mile they travel . `` It 's like a normal job -- you do n't do work for your company and not get paid . '' And for the most part , except for the occasional fan who 's too many Bud Lights deep , the Rams community has been supportive . `` The bullying , I expected it , of course , '' says Jinnies . `` Not everyone 's going to get it , but I also realized that it 's not my job to make them try to understand or get it . '' Late on Thursday , just a few days before Sunday 's game , the cheerleaders are practicing their routines in fluorescently lit , too-tight quarters at a downtown 24 Hour Fitness . It 's L.A. , so the normie gym-goers are an unusually attractive and fit bunch , but even so , the Rams cheerleaders stand out . It 's just practice , but a film crew is taping tonight , so the women arrive in coordinated navy leggings , loose I-woke-up-like-this curls , full-face makeup , and tank tops emblazoned with phrases like CHEERLEADER , tied up in seemingly impractical but admittedly flattering ways . Peron and Jinnies , meanwhile , wear matching tees and shorts . At one point during the rehearsal , a man walks in from the weight room and , making no eye contact , walks silently to the back , where he proceeds to rest one hand on the mirrored wall and feign the weakest stretching I have ever seen . He 's not directly facing the women , but there are mirrors on every wall , and it 's clear why he 's there . One of the cheerleaders ' PR managers runs over to explain that this is a closed practice and he needs to leave , but he refuses , until the 24 Hour Fitness guys from the front desk arrive to manually escort him out . Peron has dealt with female fans going into Magic Mike mode at events . `` I went to this one event where you were not supposed to be touched , '' Peron says . `` And for some reason , I guess the ladies get excited now , and so they 're all on me and I 'm like , ` Hold on . ' But one of the guys grabbed my teammate Val -- just to get a picture . And I could tell where his arm was , but had to jump in and was like , ` Hey , sorry . None of that . You can take a picture together , but please hands to yourself , hands by your side . ' '' But for every off-putting fan interaction the cheerleaders deal with , there 's a positive one to counter it . Reading with grade-schoolers on Dr. Seuss day , Christmas shopping with underprivileged kids , visiting with the troops overseas -- those are the memories that stand out . Earlier this year , Jinnies surprise dropped in on a local elementary cheer team after hearing one of the boys who 'd signed up was being teased about it . `` I gave him one of my Super Bowl Rams pins and told them about teamwork and how they have to rally together and protect each other , '' he says . `` You never know who you 're touching . Whatever second you can offer up could be potentially , hopefully , life-changing . '' It 's all made even sweeter when they consider that , just a few years ago , this dream job was n't a viable career path . After hitting the ceiling on their post-collegiate competitive dance opportunities , the All Stars teammates were beginning to audition for NBA and NFL teams . Jinnies recalls one moment in particular when a girl called up their coach for encouragement before her final audition . `` Everyone was around the phone like , ` You 've got it , girl ! ' encouraging her , and I remember thinking , ` I will never be in that situation . I will never be at a finals for a pro team , calling my coach , getting that pumped before I need to go dance . ' It was not an option at the time . '' But then last year they showed up and made it one . `` For me , '' Peron says , `` that uniform ... it 's like a superhero cape .

I have A LOT to say about fitness , especially as a gay man . Where do I begin ? Fitness for me equals journey . I 'm still walking down this long , fun , frustrating road that I call my fitness journey . I ca n't remember when I started calling myself fat . Maybe it was late in high school , maybe it was college , but at some point while growing up I started this vicious cycle of going to food for comfort . Once I would shove the double cheeseburger down my throat with a large fry and some diet coke , I would immediately feel regret . In those four to five minutes -LRB- I can throw down on some food real fast -RRB- it would take me to devour everything , I felt like I could literally feel the endorphins releasing into my blood stream . The burger never rejected me . The fries never made me feel less than . The diet coke would laugh at my jokes . Food was everything I ever wanted out of a guy . That burger and fries never stood me up on a date . I turned to food to celebrate good times and to make myself feel better after anything negative hit my life . Then college ended . In that spring semester of my senior year I went from weighing around 180 pounds to pushing 300 . After I turned 21 I found booze , buffalo wings and ranch . I could n't get enough . By the time I went to my first gay club in Savannah , Georgia , I was pretty good with the negative self-talk . `` Miguel , this shirt is too tight for you . Gosh , you fatty , put the damn french fry down so someone will learn to love you . '' Those are the type of thoughts that would run through my head at any given point after eating a meal . After experiencing different tribes of people staying in their tribes and ignoring anyone that looked differently than they did , my negative self-talk went through the roof . At 21 , just graduated and only a few dating situations under my belt , I felt like I needed to lose weight in order to get a man . That began my next decade of trying every diet under the sun . Weight Watchers , starving myself , avoiding carbs , utilizing meal prep services , hiring personal trainers , undergoing liquid diets and taking special pills -- I have tried it all . Every time I would go through a cycle of losing weight I would work my ass off for a few months , lose weight for about a month or so and then go back to slowly putting it back on . It was not a fun experience . In that time , even when I lost weight guys would still not talk to me . I thought being skinny equaled getting a man . What was I missing ? I could n't figure out what I was doing wrong -- and then I walked into my first CrossFit class . I know what you are thinking . Did Miguel write all of this to now try and sell me on CrossFit ? No . I 'm not trying to do that ; I 'm just telling you what worked for me . From the moment I started the journey with CrossFit , my self-talk started to change . I 've gone up and down with weight since I 've been attending classes , but the biggest change I 've seen is how I view myself . I used to attack each workout because I felt like it would get me closer to my goal weight , which would make me dateable . I 'm so mad at myself for thinking that way . This is why it 's called a journey . After going through my first CrossFit competition a few years ago , my energy in the gym turned to correcting my form , gaining strength and developing mental toughness to work through difficult workouts . About two years ago , after working on my mind and self-talk , I was getting ready for work . I noticed that for the first time since high school , I liked the way I looked . No , I loved the way I looked . Not because I had a six pack -- I did n't -- but the person looking back in the mirror was a man who had finally found confidence in himself . I had learned to love my curves and embrace the power in my thick thighs . I did n't need to look a certain way to be loved . Those thoughts set off an explosion in my head . Since then , I 've regularly had to make sure that I was n't doing the negative self-talk . I spend so much time with myself , why would I want to expose myself to so much negativity ? You do n't need a personal trainer to learn to love yourself -- you just need to look at what 's on the inside . So as you go into 2020 and work on those fitness goals , focus on how it 's going to make you feel , not how you are going to look . It 's great losing that weight , but when does it stop ? Will you ever like the way you look ? Not until you also work on what 's happening on the inside . That process can be just as tough as the workout you do in the gym . Happy New Year !

0.0	{"docid": "0NrTHOK3", "title": "Infertility", "content": "Last updated : October 2019 Our science and research team is compiling the most significant studies and information on an array of health topics , conditions , and diseases . If there is something you 'd like them to cover , please email us at -LSB- email protected -RSB- . Understanding Infertility If the careful timing of menstrual cycles is n't working and you 've been trying to conceive for a while , you may want to seek more options . This can be incredibly difficult emotionally , mentally , and physically . The good news is : There are many options for women , men , and couples who want to conceive . The research is starting to tell us more about new possible strategies and interventions that can help . And there is support -- you are not alone . How Long Do People Typically Try to Conceive ? Around 85 percent of couples conceive within a year of trying to become pregnant and most conceive long before the one-year mark . Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive a child within one year , or within six months if the woman is thirty-five or older -LRB- because it 's important to act sooner after this age -RRB- . And while a small number of people end up conceiving on their own in their second year of trying , this is fairly uncommon -LRB- UCLA , 2011 -RRB- . Potential Causes and Related Health Concerns Fertility issues can be due to factors affecting the man , the woman , or both . One of the most common causes of infertility is maternal age . For most women , the ability to conceive decreases after the early thirties due to a decline in egg quality . Other reasons could be ovulation disorders , such as polycystic ovary syndrome -LRB- PCOS -RRB- , tubal blockage caused by a history of sexual transmitted infections -LRB- STIs -RRB- , uterine fibroids , endometrial polyps , endometriosis , or issues with the quality of the male 's sperm . Other times , the root cause of infertility can not be pinpointed . But regardless of the reason -LRB- or lack of one -RRB- , fertility treatments can still help . In this article , we 'll discuss several lifestyle changes and treatments that are preventative and may improve your probability of giving birth during a given menstrual cycle -LRB- defined as fecundability in the medical literature -RRB- , as well as interventions that can improve fertility and chances of carrying a healthy baby to full term . Causes of Female Infertility Female infertility can be due to a number of causes , such as ovulation issues , infections , tubal blockages , hormonal imbalances , cysts , a misshapen uterus , as well as other diagnoses , including polycystic ovary syndrome -LRB- PCOS -RRB- , endometriosis , primary ovary insufficiency -LRB- POI -RRB- , or uterine fibroids -LRB- NIH , 2017c ; Taymor , 2012 -RRB- . Things to Tell Your Doctor before Trying to Conceive For women : If you have a history of STIs , irregular periods , endometriosis , or pelvic inflammatory disease ; have had miscarriages ; or are undergoing cancer treatment , talk to your doctor as early as possible to discuss how this may affect your ability to conceive . For men : Talk to your doctor if you 've had previous issues conceiving with a partner , have a history of testicular or sexual problems , have a low sperm count , have testicular swelling , or have family members with a history of fertility issues . Certain medications can also affect fertility , so talk to your doctor about any prescriptions you or your partner are on . Causes of Male Infertility Male infertility can be caused by impaired sperm production or sperm development , impaired sperm motility , low sperm count , genetics , or infections or STIs -LRB- Taymor , 2012 -RRB- . Miscarriages Miscarriages -LRB- early pregnancy loss -RRB- are an extremely common occurrence among women trying to conceive . Women with fertility issues have an even higher risk of miscarriage , and this risk increases with age -LRB- Hakim et al. , 1995 -RRB- . Miscarriage is also common among women undergoing fertility treatments . Maternal obesity , smoking , and alcohol use have been associated with an increased risk of miscarriages , and a 2017 meta-analysis found that subclinical hypothyroidism was also related to increased risk of miscarriage -LRB- Agenor & Bhattacharya , 2015 ; Zhang et al. , 2017 -RRB- . A miscarriage does not mean you are infertile : It is usually a one-time occurrence , and you can begin ovulating and become pregnant soon after if you desire . If you 've experienced a miscarriage , see your health practitioner and consider reaching out to others for support . Grieving is very normal -- for more on healing after a pregnancy loss , read our Q&A with postpartum and loss doula Stephanie Matthias . If you 've experienced multiple pregnancy losses , consider seeing a fertility specialist for further assessment and treatment . To learn more about miscarriage , see our Q&A with fertility specialist Kristin Bendikson , MD. . How Fertility Is Assessed To assess female fertility , your health care provider will ask about your health history , including any history of previous STIs , pregnancies , miscarriages , or pelvic pain . They may start with a pelvic exam , ultrasound , or Pap smear to check for any obvious -LRB- to them -RRB- physical abnormalities . If nothing is immediately apparent from this initial screening , there are several more involved laboratory tests your doctor may also perform . A blood test can be used to measure your hormone levels . Normal levels of progesterone indicate that you are ovulating properly each cycle , while follicle-stimulating hormone -LRB- FSH -RRB- and anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone -LRB- AMH -RRB- signal healthy egg production . What Are Typical Ranges for Female Hormones ? To test your hormone levels , your health care practitioner will take a blood test and send it to a lab for testing . \u2022 Typical progesterone levels are less than 3 nanograms per milliliter -LRB- ng/mL -RRB- during the follicular phase -LRB- start of menstruation until ovulation -RRB- and between 5 and 20 ng/mL during the secretory phase -LRB- ovulation until menstruation begins -RRB- . \u2022 AMH levels can be measured during any part of the menstrual cycle and typically range from 0.9 to 9.5 ng/mL . \u2022 Basal FSH levels -LRB- FSH levels during the early follicular stage -RRB- are an indicator of ovarian age and have historically been used in prescreening women for fertility treatments . Normal values range from 5 to 20 milli-international units per liter -LRB- mIU/L -RRB- . Recent studies have questioned the utility of basal FSH prescreening given that there are different threshold methods that sort women into normal or elevated -LRB- caution against IVF treatment -RRB- perhaps without clinical significance -LRB- Scott et al. , 2008 -RRB- . X-rays or laparoscopy of your fallopian tubes may be used to determine whether there are any blockages . Scarring or uterine fibroids may be another cause of infertility , which can be identified through transvaginal ultrasound or a vaginal scope -LRB- hysteroscopy -RRB- -LRB- NIH , 2017b -RRB- . Infertility Diagnosis and Treatment for Couples If a couple is seeking treatment for infertility , the relative fertility of both partners should be assessed , since many times there may be factors affecting both the man and the woman . For example , a woman may have partial tubal blockage that together with her partner 's low sperm count results in the inability to conceive . Diagnosis and treatment should be a partnership between the man and the woman to assess all aspects of fertility in order to optimize the probability of a successful pregnancy -LRB- Taymor , 2012 -RRB- . Men can either be treated by their partner 's ob-gyn or choose to see a urologist . To diagnose male infertility , a complete medical history and exam will be taken to determine if there are any current infections , a history of STIs , or previous issues conceiving with another partner . A semen analysis may be taken to determine viscosity , volume , motility , concentration , and morphology of sperm . A postcoital test may also be performed to determine if sperm is surviving in the woman 's cervical mucus , which could indicate a problem in either partner -LRB- Taymor , 2012 -RRB- . Dietary Changes Eating a diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids is important , either from low-mercury fish or from a fish oil supplement . Reducing caffeine intake may be helpful . The research on meat intake and soy has been mixed . Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids -LRB- PUFAs -RRB- and Fish Polyunsaturated fatty acids -LRB- PUFAs -RRB- are critical for reproduction , specifically aiding in the development of the baby 's brain and eyes -LRB- NIH , 2019b -RRB- . Studies have also suggested that PUFAs may promote fertility by improving egg quality and implantation -LRB- Gaskins & Chavarro , 2018 -RRB- . Several large-cohort studies have shown that women who report higher intakes of omega-3 PUFAs have higher fecundability and reduced risk of anovulation -LRB- no ovulation -RRB- . Women who reported a higher intake of trans fatty acids were found to have greater risk of infertility and reduced fecundability -LRB- Chavarro et al. , 2007 ; Mumford et al. , 2016 ; Wise et al. , 2018 -RRB- . -LRB- Trans fatty acids are a type of unsaturated fat found primarily in fried foods and baked goods , but they are also present in some meat and dairy products in small amounts -- they are known to raise cholesterol levels . -RRB- So : Higher intake of PUFAs and lower intake of trans fatty acids are associated with enhanced fertility . The American Pregnancy Association -LRB- APA -RRB- recommends that women take a supplement containing both DHA and EPA starting up to six months prior to conception -LRB- APA , 2014 -RRB- . The FDA recommends that women who are pregnant , planning to become pregnant , or breastfeeding eat eight to twelve ounces a week of fish that is low in mercury in order to reap the health benefits -LRB- FDA , 2014 -RRB- . Which Fish Are Lowest in Mercury and Best to Eat for Fertility ? Fish lowest on the food chain , such as salmon or shrimp , have the lowest levels of mercury because metals bioaccumulate up the food chain in larger fish , such as swordfish and bluefin tuna . Some studies , although not all , have suggested that women with higher mercury levels may have reduced fertility -LRB- Gaskins & Chavarro , 2018 -RRB- . Ideally , you want to eat a moderate amount of low-mercury fish and supplement with a good fish oil that contains both EPA and DHA . Vegans and vegetarians can get alpha-linolenic acid -LRB- which the body slowly converts to EPA and DHA -RRB- from flaxseed oil , soybean oil , chia seeds , and walnuts , or they can get both EPA and DHA from an algal oil supplement . Meat There 's not a lot of research on meat consumption and fertility , but preliminary studies have suggested that eating meat may be associated with poor reproduction . A 2008 study found that for women , eating an additional serving of any type of meat -LRB- red meat , chicken , turkey , or fish -RRB- daily was associated with an increased risk of infertility , whereas eating vegetable protein instead of animal protein was associated with a reduction in infertility risk -LRB- Chavarro et al. , 2008 -RRB- . A separate study , in 2015 , found that eating red meat prior to IVF treatment was associated with reduced likelihood of pregnancy -LRB- Braga et al. , 2015 -RRB- . Further research is needed in this area to see if there is an actual link between meat consumption and fertility . Soy Women of reproductive age have been raised to fear soy because it contains very weak , estrogen-like compounds called phytoestrogens . Phytoestrogens have been shown in preclinical studies to adversely affect both male and female reproduction ; however , phytoestrogens have not been shown to negatively impact reproduction in clinical trials . Several small studies have even suggested that soy may be beneficial to women undergoing fertility treatments -LRB- Gaskins & Chavarro , 2018 -RRB- . Of particular note , a 2015 study found that among American women undergoing IVF , those who had the highest intake of soy phytoestrogens had 77 percent higher odds of a live birth -LRB- Vanegas et al. , 2015 -RRB- . While there 's not yet evidence to recommend soy supplements for women trying to become pregnant , there is a lack of evidence for the soy scare that has plagued so many women . -LRB- For more , see this comprehensive summary of the state of the research on phytoestrogens and soy by reproductive endocrinologist Amber Cooper , MD , at the Vios Fertility Institute in St. Louis , Missouri . -RRB- Caffeine While it 's known that coffee intake during pregnancy should be limited because it 's a stressor to the baby , it has not been clear whether coffee and caffeine consumption are related to reduced fertility in women trying to conceive -LRB- WHO , 2019 -RRB- . A 2017 meta-analysis found evidence that caffeine intake may be associated with miscarriage risk . But the researchers did not find an association between caffeine and a woman 's or couple 's fertility -LRB- Lyngso et al. , 2017 -RRB- . However , a study published after this meta-analysis was completed found that higher caffeine intake in males was associated with a lower live birth rate after IVF -LRB- Karmon et al. , 2017 -RRB- . So you may want to cut back on your caffeine intake or discuss it with your doctor . Nutrients and Supplements Take a folic acid and iron supplement . Take a fish oil supplement if you 're not eating enough fish . Folic Acid While it is well-established that taking folic acid -LRB- a type of B vitamin -RRB- during pregnancy can help prevent neural tube defects , there has been controversy over whether supplementing with folic acid -LRB- folate -RRB- prepregnancy is beneficial or perhaps harmful , with some studies suggesting that it may increase risk of miscarriage . A review published in 2016 found no evidence that folic acid supplementation had any effect on risk of fetal loss , miscarriage , or stillbirth -LRB- Balogun et al. , 2016 -RRB- . And some more-recent studies published since that review have suggested that folic acid may reduce risk of miscarriage , while also conferring other benefits , such as lower risk of infertility and shorter time to pregnancy -LRB- Gaskins & Chavarro , 2018 -RRB- . The CDC recommends that all reproductive-age women take 400 micrograms of folic acid per day -LRB- CDC , 2018 -RRB- . While you can get folic acid from certain vegetables -LRB- like spinach , asparagus , and Brussels sprouts -RRB- and fortified foods , you may be better off taking a daily multivitamin that contains folic acid and iron , which taken together have been shown to confer the most benefits for fertility -LRB- Gaskins & Chavarro , 2018 -RRB- . Pregnant women are recommended twenty-seven milligrams of iron daily and between nine and ten milligrams of iron during lactation -LRB- NIH , 2019a -RRB- . Make sure to also get enough omega-3 fatty acids , or take a fish oil supplement in addition to your prenatal multivitamin . Lifestyle Changes for Infertility Timing sex with ovulation and maintaining a healthy weight are crucial when trying to become pregnant . Managing stress , avoiding alcohol and drugs , and reducing your exposure to environmental toxins are also key . Time of the Month Having sex frequently around the time of ovulation is your best bet at getting pregnant because this is the time of the month when a mature egg is able to be fertilized . The fertile window typically begins a few days leading up to ovulation and can last twenty-four hours after ovulation . In a healthy woman with an average twenty-eight-day cycle , ovulation usually occurs at day fourteen of the cycle . You can track your cycle with various smartphone apps to predict ovulation -LRB- such as Clue or Moody App -RRB- . There are also home urine tests that can predict ovulation by testing progesterone levels -LRB- we keep it simple with Clearblue -RRB- . You may be able to recognize the signs that you are ovulating : having more interest in sex or a change in your vaginal discharge . What Are the Phases of the Menstrual Cycle ? The menstrual cycle lasts between twenty-four and thirty-eight days and may vary from cycle to cycle . It starts on the first day of your period and ends when your next period begins . It can be thought of as three distinct events : preovulation , ovulation , and postovulation . During the preovulatory cycle -LRB- also called the follicular phase -RRB- , menstruation occurs , and estrogen and progesterone levels are low as the uterine lining is shed . A regular period lasts for an average of five days . Then follicle stimulating hormone -LRB- FSH signals that an egg should be prepared , which causes estrogen levels to rise as the egg grows . The second part of the follicular phase occurs when the period ends and the uterine lining is built back up again to prepare itself for egg implantation -LRB- this is called the proliferative phase -RRB- . About halfway through the menstrual cycle , ovulation occurs : Estrogen levels peak and then drop , which causes luteinizing hormone -LRB- LH -RRB- to be released and signals to the body to start ovulation -LRB- the release of the egg from the ovary -RRB- . In the postovulatory phase , before the start of the next period , the body prepares for a possible pregnancy by increasing progesterone and estrogen levels , which allows the uterine lining to build up again for implantation . This is called the luteal or secretory phase . If no fertilization happens , estrogen and progesterone levels will drop , menstruation will begin , and the whole cycle will start over again . Contraception After stopping hormonal contraception use , it may take a while for your body to return to fertility . Studies have shown that it may take a few months after quitting hormonal contraceptives for your body to go back to normal . Twelve months after stopping birth control , pregnancy rates have been shown to be similar across different types of birth control -LRB- oral contraceptives and IUDs -RRB- so there does n't appear to be any long-term effects of birth control on fertility in the research -LRB- Barnhart & Schreiber , 2009 -RRB- . Sexual Health Protecting yourself from sexual transmitted infections is important for maintaining a healthy reproductive system . Pelvic inflammatory disease -LRB- PID -RRB- and STIs such as chlamydia can increase your risk of infertility by scarring the fallopian tubes . STIs such as gonorrhea may affect male sperm quality -LRB- Ochsendorf , 2008 -RRB- . Infections of the cervix related to human papilloma virus can affect cervical mucous , which may adversely affect female fertility -LRB- NIH , 2017c -RRB- . If you do n't know your STI status , get tested , and be sure your partner has been tested , too . Treating STIs as soon as possible helps to prevent long-term issues such as scarring or PID . If you are currently trying to conceive and have previously had STIs or PID , talk to your doctor about your medical history . Maintaining a Healthy Weight Being either overweight or underweight can cause fertility issues . Being underweight is associated with lower likelihood of becoming pregnant and higher risk of miscarriage -LRB- Oliveira , 2018 -RRB- . The risk of infertility is three times higher in women who are obese compared to nonobese women , primarily due to hormonal dysfunction -LRB- Silvestris et al. , 2018 -RRB- . Specifically , levels of anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone -LRB- AMH -RRB- , which indicates ovarian function , have been shown to be lower in women who are obese , especially those with PCOS , in which AMH is often used as a marker for diagnosis -LRB- Dumont et al. , 2015 ; Moy et al. , 2015 -RRB- . For women who are obese , weight loss has been shown to improve fertility and in vitro fertilization success , particularly for women thirty-five or younger -LRB- Silvestris et al. , 2018 -RRB- . Obesity can also affect male fertility . According to a 2015 meta-analysis , couples in which the man is obese are more likely to experience infertility than couples in which the man is a healthy weight . Additionally , male obesity is associated with a significantly lower live birth rate from assisted reproductive technology -LRB- Campbell et al. , 2015 -RRB- . In order to maintain a healthy weight , follow a healthy diet and a consistent exercise regimen , which may improve fertility for both partners . Exercise and important dietary components are discussed below . Exercise Exercise is an important aspect of a healthy lifestyle and is especially crucial for people who are obese and having trouble conceiving . A 2017 meta-analysis found that a low-calorie diet and exercise improved women 's pregnancy rates and ovulation -LRB- Best et al. , 2017 -RRB- . Consistent physical exercise was found in one study to be associated with higher assisted reproductive technology -LRB- ART -RRB- success rates for women who were obese -LRB- Palomba et al. , 2014 -RRB- . For men , six months of resistance training was shown in one study to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in seminal fluid and to improve fertility -LRB- Hajizadeh Maleki & Tartibian , 2018 -RRB- . There is n't solid evidence to indicate which type of exercise is best for fertility , and in general , what suits one person is different from what works for another . For women , it 's important to note that exercising too often or engaging in physically strenuous activities can sometimes cause ovulation problems or dysmenorrhea -LRB- lack of periods -RRB- . Some doctors recommend moderate , low-impact exercise as most beneficial for women who are trying to become pregnant . Talk to your doctor to develop an exercise program that is right for you . Quitting Drinking and Smoking Not only does drinking during pregnancy have significant risks for the fetus but drinking when trying to conceive can also pose problems . Alcohol has been shown to reduce female fecundability as well as male fertility , perhaps by impacting sperm quality -LRB- Fan et al. , 2017 ; Karmon et al. , 2017 ; La Vignera et al. , 2013 -RRB- . If you 're having trouble conceiving , try reducing your alcohol intake . Smoking can cause reproductive issues and impaired fertility . Cigarette smoking is associated with reduced ovarian function and lower pregnancy rates in women -LRB- Vanvoorhis et al. , 1996 -RRB- . Male smoking is associated with reduced semen quality , sperm development , sperm maturation , and sperm function -LRB- Dai et al. , 2015 -RRB- . Men and women should quit smoking before attempting to become pregnant . Stress Management Struggling with infertility can undoubtedly be stressful for women and men . And it can create a vicious cycle of stress , which might lead to further problems conceiving . Although there has not been consistent evidence showing that stress is related to reduced fertility , many practitioners consider stress management , mental health , and emotional health to be integral to fertility treatment . Women with infertility report high levels of anxiety and depression , and infertility can lead to relationship issues as the partners attempt multiple treatments and deal with setbacks and disappointments -LRB- Rooney & Domar , 2018 -RRB- . It 's important to manage your stress through whatever means necessary : exercise , yoga , mind-body techniques , relaxation , massage , etc. . Couples therapy may also help you work through relationship difficulties . Endocrine Disruptors Reduce your exposure to endocrine disruptors as much as reasonably possible . Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are virtually everywhere these days -- from inside our shampoo bottle to the lining of canned foods . This is not meant to freak to you out . We hope it might empower you -- because the good news is that we 've gotten better at identifying where these chemicals live and finding ways to reduce our exposure . What Are Endocrine Disruptors ? Some endocrine disruptors that have been shown to affect fertility include phthalates , pesticides , parabens , triclosan , and heavy metals -LRB- Rattan et al. , 2017 -RRB- . Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that affect various systems of the body by altering hormone levels . They have been linked to developmental disorders , birth defects , obesity , and other harmful outcomes in both children and adults . And the worst part is that they 're ubiquitous in our environments -- found in personal-care products , household cleaners , perfumes , and even food products . The EARTH study , which started in 2001 and is sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences -LRB- NIEHS -RRB- , is currently recruiting subjects from Massachusetts General Hospital to determine how self-reported exposure to environmental toxins over the course of a lifetime impacts female and male fertility . Thanks to this sort of research , we will better understand how endocrine disruptors like phthalates , pesticides , parabens , triclosan , and heavy metals affect our health . Until then , here 's how we 're reducing our exposure . A checklist to help reduce your exposure to endocrine disruptors : \u2022 Buy clean personal-care and household products that are free of endocrine disruptors and nontoxic to humans . You can check how clean your products are on websites like Skin Deep by the Environmental Working Group . -LRB- Everything in the goop shop is clean . -RRB- \u2022 If revamping your entire personal-care-product and cosmetics portfolio seems like a complete nightmare right now , start with the products that you spread over the greatest surface area of your body . This could be a lotion , a body wash , or a sunscreen . \u2022 Buy organic produce as much as possible . \u2022 Eat fewer canned foods . \u2022 Microwave your food in glass containers instead of plastic -LRB- which can leach into your food when heated -RRB- . \u2022 Eat wild-caught fish instead of farmed fish . Avoid salmon from the Atlantic in northern Europe , as it is known to be high in dioxins -LRB- Foran et al. , 2005 -RRB- . Egg Freezing With many people delaying parenthood until later in life , egg freezing has become increasingly of interest as an option for preserving a woman 's fertility as she ages . The process involves injections of ovulation-stimulating medications that induce egg growth . The woman comes into the doctor 's office every few days for an ultrasound to check the eggs ' growth . The eggs are retrieved from the ovaries using a small needle , and then the eggs are frozen . To learn more about egg freezing , read our Q&A with reproductive endocrinologist Lisa Grossman Becht , MD. . For women who are undergoing cancer treatment or other aggressive treatments , egg freezing may be recommended before chemotherapy , radiation , or other surgeries that may impact fertility . Talk to your doctor or a fertility specialist to determine if this is necessary and what the best options are for you . Conventional Treatment Options for Infertility Infertility can be treated by a combination of ovulation-inducing medications and assisted reproductive technology . In certain cases , surgery may be recommended by your doctor . Medications There are several medications that women can take to stimulate ovulation . These medications can be taken alone as a first-line treatment for irregular or absent periods , or they may be given in combination with assisted reproductive technologies -LRB- ART -RRB- . Clomiphene citrate -LRB- CC -RRB- -- Clomid -- is an oral medication that stimulates the pituitary gland to release more FSH and LH , which allow eggs to mature in the ovaries . Clomid is taken at the beginning of the menstrual cycle . Side effects may include flushing , ovarian pain , blurry vision , nausea , and headaches . Another medication that stimulates ovulation is a class of hormones called gonadotropins . Human menopausal gonadotropin -LRB- hMG -RRB- is administered by injection and contains FSH , which stimulates ovulation . Other FSH products that are purified from urine are also used . Human chronic gonadotropin -LRB- hCG -RRB- , which is similar to LH , can also be injected to trigger the egg to release . Women who take gonadotropins have a high chance of twins and triplets . Other medications may also be prescribed for related health issues . For example , metformin is an antidiabetic medication that can be used to treat infertility related to polycystic ovary syndrome -LRB- PCOS -RRB- or insulin resistance . Metformin can be taken alone or in combination with Clomid -LRB- Morley et al. , 2017 -RRB- . Additional medications include letrozole , which decreases estrogen levels to stimulate egg release , and bromocriptine or cabergoline , which treat high levels of prolactin that may interfere with ovulation -LRB- NIH , 2017a -RRB- . Artificial Insemination -LRB- AI -RRB- One of the most common fertility treatments that doctors start with when a couple is having trouble conceiving is AI . During AI , a woman 's ovulation is carefully monitored and medications such as Clomid or gonadotropins may be taken to stimulate ovulation . A semen specimen -LRB- produced beforehand by the male partner or from a sperm donor -RRB- is processed and placed into the uterine cavity of the woman , in a process that is fairly similar to a Pap smear . Assisted Reproductive Technology -LRB- ART -RRB- and In Vitro Fertilization -LRB- IVF -RRB- ART refers to any type of fertility treatment that involves fertilization outside of the body . The most well-known type of ART is in vitro fertilization -LRB- IVF -RRB- in which a mature egg is collected from the woman 's ovaries and fertilized by the man 's sperm in a lab . The fertilized egg or eggs are then transferred back to the woman 's uterus . IVF may be used for women who have no fallopian tubes or fallopian tubes that are blocked , women with endometriosis , women with other types of fertility issues , or for issues with male sperm count or motility . Because IVF is an invasive procedure , it is generally used only after a couple has tried fertility drugs or AIH . Third-party-assisted ART may involve sperm donation or egg donation . Sperm or egg donors ' physical characteristics can be matched to those of the mother or father . A gestational carrier may be used if the woman ca n't or should n't become pregnant due to health reasons . The CDC publishes ART success rates for fertility clinics in the US , which can be useful when deciding where to get treatment . And you can learn more about IVF in our Q&A with Marcelle Cedars , MD , the director of UCSF 's Center for Reproductive Health . Surgery For certain conditions , including fallopian tubal obstruction , uterine fibroids , and polyps , your doctor may determine that surgery is necessary to treat those conditions , which may improve chances of becoming pregnant . Surgery may also be used to remove endometriosis tissue , which can double the chances of pregnancy according to the NIH -LRB- NIH , 2017a -RRB- . A side effect of fallopian tube surgery is an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy -LRB- a pregnancy that occurs outside of the uterus -RRB- . Alternate Treatment Options for Infertility Combining conventional treatment options with other therapies can help you manage stress levels and support your mental health during this process . Trying to become pregnant can feel overwhelming -- you do n't need to go through it alone . Psychotherapy Infertility can lead to feelings of unworthiness , depression , anger , anxiety , and significant stress for both partners . Additionally , couples may experience increased marital disputes or sex problems , and studies have shown that couples with infertility experience significantly greater depression and anxiety than fertile couples -LRB- Berardis et al. , 2014 -RRB- . Depression can also exacerbate problems with fertility : A 2018 study found that male depression was linked to a lower chance of pregnancy in couples being treated for infertility -LRB- Evans-Hoeker et al. , 2018 -RRB- . A therapist can be an important outlet , either for partners individually or in couples therapy . A 2015 meta-analysis found that psychosocial interventions -LRB- such as cognitive behavioral therapy , CBT -RRB- were associated with improved pregnancy rates and mental health , especially for female partners . The study also found that large reductions in anxiety were associated with improved pregnancy rate , highlighting the importance of managing stress and anxiety preconception -LRB- Frederiksen et al. , 2015 -RRB- . And ideally , all fertility approaches would be holistic and take into account the couple 's mental and physical health . Mind-Body Techniques Incorporating mind-body techniques into daily life can be hugely beneficial for helping us manage stress . Yoga is one such practice in which postures -LRB- asana -RRB- , breathwork -LRB- pranayama -RRB- , and meditation are used to stretch the body and relax the mind . A 2018 review found that yoga decreased stress , pain , depression , and anxiety in people struggling to become pregnant -LRB- Darbandi et al. , 2017 -RRB- . Other mind-body techniques that may help decrease stress and improve mental health include meditation , float tanks , body scans , repetitive mantras , and deep breathing . Two studies have shown that mindfulness-based programs that incorporate various mind-body techniques can be beneficial for women with infertility . A 2019 study found that eight weeks of meditation , relaxation , guided imagery , and other mindfulness techniques reduced infertile women 's stress and depression -LRB- Nery et al. , 2019 -RRB- . Another study found that women undergoing their first IVF treatment had improved quality of life and higher pregnancy rates when they took a six-week mindfulness-based intervention that incorporated breathwork , meditation , yoga , and body scans -LRB- Li et al. , 2016 -RRB- . Fertility Supplements Vitex , also known as chasteberry , is the fruit of the chaste tree that is sometimes used in the treatment of reproductive disorders , such as premenstrual syndrome -LRB- PMS -RRB- and PCOS . While there is not much evidence for the use of vitex for infertility , it is included as an ingredient in various fertility supplements marketed to women . For example , a nutritional supplement called FertilityBlend contains vitex along with green tea extracts , vitamins , folate , iron , magnesium , zinc , selenium , and l-arginine . In a small double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study , women who took FertilityBlend three times a day for three months had significantly more pregnancies -LRB- Lynn Marie Westphal et al. , 2004 -RRB- . This positive finding was replicated in a subsequent larger controlled study -LRB- Westphal , Polan , & Trant , 2006 -RRB- . It 's unclear whether these benefits were due to the vitex or the other helpful nutrients in the supplement , such as folate , but regardless , these results are promising . Of possible concern : The manufacturer of FertilityBlend was involved in both studies . Plant-Based Medicine Holistic approaches often require dedication , guidance , and working closely with an experienced practitioner . There are several certifications that designate an herbalist . The American Herbalists Guild provides a listing of registered herbalists , whose certification is designated RH -LRB- AHG -RRB- . Traditional Chinese medicine degrees include LAc -LRB- licensed acupuncturist -RRB- , OMD -LRB- doctor of Oriental medicine -RRB- , and DipCH -LRB- NCCA -RRB- -LRB- diplomate of Chinese herbology from the National Commission for the Certification of Acupuncturists -RRB- . Traditional Ayurvedic medicine from India is accredited in the US by the American Association of Ayurvedic Professionals of North America -LRB- AAPNA -RRB- and the National Ayurvedic Medical Association -LRB- NAMA -RRB- . There are also functional , holistic-minded practitioners -LRB- MDs , DOs , NDs , and DCs -RRB- who may use herbal protocols . Acupuncture In traditional Chinese medicine , the Ren Channel begins at a woman 's uterus and ascends across the abdomen and chest up to below the lower lip . It is said to signify fertility and is often called the conception vessel . Some acupuncturists specialize in working with people who are trying to conceive , and acupuncture targeting the Ren Channel has been studied for use in combination with IVF treatment . There have been conflicting results regarding its efficacy . A 2017 meta-analysis found that women , particularly Asians , undergoing IVF who received acupuncture treatments had significantly increased pregnancy rates . These results were most pronounced during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation , when fertility medications are given to stimulate ovulation -LRB- Qian et al. , 2017 -RRB- . However , a 2018 meta-analysis found that acupuncture on the day of embryo transfer is associated with a lower chance of pregnancy -LRB- Schwarze et al. , 2018 -RRB- . It seems that there may be windows of time where acupuncture may be more effective or perhaps harmful to IVF success . Orgasm It 's well known that there is an orgasm gap : In heterosexual partnerships , men tend to orgasm more than women . Of course , in the context of trying to conceive , the male orgasm is necessary to release the sperm . The female orgasm , meanwhile , has been thought to be unnecessary for pregnancy to occur . But some fertility experts believe we 've overlooked this , and that the orgasm gap may be to blame for some couples ' infertility . The theory is that physical satisfaction of both partners results in a higher chance of pregnancy due to vaginal contractions that cause the sperm to be carried farther up , increasing chances of fertilization . This theory is n't widely accepted in the medical community , and there are few studies to back it up . One small study from 2016 found that women who orgasmed during sex retained significantly more sperm than women who did not orgasm -LRB- King et al. , 2016 -RRB- . Regardless , for everyone 's mutual satisfaction , it 's worth closing the orgasm gap -LRB- and you can learn more about that in our Q&A with therapist and professor Laurie Mintz , PhD , who wrote the book Becoming Cliterate -RRB- . Massage Techniques to cope with the stress of infertility and its many treatments are hugely necessary for couples . One particular technique that has gained attention is a fertility massage , in which patients receive a massage prior to ART treatment . A 2015 study found that women who received an andullation massage with vibration and infrared heat on their abdomen prior to IVF embryo transfer had improved pregnancy and birth rates -LRB- Okhowat et al. , 2015 -RRB- . The authors hypothesized that this was probably due to deep relaxation . -LRB- There is no evidence that massage can improve egg quality or quantity . -RRB- New and Promising Research on Infertility Innovative techniques are being developed to support healthy pregnancies and approach infertility with new perspectives . How Do You Evaluate Clinical Studies and Identify Promising Results ? The results of clinical studies are described throughout this article , and you may wonder which treatments are worth discussing with your doctor . When a particular benefit is described in only one or two studies , consider it of possible interest , or perhaps worth discussing , but definitely not conclusive . Repetition is how the scientific community polices itself and verifies that a particular treatment is of value . When benefits can be reproduced by multiple investigators , they are more likely to be real and meaningful . We 've tried to focus on review articles and meta-analyses that take all the available results into account ; these are more likely to give us a comprehensive evaluation of a particular subject . Of course , there can be flaws in research , and if by chance all of the clinical studies on a particular therapy are flawed -- for example with insufficient randomization or lacking a control group -- then reviews and meta-analyses based on these studies will be flawed . But in general , it 's a compelling sign when research results can be repeated . Men 's Biological Clock While most women are well aware of their biological clock -LRB- a woman 's egg viability begins to decline in her thirties -RRB- , less attention has been paid to men 's sperm quality as they age . And because the number of children born to older men has doubled in recent years , researchers are investigating the health effects of older paternal age . And they 've found that it may come with health risks . Researchers at Rutgers University published a review in 2019 showing that older paternal age is associated with infertility , pregnancy complications , and adverse infant neurocognitive and psychological outcomes , including schizophrenia and autism . While the exact age at which these effects become more likely is not exactly clear , advanced paternal age has been described in the medical literature as somewhere between thirty-five and forty-five -LRB- Phillips et al. , 2019 -RRB- . More awareness and education are needed to inform the public that men , too , have a biological clock that can affect not only their partner 's pregnancy but also their future child 's health . Drug That May Extend Egg Viability Researchers at Princeton University studied a type of protein called cathepsin B proteases that is found in both humans and Caenorhabditis elegans worms . When they look at these proteins in worms , they found that cathepsin B appeared to be most common in the worm 's eggs that had begun to degrade with age -LRB- similar to how women 's egg quality starts to decline with age -RRB- , and less common in the healthier eggs that were more resistant to aging . The researchers then experimented with blocking the proteins halfway through the worm 's long reproductive window -LRB- which would be equivalent to the mid-thirties in humans -RRB- to determine how this would affect egg quality . They found that worms treated with the blocker drug had much less egg decline and more healthy eggs compared to the control worms who did n't receive the blocker drugs -LRB- Templeman et al. , 2018 -RRB- . Whether or not the findings are relevant to humans is not clear at this point , but it is a really interesting discovery . New Discovery for Male Infertility Researchers from the Imperial College of London presented research at the European Association of Urology Conference in 2019 that may revolutionize the way that we approach male infertility issues . The researchers analyzed the sperm of men who had previously undergone unsuccessful IVF as well as the sperm of fertile men , for comparison . The researchers found that the infertile men had much more sperm DNA damage than the fertile men in their ejaculate samples . But what was surprising is that when they analyzed the sperm pre-ejaculation , by taking samples from inside the men 's testes , they found that both the infertile and fertile men had similar sperm , without DNA damage . This study suggests that there may be something about the ejaculatory process that damages sperm and creates fertility problems in some men . This research is not yet published , but several other studies have previously shown that IVF using testicular sperm versus ejaculated sperm yields higher success rates -LRB- Esteves et al. , 2015 ; Mehta et al. , 2015 -RRB- . A clinical trial in New Jersey is recruiting couples with at least one failed IVF cycle to compare the efficacy of IVF with ejaculated versus testicular sperm . Bone Marrow Stem Cells One cause of infertility is primary ovarian insufficiency -LRB- POI -RRB- , in which a woman 's ovaries stop their normal functioning before the woman turns forty . POI is most commonly treated with hormone replacement therapy to supply the hormones that the ovaries are no longer making , which can help with symptoms but unfortunately does not restore ovarian function . However , researchers have recently discovered that some women with POI who have undergone bone marrow transplants for cancer treatment have had their fertility spontaneously restored . Why ? The theory is the ovaries may attract cells from other organs , such as bone marrow-derived stem cells , which help regenerate the ovaries . A study published in 2018 by researchers in Spain found that infusing bone-marrow-derived stem cells into mice with impaired ovaries restored their ovarian function by increasing ovarian follicles . And it increased the number of embryos and the number of healthy mice born . They also found that human ovarian tissue that was treated with these stem cells had increased follicle growth -LRB- Herraiz et al. , 2018 -RRB- . Following this study , researchers in India tested this stem cell therapy on a forty-five-year-old woman with POI with infrequent menstruation . The researchers successfully performed the treatment and the first healthy baby was born following bone-marrow-derived stem cell therapy -LRB- Gupta et al. , 2018 -RRB- . A phase 4 clinical trial in Spain will be recruiting to study bone marrow stem cell ovarian transplantation in women with POI . Spindle Nuclear Transfer In early 2019 , the first baby was born to three different parents in a clinical trial for infertility . Yes , you read that correctly . Using a novel -LRB- and controversial -RRB- technique called spindle nuclear transfer , researchers at the Institute of Life in Athens , Greece , combined the DNA of three different people : a thirty-two-year-old mother with a history of infertility , the father , and a female donor who provided an egg . The donor provided an egg , then researchers removed the nucleus of the egg , replacing it with the nucleus of the mother 's egg . The egg was fertilized with sperm from the father and the mother carried the pregnancy . The result ? A healthy baby with DNA from three different people -LRB- Institute of Life , 2019 -RRB- . While this is exciting , spindle nuclear transfer was initially meant for a different purpose : to avoid the passing down from mother to baby of fatal neurological disorders , such as Leigh syndrome , which causes genetic disruptions in the mitochondria of cells . Some experts argue that the potential risks of this therapy for the baby , which are largely unknown thus far , would be worth it only in extreme cases of neurological disorders , and that it 's not meant for women with infertility issues -LRB- Craven et al. , 2018 -RRB- . Clinical Trials for Infertility Clinical trials are research studies intended to evaluate a medical , surgical , or behavioral intervention . They are done so that researchers can study a particular treatment that may not have a lot of data on its safety or effectiveness yet . If you 're considering signing up for a clinical trial , it 's important to note that if you 're placed in the placebo group , you wo n't have access to the treatment being studied . It 's also good to understand the phase of the clinical trial : Phase 1 is the first time most drugs will be used in humans so it 's about finding a safe dose . If the drug makes it through the initial trial , it can be used in a larger phase 2 trial to see whether it works well . Then it may be compared to a known effective treatment in a phase 3 trial . If the drug is approved by the FDA , it will go on to a phase 4 trial . Phase 3 and phase 4 trials are the most likely to involve the most effective and safest up-and-coming treatments . In general , clinical trials may yield valuable information ; they may provide benefits for some subjects but have undesirable outcomes for others . Speak with your doctor about any clinical trial you are considering . Where Do You Find Studies That Are Recruiting Subjects ? You can find clinical studies that are recruiting subjects on clinicaltrials.gov , which is a website run by the US National Library of Medicine . The database consists of all privately and publicly funded studies that are happening around the globe . You can search by disease or a specific drug or treatment you 're interested in , and you can filter by country where the study is taking place . Uterine Transplant For women with uterine issues that prevent them from becoming pregnant -LRB- like endometriosis , polyps , birth defects , or scar tissue -RRB- , uterine transplantation is a new procedure that has been shown to have some success . In 2014 , a thirty-five-year-old Swedish woman gave birth after a uterine transplant from a sixty-one-year-old donor . Another baby was born to a woman who had undergone uterine transplant in the US in 2017 . However , the procedure is high risk as it involves organ transplantation in a particularly sensitive area , and it has failed several times in other women . Because of this , uterine transplant is done only in the context of clinical trials . Researchers at Brigham and Women 's Hospital will be recruiting women with Absolute Uterine Factor Infertility , who have either a malformed uterus or no uterus , to undergo a uterine transplant with the potential to undergo IVF treatment during the five-year follow up . The women 's uterus will be removed at the end of the study . Similar studies are ongoing at the Cleveland Clinic in Florida , Baylor Research Institute in Texas , and Imperial College of London for uterine transplantation . Sperm Selection Assay In an attempt to increase the success rate of ART , Laura Giojalas , PhD , the director of the Center of Cellular and Molecular Biology at the National University of Cordoba in Argentina , is recruiting couples with male infertility to undergo sperm selection assay -LRB- SSA -RRB- . SSA is an advanced technique that tests a sperm 's movement in response to an attractant molecule . SSA chooses the highest quality sperm with intact DNA , good motility , and viability that will have the highest chance of producing a healthy embryo . In the trial , after SSA , couples will undergo IVF , with the hope that SSA will improve fertilization and birth rate . Apps to Help Cope Meike Uhler , a physician at the Fertility Centers of Illinois , is studying a new mobile app for men with infertility called FertiStrong to complement the existing FertiCalm app for women . The app allows users to implement cognitive , behavioral , and social solutions to help with anxiety , depression , and stress . Participants will use the app for a month to determine whether it helps them cope through humor , relaxation , and self-nurturing . Both FertiStrong and FertiCalm can be found on Android and Apple phones for free . Walnuts for Male Infertility Howard Kim , a physician at Cedars-Sinai , and Wendie Robbins , RN , PhD , a professor at UCLA 's School of Nursing , are testing whether walnuts improve sperm quality . In a previous study , adding walnuts to a Western diet was shown to improve healthy young men 's sperm . So now the researchers are conducting a clinical trial to determine whether eating two ounces of walnuts per day for three months can help improve sperm quality in men who are seeking treatment at fertility centers .

Beach", "content": "Concord , N.H. -- The U.S. Supreme Court is leaving in place the public nudity convictions of three women who removed their bathing suit tops on a New Hampshire beach as part of a global campaign advocating for the rights of women to go topless . The justices declined last Monday to review a state court decision that found no violation of the women 's constitutional rights . Heidi Lilley , Kia Sinclair and Ginger Pierro are part of the Free the Nipple campaign , a global effort advocating for the rights of women to go topless . They were arrested in 2016 after removing their tops at a beach in Laconia and refusing to put them on when beachgoers complained . Pierro was doing yoga , while the two others were sunbathing . Dan Hynes , who represented the women , said he was disappointed . They are considering their next option , he said , including filing for relief in federal court and asking the New Hampshire legislature `` to make it clear that towns and cities lack the authority to create violations of law involving someone 's sex . '' `` The government should not be allowed to create a crime that requires proof of someone 's sex as an element of the offense , '' he said in a statement . `` It is unfortunate that 100 years after being granted the right to vote , the City of Laconia has decided to keep women second class citizens , with permission of the New Hampshire Supreme Court . '' In a 3-2 ruling last year , New Hampshire 's highest court upheld the conviction of the three women , finding their constitutional rights were not violated . The court decided that Laconia 's ordinance does not discriminate on the basis of gender or violate the women 's right to free speech . The Laconia law on indecent exposure bans sex and nudity in public but singles out women by prohibiting the `` showing of female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any part of the nipple . '' New Hampshire is just one of several places around the country where topless bans have been litigated . Supporters celebrated in February when the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a ruling blocking a Fort Collins , Colorado , law against women going topless in public .", "url": "https://www.omahadailyrecord.com/content/justices-turn-away-appeal-women-who-went-topless-nh-beach", "kws": ["topless^^bans", "N.H.", "Appeals", "federal^^court", "constitutional^^rights", "New^^Hampshire", "Women", "Concord", "Laconia", "law", "female^^breast", "campaign", "gender", "beachgoers", "violations", "free^^speech", "Ginger^^Pierro", "yoga", "Kia^^Sinclair", "Heidi^^Lilley"], "text_category": {}}

A In the 21st century , does Facebook ? The social media behemoth is in a well-publicized struggle to address hate speech , extremism , abuse and misinformation on its services - which together serve nearly 3 billion people worldwide . At the same time , it 's been retooling its policies on nudity . It 's tweaking its original heavy-handed policies to account for modern nuances around gender identity , political speech and self-expression , employing thousands of people and quickly evolving artificial intelligence for the task . But some of its users - including activists , sex therapists , abuse survivors , artists and sex educators - say policies at Facebook and its Instagram service are still too vague and unevenly enforced . They say their work is being unfairly censored , condemning them to `` Facebook jail '' with no warning and little , if any recourse . And it 's no small matter for them . Artists can be suddenly left without their audience , businesses without access to their customers and vulnerable people without a support network . And it means that a company in Silicon Valley , whose online platforms have become not only our town squares but diaries , magazines , art galleries and protest platforms , gets final say on matters of free speech and self-expression . It 's deciding what `` community standards '' should be for billions of people around the world . `` Instagram really is the magazine of the world right now . And if artists are being censored on Instagram it 's really dangerous for freedom of speech and openness when it comes to the body and art , '' said Spencer Tunick , a photographer known internationally for his shoots assembling masses of nude people . Tunick says that more recently he 's found his work `` shadow-banned '' by Instagram , which has become a crucial tool for artists to showcase their work . His post were n't removed but are n't readily visible to users . Of course , there 's near-universal agreement that child exploitation and nonconsensual images do n't belong on social networks . Pornography probably does n't either . Facebook 's monitoring systems do a better job with nudity than with hate speech , extremism and misinformation . After all , a butt is a butt and a nipple is a nipple . But deciding when a nipple is art , porn or protest gets murky even when humans are doing the deciding . Teaching AI software about human sexual desire is a whole other ballgame . From its start as a college photo directory and social network , Facebook banned nudity . Over the years , as Facebook 's audience grew bigger and more diverse , the ban loosened . The company instituted exceptions for breastfeeding women , for images of post-mastectomy scars . Birthing videos are now allowed , as are photos of post-gender reassignment surgery . `` We had this policy that said no genitals on the platform , '' said Kim Malfacini , the Facebook product policy manager who oversees how the company 's community standards are developed . `` Until two years ago there were no exceptions to that . '' But the reviewers began seeing photos and videos women shared about their childbirth , she said . Based on the letter of the policy , those had to be removed . Malfacini said she joined Facebook around this time and began speaking with midwives , doulas , birthing photographers and others to carve out an exception for images of childbirth even though they show genitalia . Now , the images come with a warning screen ; users can click through to see them . Most of the photos of unclothed children on Facebook are posted innocently by parents sharing vacation photos on the beach or kids in a bath . Sometimes these parents get a warning . Malfacini sometimes speaks to them .", "url": "https://www.wagmtv.com/content/news/Nudity-Debate-Brewing-on-Facebook-567039891.html", "kws": ["nudity", "Brewing", "Facebook", "Debate", "Instagram", "nude^^people", "social", "hate^^speech", "human^^sexual^^desire", "nude^^bodies", "Pornography", "breastfeeding^^women", "gender^^identity", "sex^^therapists", "social^^networks", "genitalia", "sex^^educators", "protest^^platforms", "post-mastectomy^^scars", "Birthing^^videos"], "text_category": {}}

Shok -- as the founder of MeUndies had become known in federal prison -- shook himself awake , pissed . The 29-year-old from Beverly Hills had gotten used to sleeping in a cell , but actual sleep was sometimes hard to come by , given that his bed was across the hall from the `` black TV room '' -LRB- as everyone called it -RRB- . Guys could get noisy in there . And on this morning , as the halls of the prison were still largely quiet , they were having a heated conversation about politics with the door wide open . So , scrawny as Shok had become behind bars , he got out of bed determined to shut their door -- even if it led to a confrontation . What he found , in the middle of that room , was an intimidating dude named Grease , who could n't have been less happy to see him -- and who , to both of their great surprise , would help define a new direction for MeUndies . But at that moment , nobody was talking business . The question was which one of them would end up on a stretcher . And really , it was n't much of a question . Where to start . SHOK / Zip Code 90210 In early 1985 , Jonathan Shokrian was born into a clutch of Persian Jews in Beverly Hills . Most had fled the 1979 revolution when Iran became Islamic , figuring they 'd go back when it all blew over . But Shokrian grew up sensing the struggle of a community that realized they were stuck here . `` There was a big identity crisis between the old world that our parents came from and this new world that we were living in , '' he says . `` I was told how I had to dress , who I could date . I was forced to take Farsi classes and groomed into taking over the family business . '' He had n't even graduated college at Southern Methodist University in Texas when he started working for his dad 's real estate company . But Shokrian found that business cutthroat and impersonal . At the same time , he compared himself to his childhood friends , who were doing amazing things . Escaping like a heady steam from their tiny pressure cooker of a Persian Jewish community , they 'd been launching some of the buzziest startups of the moment -- companies like FabFitFun , Alfred Coffee , and Sweetgreen . Shokrian could feel the intensity of their entrepreneurialism ; it pushed them not only to be part of this American culture but to define it . `` I had never been more excited by anything , '' he says . `` I started obsessively thinking about what my own thing could be . '' In 2011 , Shokrian was packing for a European vacation with Sweetgreen 's cofounder Jonathan Neman and ran to Macy 's to pick up a pair of underwear . There in Dallas 's Northpark mall , he was embarrassed to have to ask a female employee where the men 's underwear was . -LRB- `` I know it sounds silly , '' he says . -RRB- Then he dropped nearly $ 30 for a pair of Calvin Kleins that turned out to be a bad fit . On the trip , he vented about it . `` We were jetlagged , drinking coffee in a caf\u00e9 in Amsterdam , and Jon 's like , ` Someone should make underwear better and sell it online , ' '' says Neman . `` And then literally right there , he logs on to the internet and finds the guy who had UnderwearClub.com and offers him , like , $ 5,000 for the URL . That 's how Jon works . '' That deal fell through , and anyway , as they traveled , Shokrian decided that the name of his nascent underwear company should have more attitude . `` I personally struggled with body image and confidence , '' he says , `` and every ad I saw out there was so alienating , like you had to have a six-pack or wings on your back . '' He wanted to build a company that made everyone feel good in their skivvies , which meant the messaging had to be as comfortable as the fabric . He liked the cheeky way the English called their intimates `` undies , '' and because at the core the company would be about self-expression , Shokrian stuck the `` me '' in front . And there it was : MeUndies . Back home in L.A. , he found a student designer on Craigslist to sketch out prototypes . Then he set out to raise money . He 'd previously invested in his friends ' startups , so they now returned the favor . He also took money from a new incubator called Science , which was helping to build some of the biggest direct-to-consumer , subscription-based companies . Dollar Shave Club was starting there . So was DogVacay . Shokrian wanted MeUndies to run on a subscription model as well , which in theory would create recurring revenue while saving his customers from awkward trips to Macy 's . `` When Jonathan showed me his artwork , '' says Science cofounder Mike Jones , former CEO of MySpace , `` it was like this beautiful blend of a non-gender-conformity-building , modern , fresh approach . It felt like the anti -- Victoria 's Secret , the anti-Jockey . And that felt very next-generation . '' But Shokrian would n't be the star of Science . That honor went to Dollar Shave Club , which quickly exploded in popularity -LRB- and would later sell for $ 1 billion -RRB- . At MeUndies , six months after launching in December 2011 , Shokrian 's team of three was cramped in his father 's office , out of cash and pretty much out of inventory . He considered quitting but decided to give it one last shot , taking a loan from his dad to buy more product . That tided them over into the holidays and led MeUndies to its first $ 100,000 month . And on that momentum , Shokrian went on another fundraising tour and found some interest . `` The basics market was just stale , '' says Tyler Winklevoss , who 'd become an investor , `` and did n't speak to the modern consumer either in sensibility or purchasing channel . It was ready for a fresh newcomer . '' Shokrian raised $ 1 million and moved MeUndies into its own warehouse . As he relentlessly pushed to sell product , his tactics were sometimes at odds with his ambition to build a body-positive brand . `` Every major brand at the time used some form of sexualized content in order to drive attention , '' he says . `` In the early days , that 's all I knew . '' And so MeUndies hired seductive models to flaunt its underwear and even launched its socks on a new high-end porn site . `` Some of our early campaigns I 'm really proud of and others , you know , I 'm not , '' he admits . Say what you will , and people said a lot , the strategy tripled revenues . By 2013 , the team -- now around 10 strong -- was relieved to be over the hump . `` And then EPA agents showed up at my door , '' says Shokrian . `` They told me they were prosecuting me . '' GREASE / South Central L.A. . While Shokrian was growing up in one of the world 's fanciest neighborhoods , a boy named Joe Nickson was coming of age in South Central L.A. , infamous for gangs like the Neighborhood Crips and the Bloods , and crack . Nickson 's father managed logistics for a security company ; his mother worked as a home nurse . They split up when Nickson was about 6 but sent their son -- their only child together -- to school in suburban San Fernando Valley to keep him out of trouble . Nickson loved his classes but felt torn between two realities . `` I would go to different sleepovers , have different vernaculars , '' he says . `` I would hear about Tony Hawk in elementary school and when I went back home , the new Eazy-E and Snoop Dogg albums . I could relate to both worlds , but I never felt that I belonged to either . So in my adolescent years , I started acting out , just to try to reversely fit in . '' At 16 , he joined the Neighborhood Crips and started `` flocking . '' It worked like this : Nickson , who inherited the street name Grease because he was too slick to get caught , would set out with his crew , dressed like basketball players selling candy , or they 'd put on white shirts with black ties , get some pamphlets , and pretend to be Jehovah 's Witnesses . Then they 'd `` flock '' to wealthy parts of town like migrating birds and knock on doors . If no one was home , they 'd break in . It all ended rather abruptly , he says , when one of the houses they burglarized belonged to a district attorney . The laptop Nickson stole had a tracker in it . Nickson was sent to fire camp , an alternative to prison for first-time offenders . He was there only a few months . On the day he returned back home , a member of the Bloods pulled up in front of him in a Camaro , rolled down the window , and tossed out an envelope . `` When you ready to get some money , come holler at me , '' the man said . The envelope contained $ 5,000 in cash . Nickson hollered and was soon robbing banks . In four months , his crew hit more than 10 . `` We got out of hand , '' he says . But one time really sticks with him : He was masked and armed , heisting a Bank of America on March 12 , 2001 . He 'd already stuffed his long johns with cash and was heading away from a sign that said , of all things : `` Easier Access : What are you waiting for ? '' Then , a kid -- maybe 4 years old -- popped up out of nowhere . `` He runs up to me and he puts his hand like mocking a gun and he says , ` Freeze ! ' '' Nickson recalls . `` And I say , ` Little man , where 's your mommy ? ' And she says , ` I 'm right here . ' '' Nickson grabbed the boy by the hand and brought him to his mother . This was the first time he really thought about the people he victimized . And he said to himself , I 'm not supposed to be doing this . He quit hitting banks , but the police still caught up with him . Nickson was convicted of conspiracy and bank robbery and took a plea on three additional bank robberies . On June 6 , 2005 , he was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison . He was 25 . SHOK / Dallas Shokrian 's run-in with the feds -- the reason the EPA showed up at his door -- went back to a critical mistake he made when he was 23 . Before starting MeUndies , when he was working for his father , he convinced his dad to buy and fix up a huge , run-down 1950s shopping center called Fazio 's . The place was a wreck -- rats , holes in the roof , buckled floor tiles , asbestos allegedly in the glue holding them together . Some forms of asbestos are unregulated and do n't require the full , heavily controlled -LRB- and expensive -RRB- removal process . Shokrian 's construction consultant , according to court records , said the building contained this kind of asbestos . So , eager to make his dad proud and get the place renovated quickly , Shokrian outfitted his workers with masks and respirators , and went about renovations . But the project made news when workers used gasoline to clean the tiles , which caught the attention of the EPA . The agency decided to investigate and determined that the asbestos did need to be removed according to regulations . `` I tried to tell them it was an honest mistake , '' says Shokrian , `` and that I would never intentionally put someone in harm 's way . '' The Shokrians paid a $ 500,000 fine , took asbestos removal training , and started monitoring the workers for health issues . And everybody moved on . Except that , four years later , out of the blue , the case came back . After the agents showed up at Shokrian 's door , he was accused of failure to notify under the Clean Air Act . `` I never thought a judge in his right mind would send me to jail , '' says Shokrian . But that 's what happened . `` This was not a case in which -LSB- Shokrian -RSB- set about to injure the environment , '' Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater said at his sentencing hearing in Dallas . But the law is the law : He sentenced Shokrian to federal prison for a year and a day . The founder of MeUndies had 45 days to self-surrender . `` We were shocked , '' says Neman , the Sweetgreen cofounder , who flew in for support along with others . `` It felt like a final supper . '' GREASE and SHOK / Terminal Island Nickson was 12 years into his sentence and doing time at Terminal Island , in L.A. 's harbor -- transferred to the minimum-security facility for good behavior -- when Jonathan Shokrian showed up there to begin his own imprisonment . It was April 15 , 2014 . Shokrian had left MeUndies in good hands . He 'd chosen a CEO to run the business and had taken his team out to dinner to buoy their spirits . He knew that , as a federal prisoner , he 'd be prohibited from conducting business while incarcerated , but he planned to stay in as close touch as he could . At the office , the MeUndies staff set up a special Golden Eagle Trimstyle phone -- red for drama -- just for when Shokrian called . `` I felt very confident the company would survive my absence , '' he says . His own survival felt less certain . `` I was scared , '' he says . `` I mean , I 'm from this very sheltered Jewish Persian family in Beverly Hills . '' He hired a prison consultant -LRB- an actual thing -RRB- , who prepped him on how to stay out of trouble . And once inside , that 's what Shokrian did . The other inmates started calling him Shok , and he kept focused on journaling daily , reading , and , as soon as he could get sneakers , running 50 miles a week . Shok thought a lot about MeUndies and was frustrated by not being able to contribute more . He could send emails via the prison-monitored CorrLinks and make limited calls , but he had to be careful . `` I was able to make suggestions and get updates , '' he says . `` But there was this very , very fine line I had to walk . '' Shok 's first-ever hire , Noah Taubman , came regularly to the visitors room , with its sad vending machines . `` Jon would always show up with a piece of paper and go , ` How 's this going ? How 's that going ? ' '' says Taubman , senior project manager . `` He would have us print out the MeUndies Instagram feed and mail it to him , then go through it and comment and mail it back . It was surreal to see his complete reversal . He always wanted to control everything , and he had controlled everything . Now he was in an off-white jumpsuit , three sizes too big . His hair was short . He had lost a crap-ton of weight . That was scary . '' But then , one fateful early morning , Shok said , Screw it . He 'd had enough . The TV Room Terminal Island is home to some 1,150 inmates , and , as is common in prison , they tend to divide themselves by race . Shok 's bed was across the hall from a TV room used by black men -- `` like a barbershop , '' as Nickson describes it , where the guys would hang out and converse . And they kept the door open so it would n't get too hot . `` So one day around 7 o'clock , '' Nickson says , `` Mr. Privileged comes in , looks around , and closes the door . '' Mr. Privileged was , of course , Shok . And Nickson -- or Grease to everyone in prison -- reopened the door . From there , the men forget exactly how they nearly came to blows . Grease : `` I already have it in my mind that if he closes -LSB- the door -RSB- again , I 'm going to smash the collarbone off his shoulders . Can you believe what his first words to me are ? ` All I hear is your fucking mouth . ' '' Shok : `` Well , no . He said , ` If you touch the door one more time , you little punk-ass bitch , it 'll be the last door you touch . ' And then I was like , ` I would n't be touching the door if I did n't have to hear your loud-ass mouth . ' '' Grease : `` And as sure as the sun came up , he came in and attempted to -LSB- close the door -RSB- again . '' Shok : `` I forgot where I was . I mean this guy 's like six feet and ripped . I 'm like five nine , a skinny Jewish kid , and he 's about to knock me out . '' Grease : `` I was going to beat the -- oh , yes , I was . And then one of the other guys , said , ` Hey , man , come on . ' '' Shok apologized , and the two ate dinner together that night . `` The connection , '' says Grease , `` was instantaneous . '' After that , they started walking the track , working out , and making special meals together . They talked about life , family , and integrity . If the two had led impossibly different lives , they shared a sense of being torn between worlds . Shok wanted to understand how a guy as smart as Grease was robbing banks . Grease wanted to know everything about MeUndies . `` Grease 's energy was beyond anything I had seen , '' says Shok . `` He was passionate , full of life and ideas , resourceful . He was always laughing . We were very , very close . '' One day Grease came racing from the TV room with news about a Dallas Cowboys running back , telling Shok , `` Joseph Randle just got arrested for stealing underwear from Dillard 's . You have to do something with it . '' Grease had a point ; the player could have just bought underwear online ! It played right into the MeUndies brand story . Back at HQ , the red phone rang . Greg Fass , senior brand manager , picked it up . `` Jon was like , ` We 've got to reach out . We 've got to get involved in the conversation , ' '' he says . So they jumped on it . Adam Schefter , NFL insider at ESPN , was tweeting about how expensive Randle 's stolen underwear was , considering the fine the Cowboys organization was about to slap him with . So using the MeUndies Twitter account , Fass tweeted back : `` @AdamSchefter if you see him , tell Joseph Randle that we 'll pay his fine . We hate buying underwear from dept stores too #DirectToConsumer . '' Schefter responded by putting them in touch with Randle 's people . MeUndies worked out an endorsement deal where it would help cover the $ 29,500 fine in return for Randle doing charitable appearances and donating $ 15,000 in underwear to those in need . Back in prison , Grease and Shok ran to the nearest TV to watch their stunt unfold on the news . `` I had to get him an honorary seat in the black TV room , '' says Grease . Then they saw it , right there on the screen -- Grease 's idea , transported from behind bars and out into the world . It was nothing short of an awakening . `` When I was robbing banks , I was doing it for the adrenaline rush , '' he says . `` This was that feeling times 10 . I thought : This is euphoria . This is what I want to do for the rest of my life . '' The Randle story quickly went viral . In the crush of media , MeUndies got slammed for sponsoring a thief . -LRB- And as it turns out , Randle has gotten in repeated trouble since . -RRB- But Shokrian leaned into the controversy . If MeUndies was under fire , it was also in the spotlight , and the team responded by emphasizing the charitable outcome . `` It really proved to me the power of timing and going live with something that 's socially relevant , '' he says . He also saw Grease 's potential and encouraged him to come up with more ideas for MeUndies . `` Jon told me , ` Bro , you got it , ' '' says Grease . Three months later , Grease spotted another opportunity on the news . With the Super Bowl approaching , Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch was fined for grabbing his crotch . Grease and Shok knew Lynch 's cousin from prison , and he got them an intro to the athlete . MeUndies announced it would donate $ 20,000 to Lynch 's charity to cover the fine plus $ 20,000 for every touchdown he scored at the big game . They ended up spending $ 40,000 total -- a pittance for Super Bowl exposure . `` Those two campaigns , '' says Shokrian , `` put us on the map . '' SHOK / MeUndies HQ November 3 , 2014 , after 202 days inside , Shokrian walked out of Terminal Island , released five months early . His entire family was there to greet him . They gave him his cellphone , which had been off since April 15 , and took him home , where he changed out of his prison sweats and had breakfast with some old buddies . A few days later , he was back at work . The transition was easy , he says . Shokrian had stayed connected to everyone while locked up and even shared his journals with some of them , so there was n't much catching up to do . But he did carry a new lesson with him , hard-learned from the asbestos fiasco : He needed to think through decisions more carefully and get good expertise . `` It 's on me to do the diligence and to slow down , '' he says . `` Now I go into everything asking as many questions as I can , so I feel confident in the decision we 're making . '' This would filter into MeUndies at large . `` It was n't like Moses came down and gave us the new values of the company , '' says Taubman . But employees did notice a subtle shift . During MeUndies ' first years , Shokrian myopically followed competitors into sexy marketing and a lot of unoriginal branding . Now , says Taubman , Shokrian started thinking differently : `` We ca n't just be another brand that does the same thing , that has the same photo shoot , that pays the same influencers . It was like he was given the thumbs-up to do things another way . It was very slight but powerful . '' Shortly after Shokrian got out of prison , MeUndies partnered with the edgy digital media platform Arsenic -- but when he saw the sexual content it was planning , he pulled out of the deal . From then on , MeUndies stopped going for the quick clicks . The company came out in support of the LGBTQ community and partnered with restaurateur Eddie Huang , who stood in front of the camera in just his MeUndies and talked about body insecurity among Asian men . In August 2019 , the brand launched Feel Free , a range of larger sizes -- and then , `` because maybe even they wo n't fit , and someone will be left out , '' Shokrian says , they added a button for people who need more room . The button makes no financial sense , but it 's a show of commitment to inclusion . The formula seems to be working . In January 2019 , Shokrian took back his role as CEO and has grown the company to 250 employees . It anticipates $ 100 million in sales for 2020 . MeUndies ' model also seems to be paying off . The underwear-and-socks category overall has n't grown in the past year , but the shift to online purchases is profound -- an increase in the U.S. of 9 percent , to $ 5.2 billion , during the year ending September 2019 , according to The NPD Group . And MeUndies is moving offline , too . In November , it opened its second brick-and-mortar store -- this one in the Del Amo Fashion Center , which is owned by Simon Property Group , the real estate giant whose venture arm invested in MeUndies . -LRB- It has raised almost $ 11 million . -RRB- `` So there is definitely a very big strategic partnership there as we look to expand and open more stores , '' says Shokrian . GREASE / On the Outside When Shokrian left Terminal Island , he gave Nickson a note that said : Always stay positive and evolve , learn , and grow . `` That shit was so profound , '' says Nickson now . The two men talked often in the years that followed . Then , on July 15 , 2019 , after 17 years in prison , Nickson was released . He breathed in the fresh air , and a lady friend picked him up from the facility . A job was waiting for him at MeUndies . He 'd learn the product in the warehouse and then move into a marketing role . But it 's not so easy , both men say , to walk away from a criminal past . For Shokrian , having a record as a convicted felon has meant often explaining the case to new acquaintances or potential partners . `` That has definitely impacted me and our business , '' he says . And for Nickson , it 's meant that every part of his new life is an adjustment -- and the structured environment at MeUndies , it turned out , just was n't an easy fit . Less than five months after Nickson joined the company , they parted ways . No hard feelings . `` That 's my friend forever , '' explains Nickson . `` I 've got a lot of love for him , '' says Shokrian . Both , in fact , look forward to the next chapter of the story that is still unfolding . `` From the Jonathans to the -- I mean , the way we met and the friendship that spun from it , '' says Nickson . `` They have a saying that we make plans and God laughs . This is my destiny . '' Another friend of his from Terminal Island , Vincent Bragg , had seen how Nickson 's ideas helped MeUndies -- so when Bragg got out in 2016 , he cofounded ConCreates , a marketing agency that crowdsources ideas from people currently incarcerated or affected by the system . To whatever extent good marketing is essentially a con job , there 's a voracious thirst for erupting originality , and ConCreates has already secured a partnership with global agency 72andSunny . Now Nickson works with them , too . Shokrian , meanwhile , is grateful for the perspective he found in prison -- one that , he believes , will continue to shape his company in the future . `` Although I wish it did n't happen , '' he says , `` it 's not something I would want to take back . Considering no one got hurt , I 'm grateful for the tough lessons it gave me . There 's still an opportunity , no matter who you are , to turn a negative into a positive .

After returning home from her recent getaway , the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star , 39 , rolled out a series of sultry swimsuit photos from the trip on Instagram . She simply captioned the slideshow of pics : `` Cabo . '' In one photo , Kardashian West kneels on the sand with her backside facing the camera to give a hint of her sand-covered butt in the burnt orange , high-rise one-piece bathing suit . Wearing her hair in a super long braid that dropped all the way down to the sand , the star also accessorized with rectangular sunglasses and chunky gold drop earrings . Kardashian West took another photo , laying back in the sand to reveal the plunging neckline and front stomach cutout on the one-piece . The final photo showed the star staring out at the sea and flaunting her butt in the cheeky swimsuit . The sexy photos got sister Kylie Jenner ` s stamp-of-approval , who commented a fire `` '' emoji on the Instagram post . Earlier this week , Kardashian West posted another swimsuit photo on Instagram -- this time wearing a bubblegum pink string bikini -- from inside her closet as she was packing . Her vacation modeling session comes shortly after the fashion and beauty mogul opened up about cutting back the number of sexy pics she shares on social media . `` I guess I just do n't care as much anymore to want to take tons of photos in a thong bikini , '' Kardashian West said in a November interview with New York magazine . `` I think I 'm evolving to where I do n't feel the need to want to keep up .

Nicole Flaherty filed the lawsuit against the Norwell Police Department last September after filing a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination a year earlier . In the lawsuit , Flaherty said former Sgt. Ronald Fries would touch her lower back , requiring her to use an `` arm-bar '' technique to get away from him , would touch her hair and say `` nice bun '' and would touch her ear and blow into it . Fries ' behavior , coupled with alleged retaliation and inaction by others in the Norwell Police Department , constituted a violation of her rights , Flaherty said in the lawsuit . `` Plaintiff did not welcome said sexually harassing conduct and , to the contrary , advised Fries that such conduct was unwelcome , '' according to the lawsuit . Flaherty is asking for $ 50,000 in future medical expenses , $ 2.1 million in anticipated lost wages and $ 2 million in `` general and special damages , '' including compensatory damages and punitive damages . Norwell Police Chief Ted Ross declined to comment on the lawsuit and did not respond to questions about whether the department investigated Flaherty 's complaints . Payroll records obtained by The Patriot Ledger indicate that Fries retired in July 2018 , two months before Flaherty filed her complaint with the Commission Against Discrimination . Fries could not be reached for comment . He was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit . Flaherty 's lawsuit outlines a series of ways that she says Fries harassed and humiliated her during her time with the department . She said the sergeant sent her sexually themed messages , including explicit emojis , such as a yellow face with arms grabbing breasts and emojis in lace underwear . She said he told Flaherty about sexual dreams involving her and asked her if she lost weight because her `` ass looks smaller . '' She said said Fries also referred to Flaherty as a `` chole , '' a slang term for a woman whom men want to have sex with , and wrote inappropriate messages in the snow on the back of her car . Flaherty said Fries attacked her during a training event by placing his legs around her as she walked down the aisle toward her seat , which was directly in front of his chair , and would not let her go . During the same training , she said he came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her body and breasts in front of officers from different communities , which she said was humiliating . Flaherty said Fries ' harassment affected her psychological well-being , created a hostile and humiliating work environment and `` unreasonably interfered '' with her ability to be a police officer . According to the lawsuit , as a direct result of her complaints and `` action '' involving Fries ' alleged behavior and the police department 's response , she was `` subject to unlawful retaliation by the NPD . '' She said she received `` adverse treatment in scheduling , '' lost overtime opportunities and suffered `` other adverse treatment regarding terms and conditions of employment . '' She said she experienced `` extreme emotional distress '' and was forced to resign . Flaherty 's attorney , Peter Perroni , declined to comment except to say that the lawsuit speaks for itself . He would not comment on Flaherty 's current employment status . She is listed on the Norwell Police Department 's online roster . According to the lawsuit , Flaherty started as a part-time clerk in 2015 when she was 23 . By 2016 , she was a full-time officer . According to the Norwell Police Department 's website , Fries was one of its four instructors in a `` rape aggression defense '' course . In an answer to the complaint , attorneys for the town argued that the town is not responsible for the people who caused Flaherty 's injuries , that the `` decisions challenged in the complaint '' were justified by legitimate , non-retaliatory reasons and that Flaherty failed to file her claim within the Commission Against Discrimination 's statute of limitations .", "url": "https://www.wickedlocal.com/news/20200116/female-officer-alleges-norwell-police-ignored-harassment-complaints", "kws": ["Norwell^^Police", "unlawful^^retaliation", "officer", "Police^^Chief", "Discrimination", "Plaintiff", "conduct", "attorneys", "punitive^^damages", "inappropriate^^messages", "sex", "Nicole^^Flaherty", "Massachusetts", "compensatory^^damages", "men", "Payroll^^records", "medical^^expenses", "employment", "adverse^^treatment", "sexual^^dreams"], "text_category": {}}

On Wednesday , the `` Rock Hall '' -LRB- as the cool kids call it -RRB- announced the list of inductees for 2020 , a reveal that never fails to get music fans far too fired up about who should and should n't be bestowed with a supposedly high honor a lot of major artists seem pretty ambivalent about receiving . This year 's inductees represent a diverse array of musical styles -LRB- I know it 's the `` Rock and Roll '' Hall of Fame but that 's a discussion for another day -RRB- , with the newest class consisting of the Doobie Brothers , Whitney Houston , Nine Inch Nails , Notorious B.I.G. , Depeche Mode , and T. Rex If we 're using social media as a barometer to gauge outrage , it would appear this year 's biggest snub was Dave Matthews Band , which won the fan vote but failed to get the nod -LRB- it 's perhaps then apt that the Doobie Brothers did because you honestly had to be a fool to believe DMB ever had a shot -RRB- . Now , fans of the greatest jam band to ever come out of Charlottesville can find solidarity among the followers of the many other musical acts that have n't been recognized and prepare for an existence that involves getting their hopes up year after year only to be repeatedly let down and left pondering one of life 's ' great existential questions : `` WTF ? '' The internet is littered with articles penned by people begging the Hall to consider paying tribute to the artists they feel have gotten snubbed , and now , I 'd like to throw another list of submissions on that `` For Your Consideration '' pile by making the argument for six bands who need to get the respect they deserve sooner rather than later . Mot\u00f6rhead As I alluded to before , the Hall of Fame has veered slightly off course as far as the whole `` Rock and Roll '' thing is concerned , but even though the definition has become increasingly fluid , it 's egregious that a band fronted by Lemmy Kilmister -- the man who embodied rock better than anyone to come before or after him -- is n't currently enshrined . Mot\u00f6rhead 's original audience may be getting up there in age but the band also holds a special place in the heart of a younger crowd that was introduced to proto-thrash metal courtesy of their 1980 hit `` Ace of Spades '' because it served as the soundtrack to many a gnarly grind sesh on Tony Hawk 's Pro Skater 3 . Mot\u00f6rhead laid the groundwork for thrash metal titans like Slayer and Metallica , the latter of which happily road the band 's coattails into the Hall . That influence alone should be enough to give Lenny and crew the credit they deserve and I eagerly await the day I can raise a Jack and Coke to commemorate the occasion . Soundgarden The quartet fronted by the tragically late Chris Cornell was on the ballot this year but did n't ultimately make the cut . In order to be eligible for the Hall of Fame , 25 years must have passed since the release of an act 's first album , which means that we should be seeing a slew of grunge-era artists making their way to Cleveland in the immediate future . Nirvana ushered in the new guard by getting enshrined in 2014 before being joined by Pearl Jam in 2017 and I 'd love to hear anyone argue Soundgarden does n't deserve to be next in line -LRB- aside from the dozens of fans Alice in Chains still has left who would likely beg to differ -RRB- . Cornell 's vocal abilities alone should be enough to secure an induction , but when you couple that with plenty of hit tunes and a copious amount of album sales , they should be a shoo-in at some point over the next few years . Judas Priest Sometimes a solid track record of hits , record sales , and a towering influence on the sound -- and even the look -- of an entire genre is n't even enough to secure a spot in Cleveland . Such is the case for Judas Priest . For the life of me , I really ca n't think of a reason why Priest has n't seen an induction after all these years . Hell , the English metallers still tour and release music to this day . While the lineup has seen a few changes thanks to Father Time , founding member and bassist Ian Hill is still going strong and the same can be said for the Metal God who is Rob Halford . Priest has put out plenty of hits over the years , including the likes of `` Living After Midnight '' and `` Breakin ' The Law . '' They all feature ferocious twin guitars and stunning vocals from Halford , who is still capable of hitting notes that only dogs can hear . The band is also credited with creating the look of heavy metal that became defined by excessive leather , gleaming studs , and all of the other fixings , which is something I feel should be enough to earn them a one-way ticket to enshrinement . Alas , it is not , but I 'm not sure what else they need to do to improve their case . Blink-182 With the 25-year waiting period in mind , we will soon be entering the era of pop-punk . With Green Day already in the Hall of Fame , it then only makes sense that the genre 's next representative would be Blink-182 . Few bands of that era have been able to maintain such a consistent level of popularity and they 're still going strong despite the departure of lead singer and noted ufologist Tom DeLonge , who boldly pivoted to a career in alien hunting in 2015 before having to deal with the absurd amount of debt he was rewarded with for making that decision . Blink-182 's music served as a soundtrack to adolescent angst in the late-90s and early-aughts , with catchy hooks , great riffs , and a strong rhythm section comprised of bassist Mark Hoppus and the superhuman drumming of Travis Barker coming together to create some classic jams . I do n't know how long we 'll have to wait for them to get in but I do know I hope they 'll wear as much hair gel to their induction as they did in the picture above . M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce could be the most interesting candidate that still has n't gotten into the Hall of Fame . While the notorious quartet has a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that should speak for itself , it will likely be their resurgence in popularity over the last year or so that will be the tipping point . Without a doubt the biggest band to come out of the Sunset Strip back in the early-80s , Cr\u00fce 's string of hit songs and reputation as some of the biggest partiers the rock world has ever seen turned them into icons of the hair metal world . M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce signed what in retrospect was n't a very legally binding `` cessation of touring '' contract back in 2014 and they 'll be taking advantage of its largely unenforceable nature by hitting the road in 2020 , where they 'll be headlining stadiums yet again . This is in no doubt due in part to the success of the film adaptation of the band 's memoir The Dirt , which received considerable acclaim -LRB- as well as some derision from people who really like describing things as `` problematic '' -RRB- . With their name back in the collective brains of the public , it seems to be a safe bet that M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce will be delivering induction speeches in Cleveland sometime in the next few years . Iron Maiden Full disclosure : I love Iron Maiden more than I love most things in life . One time , I took a copy of the band 's 1984 release Powerslave to an English class during my senior year of high school and made my teacher play `` The Rime of The Ancient Mariner '' as a companion to my class 's study of English poet -LRB- and big-time opium fan -RRB- Samuel Taylor Coleridge . Yeah , I was the coolest . But my own inherent biases aside , Maiden should still be in that goddamn Hall of Fame . Hailing from London , Iron Maiden was at the forefront of the new wave of British heavy metal that took the world by storm in the early '80s . It 's been 40 years since the release of their first album , but the band -- along with Eddie , their ever-present zombie/cyborg/monster mascot -- continues to perform for sellout crowds in arenas and soccer stadiums around the world . If you 'll allow me to briefly get my Patrick Bateman on , I 'd argue their most important album is 1982 's The Number of the Beast , which is a great record from start to finish with a searing title track perfect for drawing the ire of conservative parents that cemented -LRB- then-new -RRB- lead singer Bruce Dickinson as perhaps the greatest vocalist in metal history . When you combine Dickinson 's `` Air Raid Siren '' shriek with the fleet-fingered gallop of Steve Harris , the thunderous drumming of Nicko McBrain , and the three-headed guitar monster comprised of Dave Murray , Adrian Smith , and Janick Gers , you have all of the makings of a band that deserves to belong in the Hall . I defy you to find any metal band that does n't see Maiden as an influence in one way or another . They certainly did n't create the genre but they damn near perfected it , and for that , they deserve a place among the rest of the greats .", "url": "https://brobible.com/culture/article/snubbed-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-bands/", "kws": ["Hall^^Of^^Fame", "Rock^^And^^Roll", "music^^fans", "inductees", "bands", "musical^^styles", "Dave^^Matthews^^Band", "touring", "Pearl^^Jam", "lead^^singer", "Metallica", "fans^^Alice", "induction^^speeches", "Blink-182", "icons", "catchy^^hooks", "Nirvana", "stunning^^vocals", "ferocious^^twin^^guitars", "hits"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Music": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Music_Rock": 1.0000100135803223}}}
0.0	{"docid": "0NrUaGir", "title": "The California Sunday Magazine", "content": "On the morning of June 22 , 2007 , when officers from the Victoria Police arrived at Faruk Orman 's suburban Melbourne home to arrest him for murder , he promptly asked to speak to his attorney . Orman was no stranger to legal trouble , and he happened to have a lawyer 's cell number handy . Not just any lawyer , but one of the preeminent defense attorneys in the city , a swashbuckling criminal barrister named Nicola Gobbo . She was , as one newspaper described her , `` almost as big a celebrity as the gangland toughs she represented , '' a figure alternately cherished and loathed for her ability to argue her clients out of seemingly dead-end charges . The veteran investigator handling Orman 's arrest , Boris Buick , saw no reason to dissuade Orman from placing the call . `` It was his request , not my decision or instigation , '' Buick testified at a 2019 public hearing . Buick acknowledged that with the benefit of hindsight , he could see that he 'd held `` a na\u00efve view '' of the call 's implications . The call went to voicemail . Orman then phoned a solicitor who sometimes worked with Gobbo . -LRB- Under the Australian justice system , solicitors are generally the attorneys who handle client relations ; barristers like Gobbo are those who make arguments in court . -RRB- The 25-year-old Orman had never faced an accusation as serious as murder . His past scrapes with the law included a punch-up at a bar , a shooting in which no one was hurt and he was acquitted , and a conviction for heroin possession . He 'd never spent time in prison , partly due to the efforts of Nicola Gobbo . But for years , he 'd associated with some of the most feared underworld figures in Melbourne . Many of them had also been represented by Gobbo . The murder Orman was charged with occurred on the night of May 1 , 2002 . According to police , at around 9:10 p.m. , a notorious Australian criminal named Victor Peirce was sitting in a parked car outside a mobile-phone shop in Port Melbourne , along the city 's southern waterfront . -LRB- Peirce and his family 's life would later inspire the film and TV series Animal Kingdom . -RRB- A stolen blue-gray Holden Commodore pulled up beside him . A hit man named Benji Veniamin jumped out , approached the car , and shot Peirce three times through the driver 's side window . At the wheel of the Commodore , the police alleged , was Faruk Orman . By the time they 'd gathered the evidence to make arrests , five years had passed and Veniamin himself had been killed . The weight of the prosecution would land on Orman . But first , the police tried to use the murder charge to convince him to talk . For years , Orman had been associated with an underworld figure named Domenic `` Mick '' Gatto , a former heavyweight boxer who ran illegal gambling rackets , a mediation business , and -- police believed , but could never prove -- more-sinister operations . The prosecutors offered Orman a deal if he was willing to roll on his boss , implicating him in a crime . Orman declined ; Gatto , as it happened , was raising money for Orman 's defense . The state 's corrections department proceeded to place Orman in solitary confinement while he awaited trial . He would remain there for three years , spiraling into depression as the case dragged on . Nicola Gobbo joined Orman 's defense team , largely working in the background on legal strategy . She appeared several times for him in court , at hearings in which she tried unsuccessfully to subpoena information and documents about police witnesses . Nonetheless , Orman had a strong defense . There was no evidence placing him at the murder scene . All that linked him to the stolen Commodore was a ping from his cellphone , within a few hours after the murder , to a tower near where police found the burned getaway vehicle . When the case finally went to trial , in 2009 , the prosecution hinged almost entirely on a single witness : a drug trafficker and convicted triple murderer already in prison . The witness , a friend of Veniamin 's who sometimes took him along to drug deals as an enforcer , told police that Veniamin and Orman had confessed to him . On its face , the witness 's testimony appeared surmountable . He had minimal contact with Orman , and his statements seemed to diverge from the forensics of the crime scene . There was little evidence to corroborate his account , which had shifted over time in multiple statements to police . What 's more , in exchange for his testimony , prosecutors had agreed to request that the witness be sentenced on just one of his three murder convictions . After Orman 's seven-week trial , however , the jury found the witness credible . A judge sentenced Orman to 20 years in the state 's maximum-security prison , 14 of them without the possibility of parole . Orman faced still greater legal peril . In the years he awaited trial , the police had charged him as the getaway driver in another murder , again based primarily on the witness 's claims . This time , Orman had a new defense team , minus Gobbo , and they won the right to subpoena documents held by the police . On the eve of trial in 2013 , the prosecutor suddenly dropped the charges . By that point , Orman had exhausted all of his appeals in the Peirce conviction . One of his appellate attorneys , Ruth Parker , moved his files into a safe in her office . `` I never destroyed anything , even though we only had to keep files for seven years , '' she told me at a seaside caf\u00e9 a few miles from where Victor Peirce was killed . `` Faruk 's matter haunted me . Because I knew something wrong had happened . '' Even if new evidence somehow emerged , the Australian court system would offer Orman no clear recourse . Still , Parker thought , `` someday , something will come out about this . '' D David Abramson * remembers precisely where he met Nicola Gobbo , even if he 's a little hazy on when . `` 1996 or 1997 , I 'm not quite sure , '' he said one morning last November in Melbourne . We were sitting at a conference table surrounded by boxes in his law firm 's office in the Central Business District . Abramson , who has waves of silver hair , exuded the impish charm of a man known for his colorful legal career . We were meeting on Melbourne Cup Day , the holiday celebrating Australia 's biggest horse race . But he 'd recently sold the building that housed his firm and had skipped the day 's festivities to sort through two decades of accumulated files . `` You normally advise the clients that you 've kept the files for seven years , '' he said , in an Australian accent tinged with his native Russian . `` Perhaps longer for matters that may or may not become controversial in the future . '' The trouble , he added , is knowing what `` might become important 20 years from now . '' Twenty years earlier , Abramson was running his then-fledgling firm from a Melbourne suburb , taking on a hodgepodge of real estate and criminal cases . That day in \u201996 or ' 97 , visiting another firm 's office to negotiate a settlement , he was approached by a young woman . `` Are you David Abramson ? '' she asked . `` Yes ? '' he replied . The woman introduced herself as Nicola , a law clerk just out of school , and explained that she was interested in criminal defense . `` I do commercial work here , and it bores me stiff , '' she said . `` Do you have an opening ? '' Abramson suggested she come by for a chat . Only when Gobbo handed over her CV did he realize , `` Oh gosh , she 's one of the Gobbo clan , '' he told me . The Gobbos were legal royalty in the state of Victoria : Nicola 's uncle , Sir James Gobbo , had been an acclaimed barrister and a long-serving judge on Victoria 's Supreme Court . In 1997 , Queen Elizabeth appointed him governor of Victoria , representing the Crown 's interests in the state . Nicola , one of five siblings born to a nurse and a local government official , was raised middle class and attended a Catholic school . She 'd excelled , but her high school tenure was disrupted by her mother 's and then her father 's diagnoses of lymphoma . Her mother recovered , but her father died , in May 1990 , just before Gobbo earned a spot in the University of Melbourne 's law program . She 'd wanted to become a lawyer since childhood , she later wrote in her bar application , `` having been instilled with a strong sense of social justice in a family with an established legal background . '' As Abramson could see on her CV , she was ambitious and accomplished , elected as editor of the university 's newspaper and vice president of the Law Students ' Society . Gobbo was open with him about the one black mark on her record : a 1993 arrest for drug possession while she was in law school . `` I thought : student , drugs , cannabis -- I was told it was cannabis -- and you are older , wiser , '' he recounted to me , shrugging . He decided to let it pass and offered her a one-month provisional position . She had little criminal-law experience but was eager to learn . `` I realized she 's very quick , highly intelligent , perceptive , '' he said . She was also a relentless worker , staying at the office late , even as Abramson insisted that her salary was n't based on hours . Before the month was up , he offered her a job . Soon he was giving her a share of the firm 's criminal work -- small tasks , like motion hearings -- without supervision . Gobbo had a talent for courtroom arguments , but outside of court , she seemed to personalize cases in ways that , to Abramson , could seem intemperate . `` She had a hatred of police . It was unbelievable , '' he said . To Gobbo , all officers seemed to be either incompetent or corrupt . `` She would say , ` Well , this cocksucker is useless . He 's as dumb as shit and a liar , ' '' Abramson said . `` Obviously , I have no love for corrupt coppers , but you have to live with them . '' As Abramson watched Gobbo 's legal talent blossom , he also grew concerned about her interactions with defendants . Her professional relationships seemed to easily bleed into social ones , including coffees and drinks with the firm 's clientele , which included major players in the city 's drug trade . `` I said to her , ` Do n't come too close to them , ' '' Abramson remembered . `` ` You 'll get yourself burned . ' '' `` Yeah , yeah . Look , I know what I 'm doing , '' Gobbo said . `` But you do n't know what they might do to you . '' At first , he was willing to overlook her indiscretions . Then one day , he noticed Gobbo leave the office in the company of a man he recognized as a cop -- the species she had so vocally despised . Abramson was mystified . `` You do n't run with the hounds and play with the foxes , '' he told her . `` You just ca n't . '' They mutually agreed she would leave the firm after a year , when she would officially join the defense bar . But they remained close , and for nearly a decade , Abramson would continue to work alongside her on cases . Gobbo hung out her shingle as an independent barrister and built up her practice defending an oddball collection of minor criminals : a failed magazine publisher accused of harassing his secretaries , a prisoner who broke out to check on his girlfriend , a man who tried to smuggle rare parrot eggs in his underwear . `` When I started practicing , I had a lot of passion and a lot of drive , '' she later told an associate . `` There was a lot of variety . There was the excitement of , ` Where am I going today ? Who am I going to meet ? ' '' F Faruk Orman , the lifelong drift that led him to Gobbo seemed at times directed by fate . He 'd met Benji Veniamin at a kebab restaurant when they were kids in Sunshine , a working-class , immigrant-heavy suburb west of Melbourne . Orman was raised by his Turkish Cypriot mother ; his father had abandoned the family and returned to Turkey when he was 9 . Not long afterward , his older brother died of leukemia . As a teenager , the awkward and shy Orman gravitated toward Veniamin , a tattooed amateur boxer and the son of Greek Cypriot immigrants . A thriving marijuana distributor by his early 20s , Veniamin had already shown an aptitude for violence , raiding other dealers for their stashes . When he began associating with Mick Gatto , an illegal gambling kingpin and member of the so-called `` Carlton Crew , '' in the early 2000s , he brought Orman with him . The Carlton Crew was a loose mixture of Irish and Italian bookmakers , extortionists , and loan sharks . In addition to Gatto , it included a prominent drug dealer named Lewis Moran , whose sons , Jason and Mark , were active suppliers in the city 's party-drug scene . In 1999 , the Morans began a feud with a young drug cook and sometime ally named Carl Williams . Among other affronts , Williams had married a woman formerly attached to a friend of the Morans . More significantly , he 'd underpriced the market with his own drug supply . The brothers lured Williams to a city park , where Jason Moran shot him in the stomach but decided to let him live . Williams declined to press charges -- telling the incredulous police that he had n't seen who 'd shot him . Privately , he vowed to take revenge . Williams 's vendetta would launch years of violence that the Australian press dubbed `` the gangland killings , '' involving nearly 30 murders , beginning with Mark Moran in June 2000 . The mob bosses and hit men would become household names , as would many of the victims . Williams , meanwhile , had allied his growing drug-production business with another Carlton Crew rival : Antonios `` Tony '' Mokbel . Born to Lebanese immigrant parents , Mokbel was a former pizza shop owner who had been in and out of prison on drug charges . In the late 1990s , as the amphetamine business surged , he built an underground empire dubbed `` the Company , '' branching out into real estate , race horses , and a fashion line . Williams , a husky local boy with Lance Bass hair , and Mokbel , a suit-wearing Tony Soprano doppelg\u00e4nger , dominated the multibillion-dollar drug trade as it fractured into violence . `` We were all mates , '' Mokbel later told a reporter . `` It started over a silly thing and suddenly there were just bodies falling all around me . '' Williams , Mokbel , and the murders were daily fodder for the front pages of the Rupert Murdoch -- owned tabloid the Herald Sun . The press fueled mounting public pressure to stop the killings . The Victoria Police established a special task force in the spring of 2003 , code-named Purana . It would be a two-pronged effort to solve the murders and stem the drug trade , staffed with `` the best of the best '' officers from around the force . Still , the killings continued . Within weeks of Purana 's launch came the murder that would stun Australia . On the afternoon of June 21 , 2003 , the surviving Moran brother , Jason , and a bodyguard had just loaded Moran 's 6-year-old twins and their three friends into a van , following the kids ' Australian Rules football practice . A masked gunman ran up to the driver 's side window , blew it out with a shotgun , and then fired a revolver through it five times , killing the two men in full view of the children . Eight months and six murders later , in March 2004 , Benji Veniamin walked into an Italian restaurant for a meeting with Gatto . Veniamin had long since switched sides and allied himself with Williams , and Gatto believed that Veniamin had been involved in the murder of a close friend . They began arguing in a back hallway , five shots rang out , and Gatto emerged from the back covered in blood . Charged with murder , he argued that Veniamin had pulled the gun , Gatto had grabbed his hand , and then shot him through the neck and head in self-defense . Orman , who was at the restaurant when the shooting happened , testified on Gatto 's behalf , and a jury acquitted him of the charges . Two weeks after Veniamin 's murder , a pair of masked gunmen burst into the crowded Brunswick Club , where Lewis Moran was known to drink . One chased him through a bank of poker machines before shooting him in the back of the head . It was the murder everyone had seen coming but the police proved powerless to stop . `` Last night was the first time I have been shocked by what has occurred , '' Simon Overland , the deputy commissioner who had launched Purana , told reporters . `` What we 're dealing with here is a desperately serious situation . '' Operating amid that chaos , with her defense services increasingly in demand , was Nicola Gobbo . A A legal community featuring few prominent women attorneys , particularly defense barristers , Gobbo stood out by default . As her defense practice moved up the hierarchy of Melbourne 's underworld , she increasingly became a subject of the same press that greeted her clients outside the courtroom . By early 2002 , that included Mokbel , who hired her while in jail on cocaine and amphetamine charges to advocate for his bail . In a clever legal maneuver , Gobbo convinced the judge that an ongoing corruption scandal in the police drug squad meant that Mokbel 's prosecution should be shelved . With his release on an AUD $ 1 million bond -- complete with a provision allowing him to travel to Queensland for a lavish beach vacation -- Gobbo 's public profile began to explode . She appeared in the city 's gossip pages , spotted wearing a sling after a gym accident , or on vacation buying rounds at the Hard Rock Cafe in Bali . She was also earning a reputation among both clients and cops as a formidable advocate . `` She 's good at what she does , '' said Charlie Bezzina , a retired homicide detective who appeared in trials opposite Gobbo . `` You knew that you were in for a fight . She knew her stuff . She was destined to become a Supreme Court judge . '' `` She was a very , very good operator , '' said Ruth Parker , the defense attorney . `` And she came with the clout of the Gobbo name . '' But among her colleagues , Parker said , `` people often did n't like her , or trust her , because she was always seen socializing with her clients . '' So routinely was she spotted with Mokbel and other clients at Wheat , an outdoor caf\u00e9 downstairs from her office , that people joked police had bugged the salt shakers at her favorite table . A respected female barrister pulled Gobbo aside , as David Abramson had , and warned her that she was crossing ethical lines . But Gobbo seemed simultaneously enthralled with the world of her clients and unconcerned about appearances . So unconcerned , in fact , that she often represented a kind of neutral presence amid the shifting alliances of the gangland war . Back in the summer of 2003 , Gobbo obtained another $ 1 million drug bail , this time for Lewis Moran of the Carlton Crew -- arguing that his grandkids needed `` a father figure and a role model '' after the murder of his sons . Only weeks later , she appeared in court on behalf of a man police suspected had shot Jason Moran in front of those grandkids . Within months , she was also representing Carl Williams , the man who 'd signed their death warrants . Purana had arrested Williams in November 2003 , after listening devices installed in his house captured him threatening a detective named Stuart Bateson , who 'd been assigned to investigate him , and Bateson 's girlfriend . Gobbo appeared in court for Williams the following day , complaining that her client had been deprived of food , his antidepressants , and a change of clothing . His legal team then argued successfully for bail on the basis that the threats were a joke -- Williams knew his house was bugged , they pointed out . Five days after Williams walked free , Gobbo showed up as a guest of honor at a lavish $ 150,000 christening he threw for his daughter at Melbourne 's Crown Casino . She was photographed in a low-cut cocktail dress standing between Williams and Benji Veniamin , the three of them beaming like old friends . She then took the stage alongside Williams and delivered a speech . `` I 've been asked to make a special thank-you that Carl could be with us tonight , '' she said , and offered a mock toast to `` the boys at Purana and , especially , Stuart Bateson . '' By then , Gobbo 's gangland stature had earned her her own profile in the Herald Sun , headlined `` Million-dollar eagle flies high . '' `` A formidable presence in impossibly short skirts , the blonde , blue-eyed barrister is fast becoming a legal celebrity , '' the paper proclaimed . As often happened , even amid Gobbo 's colleagues , her legal prowess was downplayed in favor of stereotypes and snide asides . `` But the niece of former governor Sir James Gobbo is described by a sibling as a one-person Salvation Army , '' the paper added . `` She spends time at weekends visiting clients in prison or on remand . However , she has managed to rile some of those in the police force who pay professionally when she succeeds . '' `` I have friends who are police , '' she told the reporter . `` I have clients who are police , former police who are clients . Those that are professional in what they do ... it 's not an antagonistic relationship at all . '' Those same police were indirectly supplying her with more clients . In 2004 , after years of running up against a `` wall of silence , '' as the cops called it , Purana slowly began to get a grip on the gangland war . The first domino to fall was a client of Gobbo 's : the driver of the getaway vehicle in the children 's football-clinic murders . He rolled on both the shooter and Williams , telling police Williams had ordered the hit . The shooter then followed , and in June 2004 , Williams was arrested on multiple murder charges . He would never be released again , eventually pleading guilty to three murders and conspiracy to commit a fourth , earning him a minimum of 35 years in prison . Tony Mokbel would be the next to fall , when the government finally took him to trial in early 2006 on his long-delayed drug charges . Again , Gobbo would represent him . This time , on one of the final days of his trial , Mokbel failed to show up in court . Police soon discovered he 'd vanished from the country . He was convicted in absentia of cocaine trafficking and sentenced to 12 years in prison . Mokbel 's departure marked the beginning of the end for Purana 's biggest targets , even as many of the murders remained unsolved . With Mokbel on the run , Williams inside , and the Carlton Crew decimated , the killings dwindled . The drug trade simply adapted , as did Nicola Gobbo . In June 2007 , customs officers intercepted a massive shipment of ecstasy , worth some $ 400 million on the street , hidden inside 3,000 tomato cans in a container arriving from Naples , Italy . The alleged importers had ties to the Calabrian mafia . One of them was already a client of Gobbo 's . `` It never ends , '' Simon Overland lamented to a reporter , reflecting on Purana 's successes . `` As we take one individual or group out , others take their place . '' The same month , after more than a year on the run , Mokbel was finally captured at a caf\u00e9 in Athens , Greece , slimmed down and sporting a ludicrous brown wig . He promptly called Nicola Gobbo , who began helping him fight extradition , a battle that would take two years . `` I knew it would come to this at some stage , '' he told a reporter in a Greek courtroom . `` You ca n't stay on the run forever . You 've got to die with pride . That 's life . '' Two weeks later , Faruk Orman was arrested in the long-unsolved Victor Peirce murder . Orman 's first call , as well , was to Gobbo . As the gangland violence faded , there were stirrings that Gobbo had somehow run afoul of dangerous forces . From prison , Carl Williams lodged a formal complaint with the Legal Services Commission claiming Gobbo was working against him , visiting opposing witnesses in his case in prison . In a letter to a friend , Williams said he believed Gobbo was a `` dog , '' Australian slang for snitch . She began receiving anonymous threats by text message , calling her a `` slut fuck dog '' and telling her to `` keep your mouth shut or die . '' Then , on April 16 , 2008 , she was sitting in a restaurant when her BMW , parked outside , suddenly went up in flames . When firefighters arrived , they were unable to save the car and found two bags full of cash smoldering in the trunk . R Reporter Anthony Dowsley , Nicola Gobbo was for years a figure of only passing interest , one of any number of criminal lawyers who popped in and out of the spotlight . Dowsley arrived on the crime desk of the Herald Sun at the end of 2004 , after bouncing around in community newspapers . With a stocky build and a penchant for jeans and T-shirts , his own paper once described him in a story as `` marked by sartorial indifference . '' He felt at home in the daily news churn and viewed reporting as a vocation more than a job -- the hours and days spent chatting up sources on the chance that one of them , one day , could confirm a scoop . `` You build your networks out , and that 's how you corner stories , really , '' he said . When he landed at the Sun , the gangland murders featured heavily amid the tabloid 's daily diet of scandal , celebrity , and sports . His day-to-day beat crossed paths with the killings , he told me , but `` not at a high level . '' Five years and hundreds of stories later , the war had wound down , and the police from the Purana task force were lauded as heroes . On the back of its success , Simon Overland rose to the top job of chief commissioner of the Victoria Police . Detective Sergeant Stuart Bateson was enshrined into Australian pop culture , alongside the likes of Carl Williams and Tony Mokbel , with the release of Underbelly , a television series on the national Nine Network . The show dramatized the gangland killings with enough fidelity that the Supreme Court temporarily banned its airing in February 2008 , out of fear it would taint the jury pool in the still-ongoing trials . Because of his public pursuit of Williams and the threats against him , Bateson served as the model for the lead Purana cop in the series and had a cameo as an extra in one of the episodes . Gobbo was n't a character in Underbelly , but she continued to appear in the remaining fragments of the gangland story . In early 2009 , Dowsley reported on the arrest of a former police detective named Paul Dale , accused of the murders of an informer named Terence Hodson and his wife . Hodson had been arrested in a drug-house burglary in 2003 , along with Dale 's drug-squad colleague . He had subsequently told police that Dale had orchestrated the job -- part of an ongoing scheme in which cops were raiding drug houses and selling the merchandise themselves . Gobbo was set to represent Hodson in the case . But before it could get to court , Hodson and his wife were found dead in their home , shot in the back of their heads . The case was so tangled that Simon Overland had given it its own task force . For years , the police maintained a theory that Dale had arranged the killings , but there was scant evidence to corroborate it . Then in 2009 , they got a break : Carl Williams -- already serving 35 years -- decided to talk . He gave a statement claiming that years before , when Dale was on the force , he had paid Dale for information , meeting with him at least a dozen times . The two were so suspicious of each other , he noted , that they 'd once met in bathing suits at a public pool to make sure neither party was armed . -LRB- Dale denied ever entering the pool . -RRB- At one of their meetings in 2004 , Williams claimed , Dale had offered to pay him $ 150,000 to organize the hit against the Hodsons . Even more intriguing to Dowsley , the murder case against Dale came with a second witness . He 'd overheard a source saying that Nicola Gobbo had worn a wire to a meeting with Dale in a Melbourne park . On the recording , Dale described Carl Williams 's recollections as `` very accurate , to the point of every single time we met , he seems to have documented it . '' The tape was n't exactly a confession , but Gobbo 's and Williams 's testimonies would form the backbone of the state 's case against Dale . Dowsley was unsure what to make of it . `` I did think it was very odd that someone in her position would wear a wire , '' he said . `` I did n't do anything about it because I did n't have any detail around it . '' Soon the information would be moot . On April 9 , 2010 , Carl Williams was bludgeoned to death with the seatpost of an exercise bike by a fellow prisoner . The case against Dale collapsed . Weeks afterward , Gobbo did something Dowsley found even more odd : She went on national television and outed herself as the witness . Sitting at an outdoor table at night , with a walking cane propped beside her , she calmly read a short , prepared statement to a reporter from the Australian network ABC . `` Having had the courage and strength to agree to become a witness , '' she said , `` I was required to give up my home , my security , my sense of life as I knew it . '' She offered no explanation for why she 'd done it but claimed that now the police had abandoned her without pay . `` I was assured by Mr. Overland that I would be compensated and that I would be left no worse off , '' she said . `` My health has deteriorated as a result of constant stress and uncertainty . I remain in fear for my life since agreeing to give evidence for Victoria Police . '' She then filed a lawsuit against the force for $ 20 million . The Melbourne legal community was baffled . Gobbo had always been out on the edge , but a barrister secretly recording an ex-cop seemed beyond the pale , even for her . Some colleagues speculated that the police had something on her -- perhaps she 'd gotten criminally entangled with her clients after all -- and pressured her into wearing a wire . The Victoria Police quickly settled Gobbo 's lawsuit for a reported $ 2.9 million . When Dale was charged with perjury , based on the tape Gobbo had made , she failed to show up as a witness in his trial . -LRB- Dale was acquitted and has never been convicted of the accusations Victoria Police leveled against him . -RRB- Gobbo left the Victoria Bar , had her first child , and retreated from public view . It would be another three years before Dowsley picked up the story again . One afternoon , he was at a South Melbourne pub frequented by cops and lawyers , discussing a rumor that Gobbo 's child -- the object of some speculation in the legal community -- had been fathered by a senior police figure . Someone jokingly suggested to Dowsley that he could track down the child 's birth certificate . `` It was n't really that interesting to me , '' he said of the paternity speculation , for which there was no evidence . `` The interesting bit was how she seemed to be in close proximity to police , senior police '' -- enough , at least , for the rumor to gain traction . `` It sparked something in my mind : Why does she know so many people ? What has been her role with police ? '' Those were the questions Dowsley began putting to police and legal sources over the next year . The answers came at first in snippets of fact and speculation . She had been listed as a potential witness in other cases beyond the Hodson murders , he learned , but never appeared in court . She sometimes seemed to be quietly pitting one of her clients against another . She used burner phones , someone told him . Even more intriguing , he heard that the Victoria Police were in the midst of closing down a secret division , and somehow Gobbo was the reason . To Dowsley , it all seemed to add up to one outlandish possibility . Sitting with a law-enforcement source one day , he expressed it aloud : Had Nicola Gobbo been a police informer all along ? The source looked at him , said nothing , and gave him a thumbs-up . T There , the story `` just started spiraling out , '' Dowsley said , one that seemed at first too extraordinary to believe . Nicola Gobbo , among the most fierce and famous defense attorneys in Melbourne , counsel to mob bosses and drug kingpins , had been a registered informer for the Victoria Police , code-named 3838 . She 'd been supplying cops with information since before she ever became a lawyer , but her most significant help had come at the height of the gangland war . In Gobbo , Dowsley had found the missing link in how Purana had cracked it . Her information had led to hundreds of arrests , overseen by the highest levels of the Victoria Police , including Simon Overland . But the existence of her double life had never been disclosed at any trial . `` All of that becomes a mess of conspiracy to defraud the justice system , '' he realized . `` I pretty much worked that out in six to eight weeks . '' Dowsley reported out the story on his own , telling no one , before finally revealing it to his editors in March 2014 . He 'd hoped for more time to tie up the loose ends , but as soon as the paper 's brass heard what he had , they wanted the story in print . For the first time , he called Gobbo , who batted away the accusations . `` I would call them weak denials , '' Dowsley recalled . `` But there was also tacit agreement that I was n't on the wrong track . There was this ` I do n't know what you are talking about ' kind of stuff , a bit of silence . There was no ` do n't write this ' or ` you are wrong . ' I knew it was right by then , and I let her know that . '' He spent hours on the phone with representatives from the Victoria Police , who had also dispatched lawyers to take the paper to court in the hope of stopping the story 's publication . Gobbo , now a mother of two , faced a high risk of being killed , as did her children , they claimed . Outside the courtroom , the paper 's and the police 's lawyers came to an agreement : The story would go forward with certain details removed . Published on March 31 , 2014 , under the headline `` Lawyer a secret police informer , '' the piece replaced her name with a pseudonym concocted by Dowsley 's editor : `` Lawyer X. '' The article , just a few hundred words , captured only the general contours of the story -- enough to be shocking but without the mountain of specific evidence Dowsley had gathered . The paper published a second story the next day before the police again returned to court . When Dowsley called Gobbo again , she intimated that she was unhappy with the police and might join the newspaper 's fight to tell all about her past . He quickly realized it was another spy game . `` She was basically trying to glean information out of me , which is quite a pattern of behavior , where she plays both sides , '' he said . `` She was just playing with us . '' On April 2 , a state court issued an injunction banning publication of any further mention of Lawyer X . The Herald Sun was forced to stop the presses to remove a follow-up article from the next day 's paper . For five years , Dowsley 's reporting was largely put on ice . Other media outlets openly questioned whether he 'd overreached with his original story . But Dowsley 's articles had set another chain of events in motion . The anti-corruption wing of the Victoria Police launched its own internal investigation of `` Human Source number 3838 , '' as did the state 's director of Public Prosecutions . When the latter concluded that it had an obligation to alert some of Gobbo 's former clients to potential conflicts in their representation , the police and Gobbo both sued to stop them . Since every entity in the suit was meant to remain secret , it traveled through the courts under the farcical designation AB & EF v. CD . Finally , in November 2018 , the High Court of Australia ruled against Gobbo and the police , although it kept her name secret pending a final appeal . In the verdict , the justices expressed shock at law enforcement 's `` reprehensible conduct '' and Gobbo 's `` fundamental and appalling breaches '' of basic legal principle , calling it `` corrupted in a manner which debased fundamental principles of the criminal justice system . '' The following month , the premier of Victoria announced a Royal Commission -- a special independent investigative body convened for matters of public importance -- to examine the use of Lawyer X. Then , on March 1 , 2019 , the Supreme Court lifted the suppression order on Nicola Gobbo 's identity . Months before , Dowsley and a reporting partner named Patrick Carlyon had put together an eight-part series detailing the astonishing revelations they 'd uncovered about Gobbo 's informer career . Then they 'd shelved it , waiting for this day to arrive . By 5:22 p.m. on March 1 , the articles were live , and Dowsley had upended the previous legends of the gangland war . `` This is affecting almost every big case of organized crime that hit Melbourne , '' he told me . `` It 's revisiting everything that happened before . '' H He was piecing together Gobbo 's secret life , Anthony Dowsley had paid a visit to David Abramson . He was known to have given Gobbo her start in criminal law and to still be close with her . He 'd even once represented her in an unsuccessful lawsuit against the Herald Sun . So Dowsley remained cagey about the nature of his investigation until the pair sat down across a coffee-shop table . `` David , she 's an informer , '' Dowsley said . `` Bullshit , '' Abramson responded . He 'd heard the rumors years before from criminals whose cases had gone sideways . Gobbo must be working with the police , they 'd told him . He had always dismissed them as disgruntled criminals looking for someone to blame . This time , however , Dowsley started laying out the details of what he 'd learned , and Abramson saw his own past reconfiguring before his eyes . `` Suddenly , three and three became six , '' he said , `` and I realized I 've been very na\u00efve . '' Gobbo had n't lied to Abramson about her 1993 arrest , not exactly . That August , after an anonymous tip , the police had begun weeks of surveillance on a house belonging to Gobbo -- `` said to be the niece of Justice Gobbo of the Supreme Court '' -- a report noted . The focus of the investigation was a suspected drug dealer named Brian Wilson , with whom Gobbo was `` living in a de facto relationship . '' A raid turned up 3 pounds of amphetamines , nearly a pound of marijuana , and a cache of weapons . Wilson and another man were arrested at the house ; the police picked up Gobbo at the university . All three were charged with drug possession and pleaded guilty . Gobbo received probation and a `` good-behavior bond , '' expunging her record after a year . Left out of Gobbo 's account was the fact that two years later , the police had raided the house again , finding another stash of speed . This time , Gobbo was frantic , telling an officer that another drug charge could keep her from being admitted to the bar . The officers on the scene that day have since claimed not to recall the precise moment when Gobbo became a source . But no charges were filed against her , and shortly afterward , she was officially registered as police informer G395 . Her initial information concerned the continued dealings of her semi-estranged boyfriend , Wilson . Gobbo was `` eager to participate , '' a detective named Tim Argall recalled at the Royal Commission hearings , and offered to introduce an undercover police officer to Wilson . But from the beginning , Gobbo could be a difficult source , Argall said . She invented her own pseudonym for the undercover agent without consulting her handlers and then mentioned the name to Wilson . `` Plucked a name , and we had to run with it , '' as Argall put it . She asked for favors , calling Argall for help in avoiding what she said were a pack of reporters hounding her over a Victoria election controversy to which she had a minor connection . The police agreed to meet her at a mall , only to discover that no one seemed to be following her . Shortly after Gobbo introduced the undercover cop to Wilson , the operation fizzled out . A police report in 1996 noted that Gobbo was `` a loose cannon '' who was `` making arrangements and not liaising -LSB- with investigators -RSB- . '' Curiously , by 1998 , the police were again turning to Gobbo , now a practicing lawyer . This time the target was David Abramson , her mentor . Her datebook recounts a meeting with a pair of police sergeants in which one told her that Abramson `` is a crook , should be in jail , '' and that she could be implicated in possible illegality herself . `` Mud sticks , get a raincoat soon , '' the officer advised , she wrote , indicating that `` he was aware of my priors . '' Gobbo told her new handlers that she could supply evidence that Abramson was involved in money laundering . She accessed his digital files and handed copies to the police . Once again , the operation went nowhere . Looking back , Abramson believes that Gobbo had seen an email in which he 'd suggested to a drug-dealing client that he put his money into flipping houses . Even now , he seems astounded that for years afterward , Gobbo had remained a close friend . He and his wife , he said , had looked after her following the death of her mother . They 'd bought her children Christmas presents , even though the Abramsons were Jewish . `` My colleagues laugh at me , a bloke who is suspicious in cases with witnesses , '' he told me . `` And in fact , I had one in my office , and I did n't pick it up . '' Gobbo 's new handlers , like the previous ones , found her demeanor confounding at times . She requested favors , like asking an officer to look into a restraining order connected to another client . `` I think she was testing the relationship , '' a former police officer named Jeffrey Pope told the Royal Commission . -LRB- Gobbo would later claim that she and Pope engaged in a sexual relationship , an accusation Pope denies . -RRB- `` She was also someone difficult to keep focused , '' he added . `` She would talk an awful lot about a whole range of things , lots of discussion about criminals ... high-profile crimes , police , policing , football , politics . '' After her information against Abramson came to nothing , in 1999 her informer status was changed to `` inactive . '' But rather than cut off contact with police , they slipped into a kind of friendly background rapport . She `` was very social with police members and in the legal fraternity , '' one officer later testified . With the Melbourne gangland war heating up and her client list expanding to include the likes of Mokbel and Williams , Gobbo could be found drinking with Paul Dale and other members of the drug squad . Officers wrapped up in police-corruption scandals came to her for legal advice . By mid-2003 , Gobbo was back to providing covert assistance -- `` informally , '' as she would describe it -- this time to Purana Detective Sergeant Stuart Bateson , the subject of her own mocking toast at Williams 's daughter 's christening . She told Bateson she was frustrated with Williams 's attempts to manipulate witnesses and began updating the Purana detective on both Williams 's and Mokbel 's efforts to intimidate anyone who could testify against them . Among those potential witnesses was another client of hers , the alleged driver in the football clinic murders . She would later claim that it was she who helped the police convince him to roll on Williams , the first crack in `` the wall of silence . '' As Gobbo knew , there are generally two types of confidential informers who find themselves working for law enforcement . The first are those who are in some kind of legal jeopardy , whether convicted , under arrest , or living in fear of it . These assist police in the hopes of favorable treatment : a lighter sentence , say , or a lesser charge . The second are those who do it for money , whether regular payments or rewards at the end of a case . Nicola Gobbo , as a law student facing drug charges , began her informer career as the first specimen . But now she seemed to have evolved into a third , nearly singular species : a practicing lawyer eager to undermine her clients . Her motivations often seemed as pliable as they were baffling . In retrospect , her habit of popping up amid important cases seemed less random than by design . The drug house that was robbed by Terence Hodson and a police officer ? She 'd represented the owner . When Hodson offered to inform on Dale about the drug-house robbery , she 'd served as the conduit to police . And yet one night in 2004 , out at a pub with Dale , she 'd made a call to Carl Williams and handed him the phone . There was no part of the web that she did n't seem to have touched . She soon discovered that her double life came with a toll . One morning in July 2004 , in the midst of one of the gangland trials , she woke up unable to speak , and a friend rushed her to the hospital where doctors diagnosed a stroke . It took her a week to recover her speech , and part of her face remained paralyzed . She slowly returned to work , but the stroke , which her doctor attributed to stress , fed into a growing disillusionment with her work . She was 32 years old , unhealthy , and overworked , she later said , wondering what she 'd done with her life . Then in August , after a bail hearing for a client , two detectives from the Victoria Police Source Development Unit -LRB- SDU -RRB- approached her at the courthouse . They quietly asked whether , given what she 'd already been providing to Bateson , she might be willing to help the police out more formally . `` If anyone finds out about this , I will be murdered , '' she told them . `` Yes , this would have to be managed carefully , '' one replied . Gobbo agreed to come in , and on a second meeting , seemed decidedly less concerned . She was eager to `` be rid of '' certain clients `` who tend to consume a large portion of the Source 's time and resources , '' she told them , according to a risk assessment compiled by the SDU . Chief among them was Tony Mokbel , who she said was pressuring her to make sure other members of his organization , arrested on drug charges , kept their mouths shut . `` Look , ideally what would be fantastic would be you arrest him , '' she said . `` I know that 's a terrible , terrible thing to say to anyone . '' The SDU assessment considered whether Gobbo might `` enjoy acting as a police agent '' -- she suggested , unprompted , that the police bug her office and she carry a recorder at all times . They noted that she 'd `` had intimate relationships with some Police members , and it is not known if these are ongoing . '' A `` lack of control '' over Gobbo , they noted , could `` jeopardize investigations '' and lead to her exposure , causing `` embarrassment and criticism of the Force . '' She was , after all , a defense attorney and practically a celebrity , as one officer told her . But ultimately , the police concluded that Gobbo , with her access to high-level criminals and history of providing useful intel , was worth the risk . She represented , as an internal police report later put it , `` an opportunity for Victoria Police that had never before been encountered and in all probability will never be encountered again . '' On September 16 , 2005 , the SDU officially registered Gobbo as an informer for a second time -- Human Source 3838 -- providing a phone number for her to use exclusively for all her future contacts . The same day , Gobbo sat down for her preliminary interview with her new handlers . The police assured her that she was not being recorded , but the tape was already running . `` So where do we start ? '' one of them asked . `` Well , you -- I guess you can start , '' Gobbo said . `` I 'd like to say , tell me everything you know about Tony Mokbel , '' the officer replied . `` How many weeks have you booked the room for ? '' she said . `` Well , to be quite honest , if you want to go down that track , we will . It will take as long as it takes . '' A Australia , as in the U.S. , the legal system includes protections for what 's popularly known as `` attorney-client privilege . '' Grounded in English common law and dating to the 16th century , legal professional privilege holds that communications between attorneys and people seeking legal advice ca n't be discovered by police or courts and used against them . In its modern incarnation , the privilege belongs to the client , not the attorney . With the exception of certain rare circumstances -- such as if the information was part of a fraud or threatens the safety of another person -- only the client is permitted to waive the right and reveal what they 've told a lawyer . Attorneys under common law -- derived systems also owe a `` duty of loyalty '' to their clients : an obligation to act in their interests and provide them with the most vigorous possible defense . Those duties and privileges are more professional obligations -- protected by the court -- than they are statutory ones . Nicola Gobbo was about to dismantle them in ways the legal system had never experienced . Less than two weeks after sitting down to inform on Tony Mokbel in 2005 , Gobbo represented Mokbel in court . In the hearing , she sought a subpoena for information from police about informers they 'd used in the case against him . As she ramped up her work for the SDU , her police handlers -- later identified at the Royal Commission with pseudonyms as officers `` White , '' `` Black , '' `` Green , '' `` Fox , '' and `` Smith '' -- seemed at least cognizant of the professional jeopardy Gobbo faced if her new role was to be uncovered . From the beginning , they assured her that -- for both her sake and theirs -- she would never have to appear as a witness . Her information would be used to help them investigate , not prosecute . `` The information that I gave to police , more often than not I came across because they would encourage me to go and have dinner with 15 criminals ... the Mokbel group and associates , because they would have all of their runners there , '' she later told one of the internal police investigations . `` Quite often their mistresses would be invited as well , and they would talk very openly ... . I would carry on a conversation with one person but would be listening to two or three other conversations and it was in that context that I then provided information to the police , not knowing specifically the value of it or how it would be used . And as it turns out , sometimes it was of immense assistance to them . '' Her instructions , she said , amounted to : `` You tell us what you hear and let us work out what we do with it . '' The Source Development Unit had been created precisely to protect the Victoria Police 's informers from exposure to either the court system or to criminals . Sources would pass their intel to special SDU handlers , who would then strip it of identifying information and move it on to investigators , providing a `` sterile corridor '' to help protect sources ' identities . Gobbo , however , seemed unconfined by the corridor . She cycled through handlers and worked directly with investigators , providing random bits of information across a seemingly endless assortment of cases . Her information in turn was so valuable to Purana that investigators began tasking her with specific missions , requests that Gobbo seemed to enthusiastically carry out . She wanted , she told them at one point , to be the best human source in the history of Victoria Police . `` Source wants to know if any other person has helped as much as she has and if anyone comes close she needs to be told so that she can try harder , '' one source contact report noted . `` Source advised that she has a comfortable lead !! '' Gobbo was so prolific that , at times , she had trouble keeping track of it all . `` You see I ca n't in my own mind work out sometimes what I know from reading a brief or what I know from a court case , what I know from conversations with people , what I know secondhand from police officers or whatever , '' she told officers Smith and White . She began talking to her handlers multiple times a day , seven days a week . She probed them for information even as she was providing it , making suggestions about the timing of arrests and strategizing about what would follow when one of her clients was detained . In transcripts , her handlers often gestured meekly at the idea that Gobbo was n't doing anything wrong . `` What happens at the end ? '' she asked about the arrest of one client in a meeting with White and Smith . `` The first thing he 's gon na do , we would assume , is ... ring you , '' White would tell her . `` He 'll ring no one else but me , '' Gobbo replied . `` And what would be your response ? '' asked White . She 'd advise the client to `` not say a word , '' she said . `` How does that work , if you represent him whilst at the same time you 've been instrumental in his apprehension ? '' White said . `` That 's one of the things that keeps me up at night , '' Gobbo replied . `` Have you got a plan for how you are gon na manage that ? '' `` What 's the big deal ? You 're not gon na tell him , '' she said . `` No , we 're not , but -- '' `` Nor am I. I do n't really feel like being dead this month . '' Other times , Gobbo seemed overwhelmed by the scope of her ethical transgressions , warning her handlers of the potential consequences of the sterile corridor breaking down . `` Repeatedly , I 've chucked ethics out the window , I 've chucked legal professional privilege out the window , I 've chucked my career out the window , '' she told White . `` If this gets out , '' she said at another point , `` say nice things at my eulogy , because I will be gone -- and enjoy the Royal Commission . '' Gobbo was doing more than simply providing information , however . She was strategically representing lower-level members of organizations like Williams 's and Mokbel 's , pressuring them to roll on their bosses . She was given free rein of Victoria 's jails and prisons , coming and going to meet old clients and solicit new ones -- some of whom were informing on one another . She coaxed statements from them at the behest of police and later claimed that for at least one , she 'd shaped it without the witness even knowing . `` I went to Purana secretly one night and edited all his statements , '' she told officer Green in one transcript . `` I corrected them . But no one ever knows about that . That would never come out . '' When it did come out , Gobbo 's role as 3838 turned the understanding of case after case inside out . The moment that unlocked the `` tomato tin '' ecstasy bust , for example , arrived in June 2007 , when a Gobbo client named Rob Karam was due in court on drug charges . For months , Gobbo had been providing information on Karam , who 'd had connections to both Mokbel and the Calabrian mafia in Italy . Now , before heading into court , Karam asked Gobbo to hold onto a pile of documents , worried that he could be searched . Among them , Gobbo discovered the bill of lading for a shipping container arriving in three weeks from Italy . She photocopied the documents and handed them over that evening to officer Fox . When Customs intercepted the container , they discovered the tomato cans full of 4.4 tons of pills . The authorities quietly held the container on the dock and then monitored the panic among the criminals awaiting it , eventually gathering enough evidence for more than 30 blockbuster convictions , including Karam 's . Just weeks later , Gobbo landed one of Purana 's most coveted targets , Faruk Orman -- the man who had her cellphone number at the ready when he was arrested in the murder of Victor Peirce . Little did Orman know that his own phone was being monitored by the police . The person who had given them his number to target was the same one he was now calling for legal help : Nicola Gobbo . Orman , she promptly told police , might roll on Mick Gatto , the one Carlton Crew member who had long eluded them . `` What an amazing golden opportunity for us , '' she said : more business for her and more information for them . -LRB- Gatto , who has long maintained he was never involved in illegal activity beyond gambling , declined to be interviewed for this story . -RRB- Orman , she told them , was obsessive-compulsive and afraid of being alone . He would be `` unable to cope '' if they placed him in harsh and isolated conditions . When Orman refused to roll , however , Gobbo had another move . She was representing not just Orman , it turned out , but the witness against him : the triple murderer who claimed that Orman and Veniamin had confessed . Now part of the team shaping Orman 's defense strategy , she was simultaneously helping the witness craft his evolving statements implicating Orman in the murders . When the witness wavered , she warned police to `` put him straight , '' according to court documents . She urged them to fight vigorously against Orman 's requests -- her own requests , in court -- for information about the witness , knowing that he 'd contradicted himself and lied to authorities multiple times . Years later , in 2015 , in a letter responding to an internal police inquiry , she would cite Orman 's conviction as one of her ten `` most significant '' contributions as an informer . The motivations behind Gobbo 's double life had always been a tangled mass , nearly impossible to pick apart . By the end , she was both an eager double agent and a reluctant pawn of the police . As the years stretched on , Gobbo seemed to her handlers increasingly manic . She 'd long been paranoid , living in fear of her clients , driving around the block twice when she came home and scanning for suspicious cars . By the time she agreed to wear a wire against Paul Dale , the former cop accused of murder , she had already been receiving anonymous texts threatening her with death and rape . Then her car was firebombed in April 2008 . By now her handler 's daily contact reports were filled with notes on her mental and physical health . `` 3838 is having trouble sleeping and dealing with her status as a human source . '' `` Discussed nerves etc and wanting to escape . '' `` 3838 is again in tears -- emotional . 3838 is frustrated with the current direction and status of the SDU relationship . '' `` Mentioned thoughts of ` suicide , ' clarified -- has no enthusiasm for life ... is not going to go and do anything dramatic . '' `` Extremely emotional and depressed . '' On January 12 , 2009 , with her potential testimony against Dale looming , the SDU formally deregistered her , realizing that public testimony would render her useless as an informer . For the first time , they began paying for her protection , along with perks like concert tickets , a horse-track membership , and spa treatments . By now they had documented more than 5,000 contacts with her since 2005 . More than 100 officers were connected at some level to Gobbo 's informing . By her own count , the police seized more than $ 60 million in criminal proceeds and charged 386 people based on information she 'd provided . `` To try to encompass my actual value , reliability and work for Victoria Police in any summary is immensely difficult , '' she later wrote in her letter to police . `` But there are probably more ... '' W Wood-paneled hearing room that hosts the Royal Commission into the Management of Police Informants sits on the sixth floor of a government building in downtown Melbourne . A metal detector just off the elevator is manned by a daily trio of security agents , but the mood among the guards is more sporting-event relaxed than it is airport-security paranoid . Despite the massive publicity around the Gobbo scandal -- at least two national reporters were covering it every day during the week I turned up in late October -- public attendance is generally light . The hearings , which have taken place in multiweek stretches since February 2019 , are livestreamed on the internet and have disgorged more than 10,000 pages of transcripts and evidence . One afternoon , I sat in the gallery behind a long table of lawyers , as many as 15 representing the constellation of interests in the Gobbo affair : the criminals , the handlers , the investigators , the Commission , and Gobbo herself . The former Purana detective Boris Buick was on the stand . Perched at a podium in front of him , one of the Commission 's lawyers was for the third day politely but relentlessly walking him through his thought process in the case of Faruk Orman . She returned to what had always been a troubling issue in the case : the fact that Gobbo , representing a witness against Orman , had appeared in court to supposedly advocate for Orman to receive more information about the witnesses against him . `` Ms. Gobbo was representing Mr. Orman in the early stages , seeking the disclosure upon which that defense relied ? '' the lawyer asked Buick . `` That 's right , '' Buick said . Despite years of testimony in criminal trials , the grandfatherly Buick appeared distinctly uncomfortable . He often paused before responding , licking his lips or clasping his hands and staring down into them as if seeking a better explanation than the ones he had . `` And no steps were taken to indicate to Mr. Orman that he was n't receiving impartial , independent representation during that period ? '' `` I answered those questions two days ago , '' Buick said . `` I do n't have a different answer for you , sorry . '' `` And the answer to that is no steps were taken ? '' the lawyer said , evenly . `` That 's right . '' The justice system had already passed its judgment on the decisions surrounding Gobbo and Orman . In June 2019 , the attorney general of Victoria had issued a special referral of Orman 's case back to the Court of Appeal for what 's called a `` petition for mercy . '' When his longtime attorney Ruth Parker pulled his files out of her office safe to write it , she suggested to the court that `` what might sound at first blush to be so outrageous as to be fiction or exaggeration was , in fact , the reality of what occurred . '' To me , later , she would call it `` the biggest criminal police-corruption conspiracy in the history of the Western world . '' The Victoria Office of Public Prosecutions largely declined to defend the conviction , conceding most of the facts and arguing around the edges . On July 25 , a judge declared Orman the victim of a `` substantial miscarriage of justice '' and immediately acquitted him . Orman walked out of the court arm in arm with Parker , flashing a smile for the photographers . The case provided a preview of the next phase of the Gobbo affair , when the courts will have to grapple with as many as 600 cases impacted by Gobbo 's involvement . Several of Gobbo 's other former clients , including Rob Karam of the tomato-tins bust , have already filed appeals of their sentences . Tony Mokbel has indicated that he will do the same . -LRB- So confident is Mokbel of his pending release that he reportedly bragged about it to other prisoners . In February , he was found stabbed with a shank . He survived . -RRB- Others who are out of prison may appeal to have their records expunged . `` They knew they were violating people 's rights , '' Anthony Dowsley told me . `` Whether those people were guilty or not . This is n't necessarily an innocence project . This is about the pillars of law and order , and how the justice system should work . '' Dowsley , for his part , has picked up every major journalism award in Australia and is working on a book on the scandal , titled Lawyer X , due out this spring . His stories are set to be adapted into an Australian TV series for Rupert Murdoch 's Foxtel network . The producers of Underbelly are also working on a new miniseries that revisits the story , this time with Gobbo as the focus . `` It 'll make the greatest story one day , '' Gobbo had mused to one of her handlers back in 2005 . `` That 's , well , that 's the book we 're never gon na write , '' he responded . What consequences Gobbo herself , or the police who enabled her , could face remain an open question . She will never practice law again , no doubt , but given that she ceased practicing as a barrister in 2009 , there 's no professional censure available to the Victoria Bar . Some legal observers believe that Gobbo and the police may be vulnerable to charges of `` perverting the course of justice '' or witness tampering . One officer after another has appeared before the Royal Commission to claim that they either never considered Gobbo 's informing to violate legal principles , or assumed that it must be legal or their command would have objected . Their job was to investigate and stop the murderous drug gangs , they 've said , and any information would do . But the police have been repeatedly caught failing to hand over swaths of documents to the Royal Commission -- once claiming that no one had ever asked for the password to a computer that housed hundreds of recordings of the handlers and Gobbo . The questions go to the top of the chain of command , including Simon Overland , who left the force in 2011 , and the current chief commissioner , Graham Ashton -- both of whom were personally involved in overseeing Gobbo 's use as a human source . In an internal investigation , Ashton had once called Gobbo a `` glittering prize '' who police believed `` could potentially solve a bunch of murders or prevent others . '' In mid-December , Overland appeared before the Royal Commission and at first denied knowing that Gobbo had ever breached legal privilege by informing on her own clients . The next day , however , he admitted under questioning that `` ethics were fucked '' and that the police had potentially committed illegal acts in signing up Gobbo to take down Mokbel while she simultaneously represented him . He revealed it had been Gobbo 's information that helped them catch her client on the run in Greece . `` They thought they 'd get away with it , '' Geoffrey Stewart , a defense barrister who has represented Paul Dale , told me . `` And they would do anything to secure convictions . Probably thinking that this gangland war has got to stop and whatever is going to assist us in that regard , let 's avail ourselves of it , no matter how wrong . But how can you not know that an informer who is representing people is informing on them ? I mean , it beggars belief . '' Gobbo herself is currently in hiding , somewhere outside Australia . -LRB- Her attorneys did n't respond to my requests for an interview with her or them . When I stopped one of them outside the Royal Commission hearings one afternoon , he said , `` You 're the one that 's been sending me emails . '' I suggested we could talk off the record . He cheerfully responded , `` That 's not going to happen . '' -RRB- In October , her attorneys presented psychological reports to the Royal Commission stating that she was unable to testify -- even by telephone -- because she was suffering from severe depression and `` deteriorating progressively in her intellectual and psychological functioning . '' The Royal Commission disagreed , ordering her to testify by telephone at the end of January . In another twist , Gobbo sat down for a television interview with a correspondent from ABC , who flew to meet her in an unnamed location outside Australia . The program aired on December 9 , just weeks after her lawyers had claimed she was unfit to testify . In the interview , shot against an anonymous black backdrop , Gobbo appeared lucid and composed , her voice catching with emotion only when she discussed what the ordeal had put her children through . She avoided specific details about her informing , citing the Royal Commission 's ongoing investigation . For the first time , she spoke publicly about the scandal , placing nearly all of the blame on the police , who she said had manipulated her good intentions . `` It began as an ethical and moral dilemma for me , knowing that people were gon na be murdered , '' she said . `` That morphed into a dependence on Victoria Police , or a small number of Victorian police officers . They made it clear to me that if I did n't continue to assist them and to do what they asked , then they would release my name and effectively feed me to the wolves . '' When the reporter asked whether she 'd breached legal professional privilege , Gobbo deflected . `` I suppose if I had my time over , I would do things very differently , '' she said . `` But then , on the other hand , I think , what choice did I have ... ? '' As to whether she could face criminal charges , she said , `` Anything I did or did n't do was at the behest and control and with the full knowledge and imprimatur of the Victoria Police . So if I 'm to be charged , then I suppose we 'll be in the dock together . '' When she first began formally supplying information to Purana back in 2005 , Gobbo expressed hope to her handlers that on the other side of it , she 'd be able to `` go back to the way it was before , which was no pressure , no paranoia . '' She dreamed of becoming a magistrate , or scaling back her legal practice to something small and sane . Now , she said , she suffered from suicidal thoughts and severe depression , as well as neuralgia , a consequence of her stroke that caused her `` constant , acute pain . '' She said police had told her that if she returned to Australia , her children would be removed from her for their own safety . `` I find myself thinking some days that this is an unbelievable nightmare that there is no end to , '' she said . Her greatest fear was no longer the criminals , she claimed , but the police . A Afternoon at the hearings , the commissioner order a closed session , excluding the public , so that Buick could discuss portions of the scandal still deemed too secret to reveal . -LRB- Australian reporters are allowed to attend closed sessions , but only report on portions of them . -RRB- Sitting alone in the adjacent media room , I looked up from my laptop to find Faruk Orman standing in front of me , seeming confused . I recognized him from news photos I 'd seen , but attired in a polo shirt and sock-less loafers with his sunglasses hanging from his shorts pocket , he looked like he 'd stepped off a cruise ship . Parker later told me that Orman had come to watch Boris Buick , the man who 'd helped put him away for 12 years , answer for it . I introduced myself and explained that the hearings had been closed for the remainder of the afternoon . He offered me a piece of gum and then asked whether it was like this in the U.S. I told him it struck me as an unusual circumstance . `` You ca n't even find out about your own bloody case here , '' he said . I asked whether he 'd be open to telling me his version of the story . Since a brief interview the day of his release , Orman had declined to speak to reporters , citing a planned lawsuit against the State of Victoria for malicious prosecution . `` Ah no , I do n't think so , mate , '' he said with a smile and wandered out . The Melbourne legal community remains staggered by the Gobbo revelations . `` It 's not just shocking , it 's unthinkable , '' one prominent Melbourne defense attorney told me . `` It trashes the whole criminal-justice system , '' the former chief crown prosecutor of the state of Victoria , Gavin Silbert , said . `` I mean , we are headed for anarchy , effectively , as a result of this . Already it 's done a huge amount of damage . If people ca n't seek legal advice without being turned over , being betrayed by a legal practitioner , it 's the fundamental root of the whole system we operate on . '' David Abramson told me he 'd experienced that anarchy . `` I 've had clients that come in -- they 've said to me , ` Look , how can I be confident that you will look out for my interests and not be blackmailed by the police , help yourself and your other clients , and bury me ? ' '' he said . `` And my answer is , ` I ca n't tell you that . If you 've got any doubts , go somewhere else . ' Because how can I tell them , ` Trust me , I 'm a lawyer ' ? '' When Ruth Parker and I walked away from the caf\u00e9 where we 'd been talking , she wondered aloud whether we 'd been watched by a cop a few tables away . `` All the lawyers are under surveillance . It 's crazy , '' she said . As for Orman , to the wider public , he will likely always be known as the getaway driver for a murder . But by the measures of the criminal-justice system , he is an innocent man who spent 12 years of his life in prison . There is no venue to further evaluate his ultimate guilt , because his right to a fair trial had been over the moment he 'd dialed Nicola Gobbo 's number . Upon his release , Orman set about returning to normal life . He planned to marry the woman he 'd been engaged to since before he went to prison and relished the workaday boredom of tasks like obtaining a new driver 's license . He 'd been in prison so long , Parker told me , the state required him to take a driving test . `` Do n't you think that 's sort of ironic ? '' she 'd asked him . `` Faruk was like , ` Mate , you 've no idea .

The WWE star , real name Rob Szatkowski , claims to be in a three-way relationship with his wife AND girlfriend . Van Dam decided to celebrate his win over Brian Cage while laying on a bed of rose petals with the two women . The American , who was married to Sonia Delbeck for 17 years , was first joined by his wife Katie Forbes in the bedroom . She rocked up in some skimpy sequin underwear before the pair cracked open a bottle of bubbly . They were then joined by blonde bombshell Jennifer Barlow for the first time . The `` throuple '' enjoyed a three-way kiss before Katie whipped off her bra as she felt `` a little overdressed '' . Both of the women disappeared out of shot before the topless pair returned armed with whipped cream . After the cream was smothered on Van Dam 's face and he was plastered in lipstick , the camera cut to a screen which read : `` Technical difficulties . '' LES MISERABLES Liv Morgan makes WWE return in bizarre lesbian storyline with Lana on RAW PAIGE TURNER WWE boss Triple H apologises to Paige for making crude sex joke about her When the footage continued , Van Dam can be seen sipping champagne from the bottle as the two girls were underneath the covers with their legs hanging out .

So , preparing for a lengthy spring 2020 tour for her 15th effort , The Medicine Show , is n't a big deal . Four or five quality outfits ? Check . Workout shoes ? Of course . Rice cooker ? Long story , keep reading . We 're not exactly sure what the Grammy and Oscar winner has planned on packing for The Melissa Etheridge Cruise on October 20 to 26 , but whatever it is , you can bet it wo n't be stuffy . No , this voyage , with stops to places like Key West and Ocho Rios , Jamaica , on the itinerary , promises to be informal , funny and filled with good music . But before hopping onto to the proud Kansas native 's website to reserve your own ocean-view cabin aboard the Norwegian Pearl , read below as Etheridge discusses cruise details , career highlights , packing tips and the Forbes Travel Guide-rated restaurant she ca n't get enough of . I 've been on my share of cruises , but I have n't been on a Melissa Etheridge cruise . This is a special cruise ; it really is . I resisted for a long time the cruise thing . I was like , `` No , no . That 's not rock 'n' roll . '' I just did n't want to . And then , finally , I was convinced that I could do it my way . I had said , `` Look , if I could do it my way , if I could have all the things I want , then maybe I 'll go . '' We 've done it three times now , and it 's just gotten better and better . Obviously , the crowd is largely made up of women , but men are completely welcome . And they 're of all types : there 're gay , straight , everything in between . It 's not separated at all . It is very much welcome to everyone . And that is one thing that I want to very much emphasize . Yes , of course , there will be a lot of lesbians , but that 's the way we roll . But if you 've ever been around a lot of lesbians , -LSB- you know that -RSB- we 're a lot of fun . It 's like swimming with dolphins -- it 's quite a lot of fun ! And the music is the focus . Last year we had kind of a '90s -LSB- feel with -RSB- Joan Osborne , Paula Cole and Shawn Colvin . This year , we kind of have a little younger , hipper thing with -LSB- indie band -RSB- Tegan and Sara and -LSB- comedian -RSB- Tig Notaro . I just love inviting fans and groups that I see in my travels , and artists that I really think would be fun to watch live . That 's what it 's about -- the live music . I 'll do different songs than I normally do because you know when I come to your town that might be the only time that you 're going to see me . So yeah , I 'm going to do all the hits at every show I do . But on a boat full of people who are going to see at least two shows , if not more , on the boat , I 'm going to do songs that I have n't done in years . We do a lot of fun things on the boat and , you know , the things that matter to me , like health . I went through breast cancer 15 years ago , and I am 15 years cancer-free now . It 's important to me that people know that there are things you can do to help your chances of not being sick . So , we really kind of sprinkle that in all the things -LSB- on the cruise -RSB- . And the one thing I 'm so proud of is that people have said that they just feel good on the boat , that it 's welcoming . Between shows , are you off by yourself or are you interacting with the guests ? My time is really scheduled , but I consider the whole seven days that I 'm on the boat work . If I 'm not doing a show , I 'm introducing other artists . There 's -LSB- also -RSB- a meet-and-greet , where I meet everyone and take a picture with them . That 's a lot . That 's several hours . We do schedule time off that my wife and I can sit on the deck and just chill . But I am a part of the cruise . I do n't hide . After a while , people get used to seeing me . The production company that does this -LSB- cruise -RSB- is called Sixthman . They know how to do a show like this really well . It 's a lot of work but we really do hyperserve the fans . It 's a lot of fun . You 've put in the work for decades to get to the point where you can headline a cruise . What are some of the things that you 've done in your career that put the biggest smiles on your face ? When I look at being able to do a cruise , I know it 's because I put , first and foremost , my priority of being known as a live-entertainment act , to be known as someone that -LSB- makes fans say -RSB- , `` Oh , I have to see this before ... '' or `` Oh , I 've heard so much about how good this show is that I want to go see it . '' I 've been able to survive what the music industry has gone through . No matter which record companies come and go , I can still go to a town , put on a show , touch people and they want to come back and see me . People see me multiple times . And that 's priceless to me . I 'm so blessed , so , so blessed -- from performing with Bruce Springsteen , my idol , to -LSB- participating in -RSB- Woodstock \u201994 to performing for the past four presidents . I have n't performed for ... well , actually , before -LSB- Donald Trump -RSB- was president , I performed for him , but I did n't know he was in the audience . So , you know , just the opportunity to walk my life and make my choices and be the true person I am and still have a career , I 'm just blessed . The Medicine Show tour is coming up . What is the toughest part about being on the road ? The travel can be wearing , but that 's the challenge . My wife and I have gotten really good at cutting it down to me wearing four things . We 've really gotten our clothing set . Health becomes super important so we have a routine . We have workouts that we do . It 's a very scheduled routine thing , which we end up enjoying and we do very well . We do love seeing new places . On days off , we 'll go to restaurants . We are quite foodies and we love to check out the female chefs in different cities and check out their food . We enjoy that . Speaking of food , it appears that the tour is making a lot of stops on the East Coast and the South . Which cities stand out with really good restaurants ? -LSB- This tour -RSB- is a lot of New York City , Boston and New Jersey , and then we go South . Gosh , I 'm trying to think . We 're big Tom Colicchio fans . When we 're in -LSB- Manhattan -RSB- , Gramercy Tavern is probably our favorite restaurant in the city ... Oh , I 'm blanking . Just like when people ask me who I 'm listening to , I ca n't ever remember anything ! Do you bring a lot of healthy things with you on the road to eat or do you seek out restaurants with healthy menu items on them ? On my workdays , the routine sees us working out in the morning and then we have amenities riders at the hotels that ask for lemons , oat milk and avocados . We carry a little rice cooker that we make oatmeal in . We go through a couple -LSB- rice cookers -RSB- a tour because it 's a rough road . So , every morning we have oatmeal with oat milk and probably have a little raw honey . That 's routine . Then we go to the gig and we have our catering there . But on our days off , we will do the oatmeal in the morning , but we love to find food in every town . When you 're touring or on vacation , what are some things you pack -- well , besides a rice cooker ? I learned to be very light with my carry-on . So , my carry-on is going to have my iPad , my headphones , a hat and scarf . Our bags are going to have clothes in one and then there 's another one that has the rice cooker , my workout shoes and -LSB- this workout tool -RSB- called a Hydrovolt . It 's a massager . It 's like a thumper massager . You use that on your legs and back , right ? Yeah , yeah , yeah ! That 's a big saver .

Jeffery T. Wilson , 53 , 7 Sunny Drive , was arraigned Wednesday in Fayette County Common Pleas Court and pleaded `` not guilty '' to one count of first-degree felony rape , one count of second-degree felony pandering obscenity involving a minor , and 61 counts of fourth-degree felony pandering obscenity involving a minor . Just after 1:30 a.m. Dec. 30 , the Washington Police Department received a complaint about the man later identified as Wilson . An employee at the Holiday Inn Express , 101 Courthouse Parkway , advised that two young girls were upset and seeking help because `` their parent/guardian was walking around the hotel nude , '' according to reports . Police arrived and made contact with the girls , who told officers that Wilson was `` extremely drunk and scaring them . '' The two also said they called their biological mother to pick them up from the hotel . Police were also told that Wilson was nude in front the girls and that he was urinating all over the hotel room . When police went to the room , the door was propped open , reports said . Once inside , police said a strong odor of urine and alcohol was coming from the room . Officers attempted to wake Wilson as he was now asleep on the bed . After yelling for him to respond and shaking him , Wilson finally woke up but could not formulate a sentence , according to reports . He had to be assisted up and to his feet prior to his arrest . Police spoke with the juveniles further , but officers were not able to determine why the girls were brought to the hotel . Several empty beer bottles and a bottle of rum were observed in the room . Wilson was arrested on two counts of endangering children , and was transported to the Fayette County Jail . On Dec. 31 , police obtained a search warrant for Wilson 's cell phone and two memory cards . Police said that photographs and videos of a naked juvenile , who was one of the victims in the hotel room , were on the memory cards . One of the photos also allegedly showed Wilson making sexual contact with one of the girls . Police interviewed Wilson and he allegedly admitted to making sexual contact with the girl while she was sleeping , reports said . According to the grand jury indictment , the alleged rape occurred from July 25 to July 26 , 2018 . Wilson 's jury trial has been set for March 24 . He is being held in the Fayette County Jail on a $ 128,000 bond .

Chrissy Teigen 's wardrobe malfunction photo is n't what it seems . The model , 34 , took to her Instagram on Wednesday , Jan. 15 , to post a picture of her in a fancy AF living room . The snap showed her in a black robe with a towel wrapped around her head as she posed with her leg up on an ornate couch . Predicting that trolls were going to accuse her of a wardrobe malfunction , Teigen also explained in her caption that her nipple was not showing in the photo and that she was fully clothed . `` it 's not a nip . my nipples are unfortunately much lower , '' she wrote . This is n't the first time fans have accused the Lip Sync Battle cohost of having a wardrobe malfunction . At the 2017 American Music Awards , Teigen walked the carpet with her husband , John Legend , in a high-slit dress . Photos from the event show Teigen holding the dress together , so it does n't reveal too much of her body .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrVys6k", "title": "Sundance 2020 : 20 Must-See Films and Series At This Year 's Festival , From ` Zola ' to ` Kajillionaire '", "content": "This year 's Sundance Film Festival is mere days from unspooling in snowy Park City , Utah and , with it comes a brand new year of indie filmmaking -LRB- and , with the expansion of the festival 's Indie Episodics section , plenty of television , too -RRB- to get excited about . As ever , the annual festival is playing home to dozens of feature films , short offerings , and technologically-influenced experiences , and while there 's plenty to anticipate seeing , we 've waded through the lineup to pick out the ones we 're most looking forward to checking out . From returning filmmakers like Dee Rees , Sean Durkin , David France , Janicza Bravo , and Miranda July , to new-to-the-fest names like Radha Blank , Ekwa Msangi , and Florian Zeller , this year 's festival promises a bevy of big treats and perhaps even bigger surprises . Here 's what we ca n't wait to see . This year 's festival runs from January 23 -- February 2 in Park City , Utah . Check out all of our coverage of the festival right here . `` Bloody Nose , Empty Pockets '' It 's the last night of The Roaring 20s , a dive bar in the shadows of the Las Vegas Strip , and patrons and employees alike gather as the watering hole readies to close its doors for good -LRB- or do they ? -RRB- -- all while offering a glimpse of people as they face the uncertainty of America at the end of 2016 . The Documentary Competition entry comes from filmmaking brothers Bill and Turner Ross , who previously won the Sundance Special Jury Prize for Verite Filmmaking in 2015 for their `` Western , '' the third installment of their Americana trilogy . The duo have always straddled the line between fiction and fact , and while `` Bloody Nose , Empty Pockets '' might sound like just another slice of white collar life , trust that the brothers have some tricks up their sleeves with this one . -- CL `` Boys State '' Documentary Competition feature `` Boys State '' invites viewers to see what they can learn from a group of 17-year-old Texas boys as they form their own mock local , county , and state governments from the ground up . The film is co-directed by Jesse Moss -- who previously won a Sundance Special Jury Prize for Intuitive Filmmaking for his `` The Overnighters , '' an intimate look at life in North Dakota oil fields -- and Amanda McBaine , who also produced that earlier project . The documentary is produced by the newly-formed documentary-focused Concordia Studio , led by `` Inconvenient Truth '' filmmaker -LRB- and fellow Sundance regular -RRB- Davis Guggenheim . -- CL `` City So Real '' Two years after debuting his acclaimed Starz docuseries `` America to Me '' at Sundance , director Steve James returns to Park City with another Chicago-set story -- this time , swapping a suburban high school for a political backdrop . `` City So Real '' tracks the 2019 mayoral campaign , the coinciding trial of a police officer who killed Laquan McDonald , and how the two illustrate both a divided city and a divided country . James has a talent for finding the unique aspects of his subjects , be it the individuals who share their lives or how those lives define their hometown , and yet his work never ignores the bigger picture . `` City So Real '' marks his second foray into episodic documentaries , and given the caliber of his first outing , it 's a must-see at this year 's festival . -- BT `` Dick Johnson Is Dead '' For cinematic nonfiction fans , the unveiling of Kirsten Johnson 's `` Cameraperson '' follow-up easily ranks as one of the most anticipated films of 2020 . Dick Johnson is the filmmaker 's 86-year old father , a former psychiatrist suffering from dementia who faces the end of life through cinematic exploration alongside his talented daughter . The film mixes fantasy and nonfiction , as the duo confront death by staging his death and bringing him back to life , in a film that Johnson told Variety would be a mix of `` Groundhog Day , '' Buster Keaton , Jacques Tati , and `` Jackass . '' As wildly fun as that all sounds , it is hard to not think of the incredibly powerful images Johnson created of her mother facing dementia in `` Cameraperson , '' and the way that film tackled the big questions of nonfiction representation . In short : do n't assume this Netflix - and Megan Ellison-backed film wo n't strike that same balance between being as profound as it is entertaining . -- CO `` Farewell Amor '' Tanzanian-American filmmaker Ekwa Msangi makes her feature film debut with `` Farewell Amor , '' which follows an estranged Angolan immigrant family in Brooklyn as they struggle to overcome the emotional distance between them . Father Walter is trying to let go of a previous relationship , and is joined in the U.S. by his wife , Esther , and teen daughter , Sylvia , who are both struggling to adapt to life in a new country . Eventually , they overcome personal and political hurdles when they learn to rely on the muscle memory of Angolan dance to rediscover what they lost after being apart for such a long time . The film is a universal immigrant story , presenting the unique perspectives of three characters bound together by a shared history . It is an intimate and personal look at the kind of intergenerational story that has defined America from its very beginnings . -- TO `` The Father '' This twisty father-daughter drama is co-written by Christopher Hampton -LRB- `` Dangerous Liaisons , '' `` Atonement '' -RRB- and French playwright Florian Zeller , adapting his hit play and directing for the first time . -LRB- The 2015 French adaptation was entitled `` Floride '' and starred Jean Rochefort -RRB- . Anthony Hopkins is an aging Londoner who is wrestling not only with the caretakers hired by his concerned daughter -LRB- Olivia Colman -RRB- but his hold on reality . How long will her husband -LRB- Rufus Sewell -RRB- put up with her devotion to her father as he heads into senility ? There 's plenty for Hopkins and Colman to dig into in this moving and unpredictable Oscar bait drama . -- AT `` The 40-Year-Old Version '' Playwright and screenwriter Radha Blank -LRB- `` She 's Got ta Have It , '' `` Empire '' -RRB- writes , directs , and stars in her debut feature about a down-on-her-luck New York playwright who decides to reinvent herself and salvage her artistic voice the only way she knows how : by becoming a rapper at age 40 . The film follows its protagonist as she dithers between the worlds of New York 's theater and hip hop scenes , places where the voices of black women are often marginalized . When a play she 's been writing finally gets some lift , she puts recording a rap demo tape on hold , and considers compromising her voice for career success . It 's the quintessential plight of an artist having to contend with either `` selling out '' or being true to oneself , but told from the POV of a protagonist rarely seen on screen in a leading performance . Shot on black-and-white 35mm film , it 's Blank 's love letter to her beloved hometown and to the canon of New York City films . The film counts Lena Waithe -LRB- `` Queen & Slim '' -RRB- among its producers . -- TO `` Hillary '' Despite winning the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes , Hillary Clinton has been painted again and again as a polarizing figure ; a controversial politician ; a person plagued by presumptions and scandal . With another presidential election on the horizon , filmmaker Nanette Burstein -LRB- `` On the Ropes '' -RRB- looks to sift fact from fiction in a four-part limited series that 's being dubbed a `` comprehensive '' chronicle of Clinton 's life and career . Previously unreleased footage from her campaign is interwoven throughout , tying together interviews with Bill Clinton , Chelsea Clinton , friends , journalists , opponents , and Clinton herself , as the docuseries builds to the leader 's defining moment . Our collective fascination with the 2016 election may drive us to watch , but what Burstein does with her access will prove whether `` Hillary '' sheds new light on one of the most recognizable female figures in American history . `` Hillary '' will premiere March 6 on Hulu . -- BT `` Kajillionaire '' It 's been nine long years since writer , filmmaker , Instagram auteur , and iconoclastic woman of her times Miranda July last directed a feature -LRB- that would be 2011 's shatteringly fantastical breakup drama `` The Future '' -RRB- , and while her delicate recent performance in Josephine Decker 's `` Madeline 's Madeline '' helped temper our withdrawal , it also reminded us just how much the movies have missed her energy . And now -- not a minute too soon -- July is finally back with a movie all her own : A heist comedy about two con artists -LRB- Richard Jenkins and Debra Winger -RRB- who 've spent 26 years training their only daughter -LRB- Evan Rachel Wood -RRB- to be the world 's greatest con artist . Trouble rears its head when the girl becomes attached to the family 's next mark -LRB- Gina Rodriguez -RRB- , and begins to resent the choices that her parents have made for them all . It 's mighty enticing premise for anyone with fond memories of `` Matchstick Men , '' and there 's no doubt that July will transform this story when she filters it through the prism of her own bittersweet imagination . On the heels of `` The Future '' and July 's sublime debut `` Me and You and Everyone We Know , '' we have every reason to suspect that `` Kajillionaire '' will be an embarrassment of riches . -- DE `` The Last Thing He Wanted '' Dee Rees ' Netflix adaptation of author Joan Didion 's 1996 political thriller `` The Last Thing He Wanted '' stars Anne Hathaway as a journalist who stops her coverage of the 1984 U.S. Presidential election to care for her dying father . And in an unusual turn of events , she inherits his position as an arms dealer for the U.S. Government in Central America . Rees directs from a script she co-wrote with Marco Villalobos . Willem Dafoe , Toby Jones , Ben Affleck , Rosie Perez , and Edi Gathegi round out the stacked supporting cast . The film is slated to premiere at Sundance later this month , and will be released by Netflix later this year . Rees ' first film since `` Mudbound , '' which also debuted at Sundance , is another starry thriller from a filmmaker who excels at juggling difficult material with actors playing against type , so there is reason to believe she has pulled off something special here . -- TO `` The Nest '' Filmmaker Sean Durkin made a splash at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival for his eerie debut `` Martha Marcy May Marlene , '' which won him the Dramatic Directing Award and launched the career of star Elizabeth Olsen . Since then , Durkin has mainly directed television -LRB- `` Southcliffe '' -RRB- and produced the films of his pals through their indie collective Borderline Films -LRB- `` James White , '' `` Christine , '' `` The Eyes of My Mother '' -RRB- . Finally , Durkin returns to the director 's chair for `` The Nest , '' debuting in Sundance 's Premieres section . He also wrote the film , starring Jude Law and Carrie Coon as a British entrepreneur and his American wife who , in the 1980s , flee suburban America for England . Increasing isolation , moral rot , and self-destruction send the couple on a collision course toward something awful . With a stellar cast and a high-profile Sundance berth , `` The Nest '' is already appointment viewing in Park City this year . -- RL `` Never Rarely Sometimes Always '' In the wake of both `` It Felt Like Love '' and `` Beach Rats , '' Eliza Hittman has announced herself as a master of intimate , aching portraits of young adulthood and all its awful desire . The New York filmmaker 's third film promises more of that , with a dramatic twist on her thematic obsessions and a brand new pair of rising stars in the form of Talia Ryder and Sidney Flanigan . Cast as teenage cousins , the film follows the duo as they travel from rural Pennsylvania to the bright lights -LRB- and bureaucratic BS -RRB- of New York in the hopes of obtaining an abortion not available in their hometown , a timely story that Hittman will inevitably approach with her characteristic care and honesty . Look for the film to pop at Sundance before Focus Features shares it with the rest of the country in March . -- KE `` The Nowhere Inn '' Behind-the-scenes mockumentaries about rock stars are nothing new , but the fusion of creative voices in `` The Nowhere Inn '' promises something different : The unclassifiable Sundance midnight entry ostensibly follows Annie Clark -- otherwise known as St. Vincent -- on a tour while the singer grapples with how to portray her authentic self , while her best pal Carrie Brownstein tails her with a camera . But this is not your average behind-the-scenes peek : Directed by `` Portlandia '' regular Bill Benz and co-written by Clark and Brownstein , this hybrid curiosity promises an amusing and inquisitive trip down the rabbit hole of fame and self-reflection , jumping between its two central characters ' perspectives as the nature of their project takes a series of unusual dreamlike twists . Clark and Brownstein have collaborated in the past , from a series of comedy videos about what it 's like to be labeled `` a woman in music '' to the St. Vincent-produced Sleater Kinney album `` Love , '' but this cinematic hybrid suggests their most ambitious experiment to date , a wry meditation on what it means for a performer to stop performing and reveal some measure of truth . The decision to play the movie at midnight points to the potential for an enigmatic , formally daring work that could position both performers in a whole new light . -- EK `` Omniboat '' Over the last eight years , an intrepid young group of Miami 's brightest filmmakers and artists have been quietly revitalizing the city 's film scene . The Borscht collective has included and supported work from such filmmakers as Sebastian Silva , Terence Nance , and Celia Rowlson-Hall , while producing some of the most inventive short films to be made in the US . In less than a decade , Borscht has sent an impressive 17 shorts to Sundance . This year , Borscht will premiere its first feature film in Sundance 's forward-looking NEXT section . The anthology film features sections directed by Nance , Rowlson-Hall , The Daniels , Hannah Fiddell , the Meza Brothers , as well as founding collective members Lucas Leyva and Jillian Mayer . Instead of raising money for a film , Borscht pitched investors on helping them buy a speedboat , which proved an easier sell . The result is a fantasy-fueled adventure revolving around the many exploits of the boat , which boldly takes advantage of Miami 's unique visuals , local celebrities , and attitude . It 's sure to have Park City talking . -- JD `` Shirley '' Everybody 's favorite woman-on-the-verge Elisabeth Moss returns to the big screen to raise hell once again , this time as self-destructive , midcentury gothic fiction writer Shirley Jackson , perennial chainsmoker and binge-drinker . Michael Stuhlbarg co-stars as her professor husband , Stanley Hyman , in this film that finds their lives rocked by the arrival of a young couple -LRB- Logan Lerman and Odessa Young -RRB- who become fodder for Jackson 's next novel . `` Shirley '' is directed by Josephine Decker , who 's been stirring the festival circuit since her 2013 debut `` Butter on the Latch , '' followed by her erotic avant-garde thriller `` Thou Wast Mild and Lovely '' -LRB- 2014 -RRB- , and the meta drama `` Madeline 's Madeline , '' from Sundance 2018 . Decker 's expressionist vision and Moss ' gift for inhabiting women in meltdown mode portend a heavenly cinematic match -- though also one probably rooted in hell . -- RL `` Time '' With `` Time , '' filmmaker Garrett Bradley returns to the topics of love and incarceration that she so ably explored in her 2017 New York Times Op-Doc `` Alone . '' In 1997 , Fox and Rob Richardson were young newlyweds arrested after a botched robbery . `` Time '' is the story of how Fox , after serving a three-and-a-half year prison sentence , has dedicated her life to raising their six children while fighting to get Rob , who was sentenced to 60 years , out of prison . Bradley 's 2019 Sundance short `` America '' demonstrated an explosive cinematic talent creating a radical , beautiful reimagination of African-American big screen representation . `` Time '' looks to be an evolution of that lyrical style as Bradley captures Fox forging the bonds of family through the walls of incarceration via a combination of family video diaries -LRB- which Fox created for Rob -RRB- , gorgeous black-and-white cinematography , voiceover , and an overlapping time structure . This film has the potential to land somewhere at the intersection of `` Hale County '' and `` Beale Street , '' while announcing -LRB- for those not already exposed -RRB- the arrival of a major new filmmaking talent . -- CO `` The Truffle Hunters '' A lot of the documentaries that premiere at Sundance tackle high-profile subjects or timely issues readymade to generate buzz . But the lineup often has plenty of room for smaller non-fiction discoveries , especially in its World Cinema Documentary Competition . That 's where the acclaimed `` Honeyland '' premiered in 2019 before winning the section and eventually scoring two Oscar nominations . This year , `` Truffle Hunters '' stands a good chance of filling that slot . Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw return to Sundance two years after `` The Last Race '' with the unusual story of elderly men in the Italian forests of Northern Italy on a quest to find the white Alba truffle . The movie follows these quirky experts as they search for these rare , valuable and utterly tasty objects to serve the whims of the highbrow restaurant scene , while battling the impact of climate change and business concerns on their insular profession . As with `` Honeyland , '' the documentary promises a singular look at the unwieldy relationship between rural and urban worlds -- with adorable truffle-hunting dogs to boot . -- EK `` Us Kids '' Kim A. Snyder 's 2016 documentary `` Newtown '' was a deeply sobering portrait of life after death in a Connecticut town that has become synonymous with mass shootings . And while that film was every bit as powerful and sickening as its description might suggest , Snyder knew that it would n't be the final word on the subject ; that America would sooner ignore its wounds than meaningfully reckon with them . In the aftermath of the Parkland massacre in 2018 , Snyder recognized another opportunity to engage with the survivors of our country 's self-inflicted violence , and explore how they try to make use of their trauma . Snyder embedded herself with the Marjory Stonemason Douglas High School students as they forged themselves into the generational activists they never aspired to be , and the film she culled together from 18 months of footage promises to be an intimate profile of grief , action , and a few young Americans who refused to be shellshocked into silence . -- DE `` Welcome to Chechnya '' The latest documentary from `` How to Survive a Plague '' documentarian David France , `` Welcome to Chechnya '' investigates a group of fearless activists brave enough to confront Russia 's virulent anti-LGBTQ pogrom . France gained extraordinary access partly by deploying innovative VFX technology to mask the identities of his subjects . These fearless residents of the repressive and closed Russian republic go undercover to expose Chehnya 's underreported atrocities , and they also rescue victims via safe houses and visa assistance in order to help them escape . HBO scooped up the film prior to its Sundance world premiere , so interested viewers need not wait too long to explore France 's latest heartbreaker . -- AT `` Zola '' At a time when books and articles are optioned before they 're even published , a viral Twitter thread is the closest thing to a slam dunk this industry could hope for . `` Okay listen up . This story long . So I met this white bitch at Hooters ... '' begins Aziah `` Zola '' King 's epic story , which follows a wild trip King took to Tampa with a fellow exotic dancer and her boyfriend , and involves a Nigerian pimp , a potential murder , and a suicide attempt from a four-story window . King 's account soon began trending as #TheStory , garnering fans like Solange Knowles , Missy Elliot , and Ava DuVernay . Producers Christine Vachon , Kara Baker , David Hinojosa , Gia Walsh , and Dave Franco wisely saw the potential . They enlisted `` Lemon '' writer/director Janicza Bravo to direct and co-write the screenplay with playwright Jeremy O. Harris , whose `` Slave Play '' is currently making waves on Broadway . King shares story credit with Rolling Stone 's David Kushner , whose 2015 article clarified some of the embellishments in the original tale . The film stars Taylour Paige , Riley Keough , and Colan Domingo , among others . It also features an original score by Oscar nominee Mica Levi , whose participation is an endorsement in itself . With such pedigree behind and in front of the camera , as well as the 21st century IP equivalent of a Jane Austen novel , `` Zola '' is sure to sizzle . -- JD Popular on IndieWire Sign Up : Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news !

The ex-wife to Scottie Pippen and former `` Real Housewives of Miami '' star took to Instagram this week to show off her weight loss . Larsa , 45 , was showing Instagram her on-point fashion sense , but she 'd definitely picked a look designed to draw the eye to her fit and curvy frame . The snap has been racking up all kinds of likes -- unsurprising , given that Larsa was looking red hot . ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ` Lost A Few Lbs ' Larsa Pippen/Instagram Larsa 's photo showed her in selfie mode and inside her pristine and luxurious home . The blonde was posing in a super-tight and tiny red mini dress in snakeskin , with the color palette also extending to black and orange . The long-sleeved and high-neck finish may have been conservative , but this was n't a nun 's outfit . Larsa 's mini dress was , indeed , mini . The thigh-grazing number was flaunting the star 's gym-honed legs , and Larsa had whacked on a strappy pair of heels to elongate her pins . A caption from Larsa confirmed that the scale was down . `` Lost a few lbs . . Dress : @prettylittlething , '' she wrote . Fans Think She Looks Like A Total Snack Larsa Pippen/Instagram Larsa 's post did n't take long to rake in the comments -- and the likes . Over 21,000 had been clocked by the time the sun rose on Thursday morning . Fans seemed to think this reality face looked A-OK : `` Damn you 're fine , '' one user wrote . `` Hard work is paying off ! Keeping killing it ! '' another said . `` Did n't need to , '' one fan told the star , adding that her body was `` fire '' via emoji .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrWMhn6", "title": "Netflix 's Docuseries ` Cheer ' Will Totally Change the Way You Think About Cheerleading", "content": "`` Cheerleading sucks , '' one cheerleader says to another in the fifth episode of Netflix 's six-part documentary series , Cheer , which follows the elite Navarro College team as it preps for another national championship competition in Daytona Beach . Watching the show , it 's hard to disagree with that statement . Cheerleading sucks , but not in the way that you think it does -- not because it 's quote-unquote lame or because it 's filled , as the stereotype goes , with bitchy popular girls . It sucks because of the frequent concussions and the dislocated bones and the fractured ribs . Just after being told `` cheerleading sucks , '' cheerleader Morgan Simianer goes to the emergency room . She 's told that she needs to stop cheering or she could potentially crack her ribs and puncture her organs . She refuses . But cheerleading , according to Cheer , is also beautiful . It 's a miraculous athletic achievement , in which bodies are pushed to an extreme in order to literally fly through the air . It 's also a source of solace for the young men and women of Navarro on screen , a chosen family ruled over by their coach Monica Aldama , an intense den mother , who works her kids hard but loves them deeply . Cheer puts you through the ringer . I spent half the time watching in a tense full-body cringe , anticipating disaster as the Navarro cheerleaders practiced their ridiculously hard pyramid , yelping when someone hit the ground . -LRB- And a lot of people hit the ground . -RRB- Watching Cheer is also a multi-platform experience . As the countless `` where to find the cast on social media '' posts indicate : Finding and following the stars of the series on Instagram is half the fun . -LRB- It also means you can very well spoil yourself for the grand finale , as I did . -RRB- View this post on Instagram Back and better than ever #navarrocheer #rebelathleticcheer A post shared by Jeremiah Harris -LRB- @jerry . h.arris -RRB- Nearly 20 years after Bring It On 's debut , cheerleading is having something of a moment on TV . Over on basic cable , you can watch USA 's Dare Me , based on the Megan Abbott book , which acknowledges the athletic rigor of the sport , but couches it in a sexy mystery . Executive produced and directed by Greg Whiteley -- who was behind Netflix 's highly lauded football docuseries Last Chance U -- Cheer does n't really have time for that sort of drama . In fact , it largely aims to desexualize the sport . Though Cheer aims to highlight the sport 's athleticism above all else , it does n't lack an emotional pull . Cheer succeeds mostly on the strength of the characters it chooses to highlight . At the center of all of this is Monica , who stomps around Corsicana , Texas in little boots like she owns the town . -LRB- And she sort of does . -RRB- Monica is Coach and Tami Taylor rolled up all into one . She 's a born-and-bred Corsicana who had dreams of going to New York and working in business , but found herself tied to her hometown after starting a family with her high school sweetheart . She runs the Navarro team like a small empire , molding the members into the best of the best . She 's deadpan and highly critical , but a softie when she needs to be . I also genuinely feared her pyramid might be too hard , given how many injuries it spawned . Then there are the cheerleaders themselves . Far and away the breakout star is Jerry Harris . It feels weird to say that someone who is quite literally a cheerleader is also a figurative cheerleader , but that 's who Jerry is . He 's a supportive sweetheart rooting hard for every member of his team even through internal strife . -LRB- While the team consists of 40 people , only 20 get to `` make mat , '' meaning get to compete at Daytona . -RRB- He quickly emerged as a fan favorite online along with the other athletes Whiteley and his team chose to highlight . It 's hard not to root for Morgan Simianer , who does n't have the training of some of her peers due to an absent father and unmoored upbringing . Lexi Brumback is a remarkable tumbler with a history of bad behavior , and her early disillusionment with the rah-rah Navarro spirit is relatable but it makes her ultimate dedication all the more exciting . It also means that the epilogue , in which she 's kicked out of school for being in possession of illegal substances , is all the more heartbreaking . La'Darius Marshall is a great performer with a highly critical attitude that we eventually learn was born as a defense mechanism . Gabi Butler comes in as the pre-appointed influencer of the group , a `` cheerlebrity '' who has been famous in these circles for years with a pair of stage parents who have seemingly little regard for her mounting exhaustion . Gabi , meanwhile , is a trooper even despite being constantly pressured . It 's easy to develop affection for people who are n't as prominently featured : Sherbs ! Jade ! Austin ! View this post on Instagram Honey , I 'm home #fiofmu A post shared by Lexi Brumback -LRB- @lexisbrumback -RRB- Gabi 's presence is also a reminder that there 's a narrative beyond what Whiteley 's cameras capture happening on Instagram where there are endorsement deals and loving tributes to fellow teammates , glamor shots , and more cool stunts . Following the Navarro team on their adventures post-series is part of the fun . How else would you know that Lexi is back on the squad ? Or that Jerry is seemingly thriving ? But the social media fandom that 's grown out of Cheer also feels at odds with the tone of the show which is both celebratory and deeply melancholy . There are beats that Whiteley and his crew leave dangling , and I 'm not just talking about `` FIOFMU , '' the mysterious acronym adorning the uniforms of the Navarro teams . There 's an acknowledgement of how the conservative values -LRB- read : biases -RRB- of Corsicana are in conflict with the ethos of the Navarro team and the diversity of its members , but it 's a matter that feels largely unexplored . Monica is staunchly supportive of the gay members of her team , but it 's clear other members of this tiny community are not . Fundamentally , Cheer is about how impressive and futile it all is . Navarro 's not exactly the end of the road for its cheerleaders ' careers , but there 's not much farther to go after it . -LRB- Cheering for the NFL is not the same thing . -RRB- It 's a sport that has no professional equivalent , but leaves its players with broken bodies and few opportunities . Cheerleading is awesome . Cheerleading also sucks . Need help finding something to watch ?

'' developmental psychologist Edward Tronick , Ph.D. asked In a paper called Emotions and Emotional Communication in Infants . It 's an important question , and the answer lies in large part with the quality of emotional communication between parent and child . We do n't get this important education in emotions in our formal schooling , yet we really need it to do right by our children . Emotional Communication Starts at Birth As soon as an infant is born , emotional communication begins with the mother -LRB- or mother-figure -RRB- . Historically , because infants ca n't speak , they were thought of as not having emotions and not being sensitive to their surroundings . Luckily , we now know that the opposite is true . Like the interconnecting roots of adjacent trees , adults and infants are inextricably connected to one another and in constant communication with each other through their emotions . How a parent responds to their baby from moment-to-moment determines what emotions that baby will experience and have to cope with . Moreover , the way these interactions play out greatly influences how an infant will behave toward others as they grow into childhood and adulthood . Most of this communication is actually non-verbal . Even as adults , humans communicate primarily without words . The tone of voice , facial expressions , eye gaze , and body posture are evaluated on the deepest levels of our brain . The words matter less . Being Gentle is Important No matter what age we are , when non-verbal and verbal communication is positive and respectful , the human body responds with calm and wellbeing . In that state , we are able to connect positively with others . However , when communication is harsh , tense , hurtful , threatening , dismissive , and/or humiliating , it creates tension . The nervous system jolts into fight/flight/freeze states of alertness , while the mind works to defend itself from emotional distress . In this kind of state , we retreat inward and the ability to connect with others becomes compromised . While children of all ages are like sponges soaking up the environment with their five senses , an infant 's nervous system is most sensitive . The environment -LRB- which at first is synonymous with the mother , then expands to include others as the baby grows -RRB- invisibly `` pushes and pulls '' on an infant 's raw and vulnerable nervous system . The brain-mind-body emotionally responds with two basic messages : you are SAFE or you are in DANGER . Everything the infant sees , hears , feels , tastes , and touches will affect the baby -- especially when emotions are triggered . Get Educated in Emotions This requires parents to be quite self-aware and to monitor their emotions and reactions in the best interest of their infant 's development . To work on one 's emotional responses is to care about creating an adult with the best possible emotional health . This takes time and is not easy to do , especially in busy families and hectic lives . In short , it 's vitally important for parents to do two things : 1 -RRB- Maintain an attuned and accepting emotional connection with their child -- regardless of the child 's behavior . Attunement describes how reactive a person is to another 's emotional needs and moods . A person who is well attuned will respond with appropriate language and behaviors based on another person 's emotional state 2 -RRB- When ruptures in the connection do occur , which they will , it 's equally important that a parent works to repair the rupture and restore an emotional connection that feels safe and soothing to the child . We do this by being empathic , warm , loving , accepting , curious , and playful . This sounds difficult -- and in practice , it 's even harder , because even as infants , children affect their parents ' own emotions and behavior right back . Example Tronick , to illustrate the importance of emotional attunement , asked us to imagine two infant-mother pairs playing the game of peek-a-boo . In the first scenario , the infant abruptly turns away from his mother as the game became too stimulating for him . He sucks his thumb and stares into space with a dull facial expression . The mother stops playing and sits back watching her infant . After a few seconds , the infant turns back to her with an interested and inviting expression . The mother moves closer , smiles , and says in a high-pitched exaggerated voice , `` Oh , now you 're back ! '' They smile and coo in response to each other . Once again , the infant reinserts his thumb and looks away . The mother waits again . After a few seconds , the infant turns back to her , and they greet each other with big smiles . In the second situation , the infant turns away , but the mother does n't wait long enough for the infant to come back on his own . She leans over into the infant 's line of vision while clicking her tongue to attract his attention . The infant , however , ignores the mother and continues to look away -LRB- He is trying to calm himself by breaking eye contact -RRB- . Not picking up on his need , the mother persists and moves her head closer to the infant . The infant frowns , fusses , and pushes at the mother 's face . Within seconds he turns even further away from his mother and continues to suck on his thumb . Without focusing on who is responsible for any `` mistakes '' in the above interactions , let 's notice how the emotions and behaviors of one lead to the emotions and behaviors of the other . In both scenarios , the infant 's turning away and sucking his thumb is a message to the mother that the infant needs to calm down his nervous system . Even as babies , we instinctually know when we need to lower the `` stimulation '' coming from our environment . A mother is inherently stimulating -- just because she is another person . Each mother respects this communication from her infant by waiting -- at first . But the first mother greets her infant with smiles , waits patiently , and consistently lets her infant determine when he 's ready to reconnect . The relaxed patience of the first mother conveys safety to the infant . He is free to come and go from the connection as he needs . Can you imagine how calming that feels ? This freedom brings forth a deep sense of wellbeing in a child , who learns he can trust others to respect his needs . The second mother , on the other hand , failed to pick up the cue that her infant was not ready to connect again . She likely felt angry , anxious , sad , longing , or had another emotion that interfered with her infant 's need for distance in that moment . This mis-attuned reaction of the mother 's leads to a rupture or break in their connection . The mother 's `` intrusion '' made it harder for the baby 's nervous system to calm down , prolonging the infant 's disconnection from his mother . Problems arise when interactions leading to ruptures are the norm . The infant grows into a child who expects to be infringed upon and/or emotionally abandoned and develops protective defenses to cope . Tronick found that infants who chronically experienced mis-attunements disengaged more from their mothers and the rest of their environment and distorted their interactions with other people . The kicker is : mis-attunement happens to all parents . Being perfectly attuned just is n't possible -- nor would it be a good thing anyway . What builds emotional security is a parent 's determination to repair ruptures soon after they have occurred . In general , the more emotional stress caused by unrepaired ruptures in connection , the more anxiety , depression , and low confidence the adult that infant grows into will suffer . Parents can `` repair '' ruptures by being mindful of how emotions organize their infant 's and their own behavior . Basic education for parents in emotions and childhood trauma provide tools so a parent can proactively strive for positive connections as they tolerate their own feelings of rejection , disappointment , anger , sadness , and longing . When we ignore an infant 's emotional cues because we do n't understand them or we ca n't tolerate our own responses , we are forcing them to cope alone . But when we respond to those cues appropriately , an infant 's authentic self can emerge and thrive . Want to have an experience that illustrates how all of this affects us in adult relationships ? Imagine having an argument with a partner or a family member . Then , imagine the fallout after that conflict . Let 's say your partner or family member asks for space , or perhaps they just `` feel distant . '' What emotions or physical sensations does that scenario bring up for you ? Are you confident they will `` come back ? '' Do you get anxious/panicky ? Do you get angry ? Does your heartbeat speed up ? Do you get a knot in your stomach ? Do you not notice that they have `` gone away '' -- that there even was a rupture ? Do you feel moved to repair it or dig into a grudge ? Just notice and validate the emotions without judgment . Many adults , like the second mother , might have a hard time tolerating space in a relationship . But throughout our lives , such space is necessary to calm down and recharge our nervous system , so that we can be genuinely connected when we `` come back . '' Now try this again in reverse . Imagine you need space , and you can sense that your partner or friend ca n't tolerate it . What emotions does it bring up for you ? Do you feel guilty ? Angry ? Sad ? Fearful ? All of the above ? Or , can you stay grounded in your most confident self and take the space you need Again , just notice and validate the emotions without judgment . Well done !

There 's nothing like a good shake of the terra to worry your psychic firma . The damn thing shook our world on Oct. 17 , 1989 , but then Carlos Santana showed up about 40 days later to settle the vibe . We all remember where we were when the ground shimmied and shook . I was barking orders at a bunch of scurvy reporters who were trying to sneak out of the office early to catch the first pitch of the Bay Bridge Series . The World Series was supposed to showcase the San Francisco region to legions of baseball fans . The earthquake changed everything in a moment . Buildings and bridges collapsed . People died . Infrastructure was de-frastructured . Tim McCarver shut up for once . I also remember where I was when Santana rocked the Central Coast in a good way . In a healing-vibes way . That would be at the football field at the Watsonville High School on Nov. 26 , about 40 days later . Santana was one of three headliners at three different venues for relief concerts promoted by Bill Graham Presents . The concerts were referred to as `` Earthquake Relief -- It 's Everybody 's Fault . '' The lineup included Bobby McFerrin , Neil Young , Pete Escovedo , Bonnie Raitt and Crosby , Stllls & Nash , among others , at the Cow Palace and in Oakland . Bob Hope even showed up in San Francisco . Tickets were twenty bucks a pop . In Watsonville , in deference to the crowd and the location , entrance to the football field was only $ 5 . To see Santana . With Los Lobos opening . `` People were ready for some entertainment , '' deadpanned Lane Wallace , my go-to Santa Cruz rock swami . This was n't just the new and allegedly improved Santana who got all woo-woo and collaborative on everyone . I know it 's bad mojo to write this out loud , but I 'm not much into the synthesized Santana sharing the stage with some kid from some other band . Give me the hard-charging improvisational percussion-heaven messy Santana any day . He 'd gone off on an experimental phase with all sorts of good intentions and odd consolidations for a while . But the good old Santana showed up in Watsonville on Nov. 26 , 1986 . This was classic , vintage Carlos Santana and the band we all grew up admiring . Armando Peraza was on the congas . Brother Jorge kicked ass with solo after solo on his Fender . Alex Ligertwood was in was in full voice and full hair . It was n't the band he started off with back in 1966 in San Francisco , but it knew its way around the Santana classics . There is great video of the show . All three benefit shows were broadcast live on KQED . -LRB- And , yeah , imagine something like that happening again . -RRB- The Santana video is generous with the crowd shots and there are plenty of sublime scenes . Half of the UC Santa Cruz student body was apparently there . There was a time when the entire set was available on YouTube , but some jerk apparently got it removed . But you can still catch individual performances if you 're handy with a computer keyboard . `` Toussaint Louverture '' is my personal favorite . In fact , if you do n't care for what Carlos and his brother do on `` Toussaint Louverture , '' I do n't even want to know you . Just go away , you monster . But I would n't be true to myself if I did n't at least throw in a paragraph or two about what my favorite guys did that day . What Los Lobos did was this : They opened for Santana and they nearly set off Loma Prieta , the Sequel . The day kicked off with accordion-crazy `` Anselma , '' and the band did n't take a breath until they finished off the final bars of `` La Bamba '' about 60 minutes later . And , in this case , I 'm happy to report good news on the video front . The entire Los Lobos set is still available in one big snatch here . If nothing else , stick it out to watch Cesar Rosas work up a sweat while absolutely shredding the bomb out of `` La Bamba . '' Appropriate to the event , the band ended its eartrhquake relief set with `` Shakin Shakin Shakes . '' Of course . At the end of the day , Earthquake Relief raised $ 2 million . But the main thing was the healing vibes ; the Santana brothers were in the neighborhood for a day . Have something to say about this story ?

Martha Stevens , D-Columbia , becomes law . Stevens said it could create a more positive school environment for LGBTQ students and curb bullying against them . `` I 'm really excited to put this forward and talk to my colleagues about this , '' Stevens said Thursday by phone . The bill filed Tuesday , should it become law , would require the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to work with a statewide advocacy group to develop the curriculum to be offered to schools . The proposal has not been assigned to a committee . Stevens said she has talked with officials at the education department and other educators about the idea . `` I think it 's really important for LGBTQ students to see themselves reflected in society , '' Stevens said . Straight students also would benefit , she said . `` I think it 's important for all students when it comes to equality and different successes for students to learn about contributions of LGBTQ individuals to different parts of society , literature , art and culture , '' Stevens said . LGBTQ students more frequently suffer from depression , low self-esteem and are more likely to miss school , Stevens said in a news release . Stevens said in the interview that if the bill passes , it would be the education department 's discretion as to which statewide LGBTQ group to partner with on the curriculum but PROMO , an organization that has been advocating for the community for more than two decades , would be a good candidate . This is n't meant to take control away from local school boards , Stevens said . It requires the education department to establish a curriculum , but it would be voluntary for local school districts to adopt it . `` I would hope local school districts would see the importance of using it , '' Stevens said . Shira Berkowitz , spokeswoman for PROMO , said the organization would be willing to help the state develop the curriculum if Stevens ' bill becomes law . `` We have really strong connections with educators who can help develop the curriculum , '' Berkowitz said . The LGBTQ curriculum is needed in a state where LGBTQ individuals are n't protected , she said . `` To show these LGBTQ youth they 're valid is the most important thing , '' Berkowitz said . rmckinney@columbiatribune.com 573-815-1719", "url": "https://www.mexicoledger.com/news/20200115/stevens-seeks-lgbtq-curriculum-for-schools", "kws": ["LGBTQ^^curriculum", "LGBTQ^^students", "statewide^^LGBTQ^^group", "LGBTQ", "LGBTQ^^individuals", "educators", "schools", "students", "education^^department", "community", "Secondary^^Education", "advocacy", "Elementary", "society", "Stevens", "bisexual", "gay", "school^^offerings", "Straight^^students", "law"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 0.9242254495620728, "JobsEducation": 0.668318510055542, "Society": 1.0000066757202148}, "second_cat": {"Society_Other": 1.0000066757202148, "PoliticsGovernment_Municipal": 0.9242254495620728, "JobsEducation_Education": 0.668318510055542}, "third_cat": {"JobsEducation_Education_K12": 0.668318510055542}}}

I was often running up the corridor with a tampon up my sleeve for the 10th time in one day . Or I would lean strategically against the desk while teaching , in order to dampen the chronic pain . Experience : Why are n't we talking about menstrual flooding ? Opinion : Why is teaching still ` female-unfriendly ' ? All this was against the backdrop of trying to be the best teacher I could for my students . Often , I was far too embarrassed to tell my line manager about the next instalment in the saga of my failing reproductive system . But then came the relief : my specialist said it was time to move to IVF . The good news was that I qualified for three cycles of IVF on the NHS . Three : brilliant . IVF was straightforward . It was easy . It was a dead cert . When your fertility is no longer your own IVF becomes a very clear and definite part of your life before it even starts : your fertility no longer feels like it is yours alone . I was a deputy headteacher in a school where I 'd been working for five years . I discussed my fertility with my headteacher in a way that I would n't have if I had been trying to conceive naturally . The hospital appointments were neverending . I told numerous colleagues what I was doing , in order to explain so many missed lessons and meetings . IVF became a huge part of my life . It was there : present and real . It was something so present that it could n't possibly lead to nothing . Then it began : the weight gain , the hormones , the tears . Being pumped full of hormones to harvest 20 times more eggs than you should in one month -LRB- on half an ovary -RRB- is pretty tough . It was March , and the second round of Year 11 mocks had started . I felt like I was lopsided : the drag from my ovary was so strong as I marched around , collecting errant children and making sure everyone had the correct paper . Left with nothing Teaching is not a job where you can sit quietly in a corner with a hot-water bottle on your stomach . It is a job that is very difficult to do when your mind is in another place . Every twinge , every ache , every cramp pulls your mind away from the class in front of you . I lost count of the number of students who asked me if I was I OK during those days : far more than any adults . The teacher is every student 's focus , and it is hard to fake it when your mind and body no longer feel like your own . It sounds like I am moaning about this part of the process . But , in a lot of ways , these were the good days . I was doing something , I was `` getting pregnant '' . I had two lists of names on my phone : one for if it was a boy and one for if it was a girl . I had plotted when my maternity leave would fall , and was planning our wedding around it . I remember one of my Year 11s asking me if I wanted children , and I nearly told them that I was pregnant . I mean , I was partway through my first treatment . That was as good as being pregnant . My baby was on its way . Only it was n't . It was n't that first cycle . It was n't after the first frozen embryo transfer . It was n't after the second cycle . It was n't after the third cycle . And , it was n't after the second frozen embryo transfer . I was left with nothing . Well , not quite nothing . Running out of a classroom mid lesson , after feeling a flood of blood leaving my uterus , was not nothing . Collapsing in a lesson and having to go to hospital because of the crippling cramps after a failed cycle was not nothing . Crying , locked in the staff toilets , after a member of staff came to tell me they were pregnant was not nothing . Having to smile and tell everyone that it did n't work , but that it was fine , was not nothing . Like a bereavement Failed IVF is not treated like bereavement , but I can honestly say that it should be . I do n't think people generally understand how gruelling the process is . I did n't , and the hospital certainly did n't prepare me for it . Teaching is a demanding job -- it demands our physical wellbeing , our emotional wellbeing and our happiness -LRB- forced or otherwise -RRB- in a way no other job does . Our mood dictates the climate in our classroom , and our students deserve -- and need -- a positive and purposeful environment . When the line of a certain poem brings you so close to tears that you almost choke for the child you will never carry , you should n't be in the classroom . When a discussion about the theme of parent-child relationships in a play knocks the breath from your lungs , you should n't be in the classroom . When you have to go to the toilet every 40 minutes to change your underwear , because of the flood of menstrual blood after a failed IVF , you should n't be in the classroom . Accepting you will never carry your own child is something that takes a long time to get your head around . You grieve for the child that you will never carry . I was lucky : I had a headteacher who understood . I implore all of you , be the colleague , the line manager , the friend who understands , too .

Soon after returning from that war as a wounded and decorated veteran , Mr Kerry had concluded that it was a pointless misadventure . In Iowa he worried that America was again on the brink of another disastrous war -- this time with Iran . President Donald Trump had ordered the killing of General Qassem Suleimani , perhaps the second-most-powerful man in Iran , eviscerating what little remained of the detente that Mr Kerry and Mr Obama had worked to establish through diplomatic channels . `` We did n't sit there publicly pissing and moaning and screaming about how bad they were and tweeting away and creating a storm , '' Mr Kerry said . This , Mr Kerry argued , is the reason to trust in Mr Biden , who , between his time as a senator and vice-president , has nearly half a century of experience in matters of foreign policy . More years , in other words , than Pete Buttigieg -- another candidate vying to represent the moderate faction of the party -- has had on Earth . His long experience is why Mr Biden thinks that foreign-policy debates will help him . Unfortunately for him , the race has focused largely on domestic matters . Foreign affairs have been relegated to one-off speeches . None of the four leading candidates has published a specific China policy on their campaign websites , for instance . All mightily agree to disagree with Mr Trump 's impetuosity and self-imposed crises -- whether by launching trade wars , leaving the Paris climate accord or by alternately taunting and serenading Kim Jong Un of North Korea . General Suleimani 's death has changed that . On January 14th the candidates had their final debate before the Iowa caucuses , with foreign policy dominating . It revealed big differences beneath their superficial agreement . Of the major candidates , Mr Biden is most keen on restoring the pre-Trump status quo . Reassuring NATO allies , rejoining both the Paris accord and the Iran nuclear deal and pursuing arms-control treaties with Russia rank high among his priorities . He is the candidate most in line with the Washington foreign-policy establishment , often mocked as `` the blob '' . Critics to his left have suggested this is hardly a mark of good judgment . They point to Mr Biden 's vote to authorise the Iraq war in 2002 -- ressurecting the issue for the fourth primary season in two decades . But Mr Biden is not in the liberal interventionist tradition of Hillary Clinton . He disagreed stridently with the secretary of state over the decision in 2011 to intervene in Libya . Though he would like to `` end the forever wars in Afghanistan and the Middle East '' , he is open , unlike some of his opponents , to leaving residual forces in Afghanistan . He would also like to increase arms sales to Ukraine . Though voters may appreciate a return to the old ways , some breaks are more difficult to mend than others . The Paris accord would be simple to rejoin , but Iran might not be put back in the bag so easily . Great-power competition with China continues apace . Mr Trump 's norm-breaking around matters of trade -- such as imposing tariffs on stretched national-security grounds -- may embolden other countries to try the same tactics . Both Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren , the leading left-wing candidates , differ from the blob by framing foreign policy in the context of domestic projects . Mr Sanders sees international affairs in terms of a binary contest , between `` a growing worldwide movement towards authoritarianism , oligarchy and kleptocracy '' and his own egalitarian vision . For decades he has been a sharp critic of American interventions , particularly in Latin America . Ms Warren views corruption as the wellspring of all problems , both domestic and foreign . Her analysis of global disorder , published in Foreign Affairs , blames both `` endless wars '' and the export of `` a particular brand of capitalism , one that involved weak regulations , low taxes on the wealthy and policies favouring multinational corporations '' , for America 's diminished standing in the world . In her view , reducing inequality can enhance stability internationally as well as at home . Mr Sanders and Ms Warren are trying to overcome the somewhat artificial divide between foreign and domestic policy . This is sensible regarding competition with China -- where infrastructure , education , research funding and industrial policy may matter more to long-term outcomes than any reshuffling of aircraft-carriers . `` It is easy to draw the contrast with the current president , who has no obvious plans other than dragging us closer and closer to war in the Middle East , '' said Ms Warren , when asked about her vision of foreign affairs after an event in Mason City , Iowa . `` We need a State Department that is fully staffed up , we need to use our economic tools , and we need to work with our allies . '' Ms Warren 's published plan to rebuild the foreign service -- which Mr Trump seems to have damaged for years to come -- is thoughtful and detailed . She has hinted at an enthusiasm for using trade policy to extract concessions on issues such as the environment , labour standards and human rights . Both she and Mr Sanders may agree with Mr Trump in keeping tariffs on China , for instance , though for less haphazard and more principled reasons . The Democratic candidates may keep in lockstep in their denunciations of Mr Trump 's foreign policy , but the differences between them are significant . And if Congress remains divided , their plans for America 's relationship with the rest of the world are more likely to be implemented than their domestic agendas , which tend to receive more attention . Much foreign policy can be made by executive fiat . Overseas , adversaries and allies alike will find a change in the American presidency entails bumpier seesawing than ever before . `` As Congress has become more and more dysfunctional , the presidency has taken more and more power , '' says Daniel Drezner , a professor of international politics at Tufts University . `` If you combine consolidated executive power with polarisation , '' he adds , `` it leads to schizophrenic foreign policy .

That would require achieving these fundamental design goals : Immersive Audio -LRB- six ceiling channels -RRB- High Quality 4K Video Noise Isolation 7 Seats -LRB- Front Row of 3 to facilitate the `` sweet spot '' for music listening , and a rear row of four -RRB- Professionally engineered acoustic design 12-foot wide screen at 16:9 aspect ratio -LRB- with magnetic masking panels to 2:40 -RRB- Unique design aesthetic -LRB- i.e. no columns , no stage , lights to change `` look of room '' -RRB- 17 speakers and eight subwoofers IMAX-like experience from both rows 100 % satisfaction -LRB- difficult to achieve , but I 've achieved it -- there really are no what-ifs for me with this room -RRB- AVS Forum : What are some unique aspects or features of your home theater ? MB : This theater is 100 % disc-less and has one A/V source : the Nvidia Shield . I sold my game consoles , other streaming boxes , and Oppo UDP-203 once I verified that the Shield replaces all other A/V sources . My A/V rack looks pretty comical , as there are empty rack spaces where my source devices were once installed . Curved 16:9 screen . Part of the `` experience '' I was seeking involved a curved screen at the front of the room . But I also wanted a 16:9 screen which is essential for the `` IMAX-like '' experience . Some video experts I consulted with were not fans of the idea , but the end result is a truly immersive experience -- especially from the front row . It also looks really cool when everything is turned off . Ceiling clouds that contain the Atmos speakers and non-accent room lighting . I designed this solution in Excel and passed off to Jeff Parkinson who contributed SIGNIFICANTLY to this room build . He green-lit the feasibility and we took it from there . Lighting scheme . The first thing I noted was that I wanted to use lighting in an interesting way to change the feel of the room . That 's why I chose gray panels -- I wanted the light to define the look and feel of the room . The strip lights are installed such a way that they make the room appear deeper from the seating positions , with the panels getting progressively larger the further back into the room you go . This took a bit of math to get just right , but it works quite nicely ! For listening , the wall and ceiling accent lights default to a soft , soothing white ; for listening to modern or pop music , the lighting is violet and pulsates synchronized to the beat being played ; for movie previews , the lights default to a a dim blue ; for TV , the room defaults to a moderately bright red . For viewing , these lighting schemes are active until I hit a button on my Harmony Elite remote to turn them off . I only leave them on if I 'm just listening to my high-resolution music collection . The QSC Q-sys equalization stack . This has provided so much flexibility in calibration , I ca n't imagine the room without it . Using the Qsys Designer software and Room Equalization Wizard , I can create custom-curves in real-time -- especially helpful for tailoring the bass from eight subwoofers . The result is evenly distributed and powerful bass in each of the seven seats . The overall soundstage is also very , very cohesive . Massive curved steps . My original SketchUp design involved large angled straight steps , but that concept soon switched to large curved steps for a sleeker aesthetic aspect . Although a minor detail , these are actually one of my favorite things of the theater . The way the accent lighting and step-lights work together to illuminate the curved design always brings a smile to my face . The fact that the entire build process was recorded in a 17-episode YouTube video series entitled `` The Beast , Unleashed . '' AVS Forum : How long was the planning phase ? MB : The planning phase lasted for about six months and was executed entirely on The Beast , Unleashed AVS Forum build thread . AVS Forum : How long was the building phase ? MB : The building phase lasted for about 2.5 years because most work took place on Sundays and we refused to use any credit cards on the theater , which meant having to have the cash for everything This is not easy as a newlywed whose wife has other ideas about how money should be spent . A word of advice : never use credit cards to fund a hobby . That 's a one-way ticket to a lifetime of debt because the passion inherent to hobbies -- especially this one -- usually defies logic when it comes to spending . Plus , the demands of being a husband with a growing family which caused work to cease for months at a time . If we had worked this straight through every Sunday with no breaks , I 'd say this was about a solid year and a half 's worth of work . AVS Forum : What construction materials and techniques did you use ? MB : During the process , I : Utilized THREE layers of 5/8 '' drywall with green glue in between the sheets . The triple drywall was hung on clips and channel , and the stud walls are secured to joists using IB-3 clips . Drywall is caulked at seams on first layer and heavily caulked at the bottom around the perimeter of the room . I am so very happy with how the efforts of noise isolation have paid off . The room is such a bunker , the wife and I often do n't even bother closing the door before watching a movie ... . and we watch movies once our infant and toddler are sleeping . The children remain undisturbed , and when it 's just me , the wife remains undisturbed as well . The riser has speaker cable run to every single seat , in case I decide to go on the extreme end and install small subwoofers under each seat . The room has three doors -- one to a separate -LRB- and also soundproofed -RRB- 9 ' x 10 ' equipment room , one to the mechanicals room directly behind the theater , and the entry/exit doorway . Double-door airlock with Zero door seals and automatic door-bottoms are utilized for the mechanicals room and entry/exit doorways , and the results are overwhelmingly positive . My Furnace and Water Heater blower both operate at full force without so much as a peep audible within the theater , despite it being 30 '' from the rear theater wall . The equipment room uses weather stripping to prevent fan-noise from entering the theater , which is needed . Thanks to the separate soundproofed equipment room , I have all my fans running at full speed to ensure proper cooling of equipment . I would have had to select a completely different equipment setup if the gear was not located separately from the theater . I utilized a material from Amazon called `` Kno Knoise '' and placed it on the ductwork that could not be relocated . This , plus the triple drywall/clips channel on the soffit , eliminates the sound of air moving through the ducts as it travels to elsewhere in the basement . I also ran seven dedicated 20 Amp circuits to the equipment room . Currently , each power amplifier has its own dedicated electrical circuit . This was done to maximize available power to the amplifiers . AVS Forum : What was the total cost ? MB : The MSRP on the room as it stands today is $ 158,000 ; however , thanks to great relationships that I 've built with numerous dealers while configuring my previous theater , the `` actual '' cost of this theater , including labor and materials , was around $ 120,000 . That 's right -- great dealer relationships saved me nearly $ 40k in equipment costs . AVS Forum : How much was true DIY -LRB- with your own hands and those of friends and family -RRB- and how much was contracted out ? MB : I 'd say the room was about 60 % DIY and 40 % contracted labor . AVS Forum : If you contracted some of the work out , who or what company was the designer , installer , etc. ? Who did the acoustic design , audio/video calibration ? MB : Nyal Mellor of Acoustic Frontiers did the acoustic design of the room . Jeff Parkinson -LRB- @BigmouthinDC -RRB- was the contractor I worked with at the preparation , framing , electrical and interior details stages . He had to teach me so much -- my wife and I joke that I 'm the reason he 's now retired from theater building . Nothing about this build was easy . To put things in perspective , it took ~ 3 months before framing could take place . All this time was spent just preparing the room for framing -- there were just so many little things that had to be moved , fixed , or closed up before framing could occur . Custom Colors , Inc. based in MD did the drywall installation work . They were previously experienced in triple drywall from building a commercial cinema in the area , as well as at least one AVS Forum member 's double-dry walled theater , and they worked very quickly . The job took them a day and a half to cover every nook and cranny in three layers of drywall . AVS Forum : What were your biggest challenges ? How did you meet them ? MB : The original room size was 18 ' x 18 ' -- ordered a design and decided I was not willing to accept the compromises of a perfectly square room . I decided to roll in another basement room into the theater and roll another basement room into duty as a dedicated equipment room directly connected to the theater . The challenge : the Water Heater , Furnace , and a full bathroom needed to move . I demolished the bathroom -LRB- rebuilt it elsewhere in the basement -RRB- and I had a HVAC/Plumbing service move the water heater and furnace to an area that would fall directly behind the theater space . Another challenge was turning a sump closet into the cinema entryway . I had the sump pump moved about 6 feet to the right , and had a structural engineer come in and draw up plans for widening the doorway -LRB- necessary because it was a structural wall holding up stairs and landing on the first floor -RRB- . We took a 22 '' load-bearing sump closet entry way and made it a 32 '' entryway . AVS Forum : What were the greatest moments in the process ? MB : There were a few great moments . They are : A Home Theater Get-Together we hosted in November of 2018 . There were about 23 attendees spread across two days and three sessions . It was a glorious experience to share the fruits of all the hard work and time spent with others who share the same passion ! It may have been just another G2G to many attendees , but for me -- it was one of the most memorable moments in my life . A fabric-wrapping party , where @dougusmc and @redstripe77 helped me wrap my fabric frames with some Guilford of Maine acoustically transparent fabric . So much fun was had just chatting and learning . Firing up the Triad Platinum LCRs for the first time for some stereo audiophile listening while the room was mid-construction . With debris everywhere , fiberglass particles still floating in the air , I sat down on the not-yet-carpeted stage , and pressed play . This project was quite a financial burden spread across nearly 3 years , and I strongly considered cutting my losses , canceling the project , and investing my money elsewhere . But ... when I pressed play for the first time , sitting on a dusty wood riser in the middle of a construction zone , and closed my eyes , I was transported to a world where the theater was complete , and this helped motivate me to keep going . Seeing an image on the 12ft-wide 16:9 screen for the first time . My projector was slated for delivery the day after my first child was born . While my wife and new baby were sleeping , I left the hospital and rushed home to be there for the delivery window so I could sign for the projector -LRB- the wife and I had planned for this that morning -RRB- . I received it , mounted it while running on fumes from being awake for 3 days straight and turned it on . Once that first picture loaded -LRB- The Oppo UDP-203 Home Screen -RRB- I just stared at it , thinking `` this was so worth it ! '' I quickly played some visual test material but was unable to focus from being so tired . So , I turned it off and rushed back to the hospital to continue spending time with my wife and newborn baby . Experiencing Dolby Atmos -- the first scene I played was the Klingon battle from Star Trek : Into Darkness . I immediately called my wife down , and she was floored that this was possible in a residential cinema . All this awesomeness does not come cheap , here 's the full breakdown of gear and prices :", "url": "https://www.avsforum.com/home-theater-month-beast-unleashed/", "kws": ["Theater", "theater^^building", "amazing^^sound", "movie^^previews", "powerful^^bass", "Immersive^^Audio", "movies", "TV", "Star^^Trek", "Dolby^^Atmos", "incredible^^attention", "Room^^Equalization^^Wizard", "non-accent^^room^^lighting", "Front^^Row", "Home", "pure^^AVS^^Forum", "Double-door^^airlock", "true^^DIY", "lights", "Acoustic^^Frontiers"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 0.5200470089912415}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Other": 0.5200470089912415}}}

1.0	{"docid": "0NrcBizO", "title": "Queer Underworld : VAMPYROS LESBOS -LRB- 1971 -RRB-", "content": "Vampyros Lesbos is a German exploitation film that is relatively unremembered save for its psychedelic score that would find a resurgence in popularity during the 1990s , but at the time of its release it was a popular staple of European cinemas for pretty much exactly the reason you would expect : Vampyros Lesbos is basically the softest of softcore pornography , but with the added hook that all the sex portrayed onscreen is between two women . It would be generous to consider its plot convoluted , since it exists primarily to get our innocent protagonist and vampiric antagonist simultaneously naked again and again , but it 's also such a thinly sketched film that you 'd be forgiven for losing track of characters , motivations , or even whether someone is or is not in the thrall of the vampire 's curse , as ambiguously defined as that is . This is clearly a film made by heterosexual men , for heterosexual men , with the express purpose of titillation . But that does n't mean the film is without value to the kind of women the film exploits for that titillation . The plot , for what its , focuses on a legal worker named Linda Westinghouse -LRB- Ewa Str\u00f6mberg -RRB- who visits a nightclub burlesque act , performed by the Countess Nadine Carody -LRB- Soledad Miranda -RRB- . Linda 's boyfriend Omar -LRB- Andr\u00e9s Monales -RRB- notices how enraptured she is with the performance , though he clearly does n't understand her attraction to the spectacle . Linda then starts having dreams of this mysterious dancer , who calls her to her island home . Linda seeks out the countess under the pretense of settling estate issues , but along the way meets a mysterious man named Memmet -LRB- Jes\u00fas Franco , also director and co-writer of the film -RRB- , who warns her to stay away from the island . However , when she discovers Memmet torturing a woman in his basement , she flees to the island anyway . What follows is a pretty standard story of vampiric seduction as Nadine discovers that she is addicted to Linda 's blood , and Linda finds herself unsuccessfully resisting Nadine 's thrall with no memory of their sexual encounters after they happen . What 's more interesting from a thematic standpoint are the subplots , revolving around an institutionalized woman named Agra -LRB- Heidrun Kussin -RRB- , her caretaker Dr. Seward -LRB- Dennis Price -RRB- , and the aforementioned Memmet . Agra has persistent dreams and fantasies about a mistress calling out to her , which Dr. Seward purports to treat as delusions . However , as Dr. Seward wakes an unconscious Linda who newly arrived in his care , it becomes clear that he does n't really think the hypnotic influence of this mistress is fake . In fact , he tells Linda how to kill a vampire , taking their existence as fact . An eventual confrontation between Nadine and the doctor reveals that he wishes to hold the same kind of vampiric sway over people , which I think says something about how the people making this film see lesbians . Namely , within the unconscious subtext of this film , lesbianism is seen as a threat to heterosexual masculinity . It 's something that straight men are drawn to as a sexual attraction , and it 's something that may even be exploited for male titillation , but it 's ultimately a threat to their perceived ability to attract women . After all , why should a woman be with a man when she 's clearly enjoying herself so much with another woman ? You see this play out in Dr. Seward 's envy of Nadine 's power , but you also see it in Memmet 's abduction and torture of women he believes to have been brought under Nadine 's influence . Memmet eventually captures Linda and reveals that Agra is his wife , though you would never know it from how Agra obsesses over her mistress . Memmet seems to believe that he is saving these enthralled women from his wife 's fate . The director 's choice to cast himself in this role feels telling , for even though Memmet is an obvious villain , he gives voice to a perspective that underlies the film 's blatant sexual purpose : lesbians may be exciting , but they are a threat to masculinity . This theme is reinforced when Linda comes upon a weakened , blood-deprived Nadine , and rather than give her blood willingly , she instead bites Nadine 's neck before killing her with a sharpened pole through the eye . The intentional reading of this scene is that Linda overcame her unholy sexual desires to slay her temptress , returning to the arms of her boyfriend , but I want to take a step back and look at this film through a queerer lens . Remember that in 1970 there were very few films that depicted lesbianism in any fashion , exploitatively or not . Simply acknowledging the existence of same-sex relationships in a film was novel , and though the film subtextually reinforces the patriarchal heterosexual status quo , its text is purely a sensual exploration of lesbian sexuality . It may be offered under the barest pretext of elevated pornography , but it 's still a story of sexual awakening and desire , albeit through a lens of fantastical horror and male gaze . This is , admittedly , a pretty shallow justification for considering the film in any way sexually progressive . But the thing to remember about sexual awakening , both for straight and queer folks , is that it is often spurned on by exposure to eroticism and often pornography . Sexuality between two women may be in films for marketability and reinforcement of straight male consumption , but women are still exposed to that sensuality and potentially have something to gain or discover in themselves from that exposure . It 's through exploitation and pornography that many queer folks even realize that they are n't straight or cisgender , through finding something erotic in an eroticism not explicitly targeted at them . I wanted to talk about Vampyros Lesbos , not because it 's a particularly important film in the cinematic canon or even because it 's a particularly good film , but because it really is neither . It 's a sleazy little film that had a moment of popularity , and even though it is founded on a basis of exploitation , it still holds value as an artifact of its era . While straight men may have left the theater aroused and reaffirmed that their own girlfriends were safe from lesbian seduction , lesbians might have found a kernel of truth in the moment where Nadine kills Dr. Seward for his arrogance , or in the film 's final moments , where Linda , against Omar 's wishes , refuses to forget her encounters with Nadine . Vampyros Lesbos is worth talking about because , even though it was n't made with a queer audience in mind , it still had something to say to an audience starved for content , and even amongst the false equivalency of lesbianism with monstrosity , there 's still an affirmation of existence , the reality of lesbian desire . It may not be much , and it would certainly be pitiful by today 's standards , but that affirmation still holds value .", "url": "https://birthmoviesdeath.com/2020/01/16/queer-underworld-vampyros-lesbos-1971", "kws": ["Vampyros^^Lesbos", "LESBOS", "Underworld", "fantastical^^horror", "lesbian^^seduction", "films", "vampiric^^seduction", "depicted^^lesbianism", "male^^titillation", "vampiric^^antagonist", "heterosexual^^masculinity", "lesbian^^sexuality", "sexual^^awakening", "unholy^^sexual^^desires", "motivations", "heterosexual^^men", "truth", "lesbian^^desire", "burlesque", "existence"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 1.0000091791152954}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Movies": 1.0000091791152954}}}
0.0	{"docid": "0NrcH6Vt", "title": "Pro Tips for Duck Hunting 's Toughest Challenges", "content": "If you 've hunted ducks and geese much , you know how this goes : You try a setup , but it does n't work . You rearrange the spread . That does n't work either . You try a different setup . Same story . You keep asking yourself , `` What am I doing wrong ? '' Sometimes you ca n't figure it out . But the experts can help . I recently posed several challenging scenarios to dedicated waterfowlers across the country to see how they would handle those problems . Their answers can make your hunting outings less stressful and more successful . Finicky Late-Season Geese Hunter : Travis Mueller , regional sales manager at Banded Brands , Iowa The Problem : There 's a week left in the season , and the Canadas are concentrated in a riffle on a small river . Do you hunt it and risk a one-shot deal ? They never seem to feed in the same field twice . Mueller 's Solution : Chances are those birds are loafing on the small river and roosting on much larger open water , so I 'd hunt the riffle . Depending on the weather , you 'll likely have traffic throughout the day , so you can get creative with your setup , including using sleeper shells , floaters , full-bodies and flagging . If the birds relocate , they 'll likely just move up or down the river , and you should be able to hunt them the rest of the season . Pro Tip : Only shoot at smaller bunches of returning birds , if you can help it . Also , do n't overhunt this spot . Rest it between shoots . Ice Issues Hunter : Tony Vandemore , co-owner of Habitat Flats , Missouri The Problem : It 's a sunny day , and you break a hole in the ice and put out a great-looking duck and goose spread , but birds keep flaring . Vandemore 's Solution : If birds are flaring with perfect conditions over an ice hole , it 's probably an issue with my hide . That 's what I 'm going to address first . When birds circle but wo n't finish , sliding the edges of the decoys , I believe it 's a decoy issue . Also , I 'd look at the ice that was broken out of the hole . Did you slide it under the existing ice or just push it up on top ? If you pushed it on top , it can glare like crazy . Always try to push the ice you 're removing under the remaining ice to combat this . Pro Tip : When I hunt an ice hole , I mostly use sleeper Canada shells for ducks and geese . On-the-water motion , such as a jerk cord , is also vitally important . Shots at Geese Hunter : Dan Compton , product line manager at Federal Ammunition , Minnesota The Problem : You have no problems decoying Canadas but ca n't knock them down . You 're shooting 3.5-inch steel BBBs at 20 to 30 yards . Compton 's Solution : Have you patterned your shotgun ? Larger pellets often create tighter patterns . At that distance , you might have to be right on the bird with little forgiveness to ensure a hit . Patterning the gun will let you know how wide the shot is hitting at that range , how dense the pattern is , and where you should aim at the bird -- high , low or right on . A 3.5-inch 12-gauge BBB would be considered a long-range load and might be overkill for decoying Canadas . I would try Black Cloud 11/4-ounce 3-inch BB or No. 1 shot and save the 3.5-inch loads of larger shot for days when birds are not finishing and you have to reach a little farther . Pro Tip : I 'm a huge fan of pattern density and high pellet count , meaning smaller pellets . Within reason , that is . If birds are finishing at 20 yards and I practice self-discipline , I 'll go as small as No. 2 or even 3 shot and concentrate on that vulnerable head-and-neck region . Frozen Gun Hunter : Travis Madden , Avery Outdoors/Banded pro , Utah The Problem : Subzero temperatures lock your shotgun during a January hunt . Madden 's Solution : Nobody wants a gun to malfunction , especially during a barnburner . To ensure that does n't happen , start with preventative maintenance at home . Clean your gun regularly . Oil tends to collect dust and dirt and can thicken , especially in cold weather . I prefer a silicone-based lubricant , as it will dry and not collect dust and dirt . I also carry a small can of lubricant in my blind bag . If my shotgun locks up , I can disassemble it in the field and apply the lubricant . Pro Tip : When I lived in Iowa , we 'd hunt geese in temperatures well below zero . Sometimes , nothing worked . However , if I know it will be that cold , I 'll strip my shotgun internally with brake/carburetor cleaner to get rid of any gummy lube and then lightly spray the moving parts with a Teflon - or graphite-based dry spray . Also , carry a small bottle of automotive lock de-icer in your blind bag . One spritz usually gets parts moving again . Spinning Out Hunter : Terry Denmon , president and CEO of Mojo Outdoors , Louisiana The Problem : During cloudy days , your spinner flares birds a bit . Denmon 's Solution : If it 's cloudy and ducks are n't finishing , I would first attempt to determine the cause of the problem , understanding that it 's often the result of multiple factors , some of which you can not control . If I believe it 's spinning wings on a cloudy day , I would first swap the wings for a set of Mojo Cloudy Day Wings . If ducks approach to within a certain number of yards of the decoys but no closer , move the spinner at least that same distance from the hole . I would not eliminate it , as you 'll give up your long-range attraction . I would always keep one spinner for long-range attraction , even if it 's 100 yards from the spread . Pro Tip : I 'd add other devices , such as the Flock-A-Flickers , to maintain the attraction concept , only in a more realistic presentation . Last , I 'd recognize that some days , you might not decoy ducks because of various factors , some of which -- again -- might be outside of your control . Land-Shy Bills Hunter : Brad Bortner , retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist , Washington The Problem : A lake holds plenty of bluebills , but they 're landing outside your spread and shore blind . Bortner 's Solution : It 's always better to hunt waterfowl where they want to be . That 's a much better bet than trying to get them to come to you . If bluebills use the area in front of your blind when you are n't hunting but wo n't commit when you 're there , figure out why . Try moving the decoys to one side , or split them to both sides to give ducks a place to land . Try moving the spread closer . Maybe add some motion . If you can get on the lake , look at the blind to see if something 's out of place . Divers typically fly low over the water , so try to identify any glare that keeps them from seeing your spread . Pro Tip : Stand back and really examine your setup with a critical eye . Something 's out of place . Also , watch how the next group of birds works the decoys . And the next . Identify a pattern to discover what you should fix . Fly the Flag ? Hunter : Shane Moon , owner of North Flight Waterfowl , Washington The Problem : Your goose flag seems to have a negative effect , making 90 percent of the flocks turn . Moon 's Solution : If the flag 's not working or it 's flaring birds , it might be too shiny . Or maybe you 're using it when birds are too close . Hit the birds on the corners or while they 're at a distance . Every tool has its time and place , so change when and how you use it . If your flapping technique does n't work , flag more aggressively , or be more subtle with it -- just a flick now and again to keep birds coming and on line . Above all , make it look real . Pro Tip : Still not working ? Put it away . Wrong-Way Decoys Hunter : Mike Callian , calling champion and guide at Big Guns Outfitters , Washington The Problem : Geography requires you to set up with the wind in your face . Callian 's Solution : In a head-on wind situation , I typically push my decoy spread out another 10 to 20 yards and put the hole right in front . Flip it so it faces your blind . This will feel uncomfortable at first , but if you time your calling and motion with a jerk cord right , birds should work directly over your back and finish between you and the decoys . Make sure you 're hidden well , as the birds will pick apart the cover as they approach from behind . Pro Tip : Sometimes , you must play the cards you 're dealt . I hunt a place where that happens often . I cover up extremely well and let birds work from behind as they come from the bay . I crowd the opposite side of the shallow sheet water puddle -- about 50 yards away -- with duck and Canada floaters and try to force birds to land between the spread and my hide . Need the Bead ? Hunter : Rafe Nielsen , director of marketing and communications at Browning , Utah The Problem : You love the looks of the front fiber-optic bead on your new shotgun , but your shooting seems to have suffered Nielsen 's Solution : Do n't panic . Whenever you change anything on a gun , it takes time to adjust to the new look or feel . Spend a few minutes at the range . Get used to the new look . Pattern the gun again to make sure the new sight has n't changed your point of impact . If the gun is patterning correctly but you still ca n't hit birds like you used to after a few rounds of clays , get rid of the sight . Not all accessories help . Pro Tip : A friend was in a slump after buying a new shotgun .

Vasectomy is done by cutting or blocking two tubes , called the vas deferens , so that sperm ca n't get into the semen . Sometimes , due to a change in life circumstance , men decide they want to be able to father another child . Vasectomy reversal is a procedure to reconnect the vas deferens and return the ability to impregnate a partner . Pregnancy rates after vasectomy reversal will range from about 30 % to over 90 % , depending on the type of procedure . Many factors affect whether a reversal successfully achieves pregnancy , including time since a vasectomy , partner age , surgeon experience and training , and whether there were fertility issues before a vasectomy . On the next Mayo Clinic Radio program , Dr. Sevann Helo , a Mayo Clinic urologist , will discuss vasectomy reversal and male infertility . Also on the program , Dr. Dale Ekbom , a Mayo Clinic otolaryngologist and head and neck surgeon , will explain treatment options for vocal cord paralysis .

Because the township board meeting room was still under renovations , those coming to the public hearing were packed into the Otisville-Sheldon room . The meeting was not recorded for cable or You Tube viewing and there were no microphones provided to the board or audience , so there was difficulty in hearing the comments . At issue is special land use for the 64,000-square-foot Hampton Manor development , in two sections , proposed for the southeast corner of Tyler and Morton Taylor roads . It is planned to have 80 units : 24 in memory care and 36 in assisted living . The six parcels totaling 7.11 acres are presently owned by Walter and Evelyn Joyce Rochowiak , who live across Tyler Road from the site . The Rochowiaks had the property rezoned C -LRB- Local Business -RRB- District in 1999 when they said they were going to have to move their Garden Fantasy greenhouses and florist shop to the site because their landlord would be moving them out . The Tyler/Morton Taylor site had been previously owned by Bentley Nurseries who had one acre of it already zoned C . The Bentleys also rezoned the rest of the property from Agriculture to residential , with plans to break it into lots to build houses in the future . But , in 1993 the Rochowiaks purchased the property and in 1998 asked to have all the property rezoned C . The Rochowiaks did n't leave the Haggerty Road site until a few years ago and at that time they moved their business to their farm and the site under discussion remained vacant . Walden Woods at the northwest corner of Tyler and Morton Taylor was built with a strip of commercial zoning along Tyler Road , but that zoning would expire when the PUD agreement ran out . The Rochowiak site zoned C now is completely surrounded by residential properties . Charter Club Estates subdivision residents , across Morton Taylor road from the site , fought the rezoning in 1998 and 1999 and many of the same Charter Club residents are opposing this development now . The proposed developer is listed in township documents as Van Buren Investors Land Holdings LLC , which opponents have pointed out is not registered with the state . In his information to the township , developer Zohaib Syed listed his address as 1451 S. Gratiot , Clinton Township , which is the site of an auto repair shop . But Sam Martin , vice president of development of Hampton Manor , said their Hampton Manors are in operation and ready for inspections in Shelby Township , Brighton , Dundee , and one under construction on Ridge Road in Canton Township . He said they would like the local seniors to be able to stay in VBT . `` My partner and I got into this years ago , '' Martin said . `` We want to make sure they 're happy . We have free valet services to go get the car for seniors when weather is bad . '' He said traffic will be minimal since usually only 1 % of the seniors are driving . The shifts for the 15 employees will be 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. , 3 to 11 p.m. , and 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. Martin said the development will offer beauty salons , spas , movie theatres , courtyards , grilles , sunrooms , libraries , and outside doors for each assisted living unit . Thirteen people stood up to speak in the audience , with most against the project and a few just asking questions . Attorney Tom DiPietro , who has lived on Morton Taylor Road for many years , said years ago he was concerned about the apartments when they were planned and they were built and he got used to it . Then he was concerned about the new subdivisions , and he got a whole lot of new neighbors . `` It 's hard to place our parents , '' DiPietro said . `` This is a nice one ... a low-level use with minimal impact . '' Attorney Lisa Martin , who lives across Morton Taylor Road in Charter Club subdivision , spoke against the siting of the assisted living project . She said the ordinance reads that projects must be compatible with the surrounding neighbors and this is n't , because it 's in a residential neighborhood . Also , Martin said Tyler Road is a main school bus route and the shift change at 3 p.m. is the time buses are running on Tyler . `` I hear tire screeches all the time , '' Martin said of the Morton Taylor/Tyler intersection that is a four-way stop . She noted that six other subdivisions are close and the Southeastern Michigan Council of Governments -LRB- SEMCOG -RRB- reports daily traffic of 4,300 to 4,400 cars within a quarter mile of that intersection . Martin said the zoning ordinance limits construction at that site to 30,000 square feet and this 62,000-64 ,000 - square-foot development is too big . She also questioned whether they will be able to smoke on campus and whether they will be throwing their cigarette butts into her neighborhood . The threat has been that something worse will come if we do n't build this , she said . She urged the planners to reject this plan . She said more traffic is not what they need , not at that corner . As she completed her remarks , the room erupted in applause . Karianne Butler of Charter Club asked about the monthly rent of the units and why Van Buren Investors Land Holdings LLC is not registered with the state . She asked about sidewalks and was told they would be along Tyler and Morton Taylor roads . She also asked about how they could only claim one vendor truck would deliver each week , if they had arrangements for ambulances , if they provide a smoking area , if there would be tax abatements , and how far this will be from Tyler Elementary School . A resident at 10890 Morton Taylor said her yard is like a lake when it rains . She said after Camping World spread out the gravel , it pushed more water into her yard . She wanted to know if the assisted living development would make it worse . Another Morton Taylor Road resident said drivers treat the four-way stop at Morton Taylor and Tyler more like a suggestion and there would be problems for drivers from out of town going to Hampton Manor . Dan Power , the township 's new director of planning , stood to say there is a nationwide movement to make a place for seniors to age in place . He said communities have to zone appropriately and the sites should be considered more as special land use . Planning consultant Vidya Krishnan of McKenna said the buildings total 62,516 square feet , are 17 feet tall , single story . The property has been zoned C at least for a decade , she said . The applicant is seeking special land use . When a woman asked about the 30,000-square-foot limit in the ordinance , Krishnan said they did n't want big box stores but senior housing is residential use in C zoning and that 's different . She said the special land use approval is there to give the township control over the development and the applicant is not seeking exceptions . Krishnan said the questions about flooding will be turned over to the engineers . She said Tyler and Morton Taylor are designated by the county as major thoroughfares . The group daycare homes along Tyler are run by the state . The questions about the safety of children crossing at Tyler School , the township will take up with the county . She said the ordinance requires 36 parking spaces for this development and 50 are being provided . Paul Kammer , an engineer with Fishbeck , said the developer has to contain the water on the site and the applicant has begun talking with the county on storm water management . Planning Commission chairwoman Carol Thompson asked Director Matthew Best what items he had on his list to check on . Director Best said : tax abatement is one item and he does n't think there will be a request for a tax abatement . Also , on his list is ambulance data from VBT and HVA . And , addresses of current locations of other Hampton Manors . He said they have no affiliations with any other homes in the community . Also , the lighting at the site will be downward facing and will not spread into adjoining lots . Best also said a serious construction bond is required for completion , so the township can complete the project if they walk away . Also , the planning commission would have to vote to allow the extra parking . And , the township has a priority on trash and cigarette butts . Developer Martin said , `` We try at making everything very homelike . Employees will take cigarette breaks in their cars and dispose of the cigarettes there . On the way back to the building they 'll pick up pieces of trash and pull a weed . '' He said the air conditioners will make minimal sound and the generator is tested once a week . He said the cost is private pay and they are looking at Medicaid . They take long-term insurance and veterans ' insurance . He also said the emergency vehicles do not turn on the sirens on the way to the facility so there will be no noise from that . A retired fireman in the back of the room called out to say that was not true . He said the sirens are turned on and Martin said they are not . The retired fireman said he had 15 more years of experience than Martin and he knows what happens . Belleville Fire Chief Brian Loranger , who lives in VBT , said a fire truck has to have a siren and light on the way to the location . Later Chief Loranger said the fire department would get in trouble if it did n't have lights and sirens on on the way to heart attacks and strokes . Martin invited people to tour their locations and said he would get the addresses for them . As to why the LLC is n't registered with the state , Martin said they have different LLCs for each location for tax purposes . At this point chairwoman Thompson ended the public hearing and said the commission will not proceed with the rest of the agenda -- approval of the special land use -LRB- which would then be sent on to the township board -RRB- and approval of the preliminary site plan . Motions were made and passed to close the public hearing , to postpone additional discussion , and to adjourn the meeting . Director Best said the applicant , Power , Krishnan , and himself will be stationed around the room to answer questions for a time following the meeting . Power said there were 17 emails received on this issue and they have been distributed to the commission members and also were being passed around the meeting room so , `` People know they 're being heard . '' In a memo to the commission from Power and Krishnan on Jan. 7 , the day before the meeting , the size of the proposed building was questioned , but this was not mentioned at the public hearing . The memo reads : `` The Township adopted a zoning ordinance amendment to allow for Senior Housing within the Township a few months ago . Senior housing has been a recent use that many communities are making provisions for . In some , senior housing is allowable in single family residential districts ; however , in Van Buren , the Township decided that senior housing would be held to a higher standard than a single-family residential use , therefore , the use was permitted in the C , C-1 , C-2 , MU , RM and RMH Districts . `` Senior Housing is permitted only as a special land use in all of the districts noted above , to allow the Township to have greater say in mitigating any potential adverse impacts from such use . The size of the development is determined by the specific design standards for the landscaping , buffering , screening , tree replacement , storm-water detention , etc. . The C district however has a limitation on the maximum building size for a single use . The intent behind this limitation was to restrict the traffic generated from any single commercial use . This standard was not intended for residential type uses in the commercial district . The C district currently allows for sit down restaurants , strip commercial buildings , professional medical and dental offices by right . These uses typically occupy a smaller footprint building but generate a significant amount of traffic and road trips . Senior housing is considered to be a lower intensity use than those allowable in the C district , since the traffic generated by such use is significantly less . `` When the Senior Housing ordinance was adopted , the intent was to have stringent site design standards that would ensure a development that would alleviate any negative impacts . The conflict with an existing ordinance provision was unexpected . We believe the existing C district restriction serves the community well with regard to commercial uses and the intensity they bring ; however , it is not an appropriate application for a use that is residential in nature . `` Section 3 of the original amendment presented before the PC and Board of Trustees states ` All other provisions of the Zoning Ordinance , or Ordinances or parts of Ordinances , in conflict with this Ordinance are hereby repealed only to the extent necessary to give this Ordinance full force and effect . ' While this section can be used , we believe the correct approach would be to amend the Senior Housing ordinance to provide clarification regarding the building size being governed by site designs standards and not the underlying district .

They are about strangers in another land -- people who have inadvertently been stranded far from home . The shows are `` Come From Away , '' which recently had a run in Philly and `` The Band 's Visit , '' which is running now through January 19 at the Academy of Music -LRB- Broad and Locust streets , Philadelphia , 215-731-3333 , www.kimmelcenter.org -RRB- . `` Come From Away '' is set in Newfoundland , Canada and features a relatively homogeneous group of characters -- North Americans who were stranded in the Maritime province when flights were rerouted during the 911 crisis . `` The Band 's Visit '' is set in a `` mythical '' Israeli town and features two very diverse groups of characters -- local Jewish townspeople and an Egyptian Police Band that ended up there by mistake . It 's a story of Jews and Arabs getting `` up close and personal . '' `` The Band 's Visit '' is a stage musical with music and lyrics by David Yazbek and a book by Itamar Moses , based on the 2007 Israeli film of the same name . The musical opened on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in November 2017 , after its off-Broadway premiere at the Atlantic Theater Company in December 2016 . The Off-Broadway production of `` The Band 's Visit '' won several major awards , including the 2017 Obie Award for Musical Theatre , as well the year 's New York Drama Critics ' Circle Award for Best Musical . At the 72nd Tony Awards , the show was nominated for 11 awards and won 10 -- including Best Musical . `` The Band 's Visit '' is one of four musicals in Broadway history to win the unofficial `` Big Six '' Tony Awards , which include Best Musical , Best Book , Best Score , Best Actor in a Musical , Best Actress in a Musical , and Best Direction of a Musical . It also won the 2019 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album . The play takes place over the course of one evening in the tiny desert town of Bet Hatikva , Israel . The Egyptian Police Band was actually bound for the similarly named town of Petah Tikvah . The Egyptian Police Band arrives in Israel to play a concert . After a mix-up at the border , it is sent to a remote village in the middle of the desert . With no bus until morning and no hotel in sight , the unfortunate travelers are taken in by the locals . Under the spell of the desert sky , their lives become intertwined in the most unexpected ways . The cast of the National Tour features Sasson Gabai as Tewfiq Zakaria , Chilina Kennedy as Dina , Pomme Koch as Itzik , Adam Gabai as Papi , Or Schraiber as Zelger and Marc Ginsburg as Sammy . Ginsburg is an area native who graduated from Bensalem High . `` I did n't know much about the show other than I had heard a lot about ot and listened to the original soundtrack , '' said Ginsburg , during a recent phone interview . `` When I heard that I had an audition , I watched the movie . I auditioned initially in February 2019 . I 'm based in L.A. I had a relationship with Rubin Casting and they thought I 'd be a decent fit . `` They asked me for a video audition . They sent me a scene and a song . I did n't hear anything for about a month and then they called e to come to New York . `` I worked with a friend who helped me with the Israeli language . And I also worked with a vocal coach . I auditioned in New York and got a call two days later . That was in late March and rehearsals started in mid-May . `` Now , I 'm on the road with the tour . I have a wife and a three-and-a-half-year-old son and we live in Encino -LRB- CA -RRB- . I did n't want to leave them there , so they came with me on the tour . '' Bet Hatikva is a rural town where the residents bemoan the boring and monotonous lives they lead in the desert . It has no hotel , one caf\u00e9 and one pay phone . The arrival of a band from Egypt is the most exciting thing that has happened there in years . Dina , the caf\u00e9 owner , tells the group that the next bus does not arrive until the next day . Dina offers the band a meal and a place to stay for the night , and Colonel Tewfiq , the band 's leader , reluctantly agrees . In her kitchen , Tewfiq asks her about her background , and she tells how she was once married , and nothing in real life went as she had idealistically and naively thought . She asks Tewfiq the same , and he tells of a wife and son in Egypt . `` What draws me to this show and still keeps me passionate about it is the simplicity of it , '' said Ginsburg . `` There is something about watching real people on stage not acting -- just being . It 's about relationships and humanity -- and human kindness . `` I play Sammy and also play the roller rink guard . I play the people with hot tempers and questionable decisions . Sammy is seeing Dina , but he also is married . The roller rink guard sees Egyptians in town and , automatically , his prejudice shows . `` A lot of what I speak in the show is in Hebrew . My Israeli friends helped me . We have five native Israelis in the cast .

When music fans think of bluegrass music , they think of the South -- especially the mountains . The southern Blue Ridge area has been known through generations and still today as a hotbed of old-time , bluegrass , blues , and country music . When people think of Kalamazoo , Michigan , they think of -- well , who knows what they think of . Maybe they know it 's the home of Western Michigan University . Guitar fans might know it as the home of Gibson Guitars . Not many people would link Kalamazoo with bluegrass music -- unless they are fans of Greensky Bluegrass . Greensky Bluegrass is a five-piece American bluegrass/rock band founded in Kalamazoo in 2000 featuring Anders Beck -LRB- dobro -RRB- , Michael Arlen Bont -LRB- banjo -RRB- , Dave Bruzza -LRB- guitar -RRB- , Mike Devol -LRB- upright bass -RRB- , and Paul Hoffman -LRB- mandolin -RRB- . `` We got our start in Kalamazoo , '' said Hoffman , during a recent phone interview from his home in Denver , Colorado . `` I met two of the guys -- Michael and Dave -- at open mics . We started playing together informally . Anders and Mike joined a little later and the five of us have been together ever since . '' Greensky Bluegrass has built a reputation for bringing rock ` n ' roll showmanship to high-energy bluegrass . `` When we first started , we were learning bluegrass but still had rock-and-roll roots , '' said Hoffman . `` So , we 've always approached it with a rock mentality . `` We were a single mic band for a long time . It has evolved from bluegrass to a psychedelic rock thing . It was a natural evolution -- learning new tricks step-by-step . `` Our instrumentation is dobro , banjo , mandolin , acoustic guitar and upright bass . Two of us -- myself and Dave -- write the songs and sing lead . Altogether , four of us sing . '' Greensky Bluegrass is known for pushing the limits of traditional bluegrass . According to Beck , `` We 're a rock-and-roll band that plays bluegrass instruments . Bluegrass is such a finite thing . Because you have a banjo and a mandolin , you 're supposed to do it a certain way . But we 've always been ourselves . '' For the past 18 years , the band has played up to 175 shows per year and sold out venues such as Red Rocks Amphitheatre and the Ryman Auditorium , as well as performed at festivals such as Bonnaroo , Austin City Limits , and Outside Lands . Last week , Greensky Bluegrass released a new live album -- `` Courage For The Road : Fall 2019 . '' It features 14 songs , hand-selected from various performances on their Fall 2019 tour and remixed and mastered by the band 's longtime studio engineer Glenn Brown . Now , Greensky Bluegrass has embarked on a tour to support the new album . The tour will make a stop locally on January 18 at The Met -LRB- 858 North Broad Street , Philadelphia , http://themetphilly.com -RRB- . Greensky Bluegrass has released 11 albums to date beginning with `` Less Than Supper '' in 2004 . All their releases have been on their own label -- Big Blue Zoo . `` We always just released our records on our own , '' said Hoffman . `` We released our records on Big Blue Zoo and have used national distribution companies along the way . CD Baby has been a big help . `` We did I all ourselves . Our fanbase is a thing that we 've been feeding and it 's growing every day . It 's interesting what you can do independently . `` Our fanbase has grown by word-of-mouth . Also , the festival world has been good for our kind of music . We 've been touring our asses off for 15 years -- 200 shows a year for a couple years in a row . We certainly went at it and hit the concrete hard . We played the entire country two times a year for eight years in a row . '' The band 's most recent studio album is `` All For Money , '' which was released in January 2019 and debuted in the top 10 of Billboard 's bluegrass chart . `` We recorded ` All For Money ' -- digital and tape -- at Echo Mountain Studio in Nashville , '' said Hoffman . `` We spent two weeks recording the tracks and used a lot of analog gear . We like the way tape sounds . We like some of that vintage character and warmth . `` We do n't pay too much attention to whether it 's bluegrass or rock . We just want to push the boundaries and keep challenging ourselves . '' Video link for Greensky Bluegrass -- https://youtu.be/VRwyBwt3dLk . The show at The Met -LRB- 858 North Broad Street , Philadelphia , http://themetphilly.com -RRB- There will be two interesting and very different shows in Wilmington , Delaware this weekend -- classical music by the Serafin Ensemble and non-mainstream humor by the Popovich Pet Comedy Theater . `` Serafin used to be Serafin String Quartet , '' said Artistic Director/violinist Kate Ransom , during a recent phone interview . `` That started in spring 2001 . It became Serafin Ensemble last season . We had been functioning as a quarter for a long time . This is the beginning of our first full season as Serafin Ensemble . `` We had a lot of changes happening in the viola seat . And , our residency as University of Delaware 's String Quartet was coming to an end . So , we decided to move away from the fixed line-up of a string quartet and move to a roster of artists . We wanted more work with other instrumentalists , so we changed to an ensemble . We have a roster of 11 with strings , piano , horn , flute and voice . '' Serafin Ensemble is presenting a musically diverse program on Sunday afternoon . The program will feature three pieces -- Michael Haydn 's `` Duo for violin and viola , '' Caesar Franck 's `` Piano Quintet , '' and Joseph Haydn 's `` Piano Trio in C Major Hob XV :27 . '' `` Hob XV :27 in C major '' is the first of a set of three trios dedicated to Therese Jansen , and published in London in 1797 , after Haydn had returned to Vienna . Jansen was another pianist whom Haydn had met during his two visits to London . In 1795 , at the age of 25 , she married Gaetano Bartolozzi and Haydn was a witness at their wedding . Haydn also dedicated to her two of his most important solo piano sonatas , in E flat and C major . This trio , with its virtuoso piano-writing , suggests that she was a very fine performer . Franck 's `` Piano Quintet in F minor '' is a quintet for piano , two violins , viola , and cello . The work was composed in 1879 and has been described as one of Franck 's chief achievements alongside his other late works such as Symphony in D minor , the Symphonic Variations , the String Quartet , and the Violin Sonata . The work , which has been described as having a `` torrid emotional power , '' features three movements -- Molto moderato quasi lento -- Allegro ; Lento con molto sentimento ; and Allegro non troppo ma con fuoco . On Sunday , the Serafin Ensemble lineup will feature Kate Ransom and Amos Fayette , violins ; Luke Fleming , viola ; Jacques-Pierre Malan , cello ; and Victor Asuncion , piano . Ransom is the artistic director of Serafin Ensemble and a distinguished chamber musician , recitalist and teacher who has presented hundreds of concerts in major chamber music concert halls in North America and Europe . Ms. Ransom pursued post-graduate chamber music study at The Juilliard School with Robert Mann and holds master 's and bachelor 's degrees in violin performance from Yale University and the University of Michigan , respectively . She currently serves as president of The Music School of Delaware and plays a violin made in 1728 by the Venetian master , Sanctus Serafin . Fayette started playing the violin at age two and made his professional debut at the age of eight . He enjoys a diverse career as a performer , educator , and administrator . He holds a bachelor 's degree from the Peabody Conservatory of the John Hopkins University and a master 's degree from the Julliard School of Music . He currently serves as director of The Music School of Delaware ` s Milford Branch .

The Popovich Comedy Pet Theater is a family-oriented blend of the unique blend of comedy and juggling skills of former Moscow Circus veteran Gregory Popovich and the extraordinary talents of his performing pets . His entourage consists of world-class jugglers , Diamond the Shetland Pony and a variety of performing pets including house cats and dogs , geese , white doves and parrots . There are more than 30 pets in the show . Each one of the dogs and cats has been rescued from animal shelters and given a new `` leash on life ! '' These rescued animals love to perform their skills and stunts on stage . According to Popovich , `` One of the main messages of my show is to bring attention for animal shelters , and the many homeless pets and rescue efforts out there . Because all my pets in my shows have been rescued by animal shelters , I feel it 's my mission to ` payback ' animal shelters and try to help other pets if I have this opportunity . '' Popovich 's unique philosophy toward animal training is to build tricks around the animals ' personalities , instead of pushing them to perform . His technique centers on positive reinforcement and compassion . Comedy Pet Theater is a new way to incorporate pets in showbiz while spotlighting the personality and individualism of each pet . The animal antics are adorable and amazing with dogs and cats jumping rope , riding scooters , jumping over hurdles , balancing on perilously thin beams and moving wheels , and even pushing a stroller ... with a dog in the baby basket . Popovich is a fifth-generation circus performer whose parents were stars of the Russian circus . It was in the Big Top where Popovich honed his natural ability by forming special bonds with the animals in his parents ' act . He learned to juggle at a very early age and went on starring in his first solo performance when he was barely a teenager . For the next few years , Popovich traveled the world with the Moscow Circus , eventually becoming the star of the circus and its representative at international circus competitions worldwide . He performed his juggling act in the center ring and became the first Russian artist to ever appear in the `` Greatest Show on Earth . '' Popovich , whose resume includes being voted `` Entertainer of the Year '' in Las Vegas , has shared his expertise for raising , training and living harmoniously with pets in two books -- `` You CAN Train Your Cat '' and `` Doggy Gone Good '' . He has also produced and starred in a feature film now available for purchase . `` Popovich and the Voice of the Fabled American West '' has already won several awards including `` Audience Choice Award '' at the Dances With Films Festival in Los Angeles , and International Film Festival in Austin , Texas . The Popovich Comedy Pet Theater has a rich performance history , presenting thousands of shows in more than 20 countries and is currently in its 12th season at the Planet Hollywood Resort/Casino in Las Vegas .

The movie had a long stop-and-go development process and then has since quietly moved along in its production . We 've seen trailers , but for some reason , it still did n't completely register , for one reason or another . As you can probably tell , I was n't exactly expecting much from this movie , and I ca n't be the only one . But , if the reviews are anything to go by , Bad Boys For Life could be the best film in the franchise . As of this writing , the film is north of 80 % on Rotten Tomatoes . Rolling Stone praises the film for its ability to evolve past the flaws of the franchise , and in spite of its heartless plot and dialogue , feel `` touched by human hands . '' `` Bad Boys For Life , the third chapter in the series , does n't exactly dodge those flaws , though it does move past them . It also raises two questions : Does anyone even remember Bad Boys after 25 years ? And will anyone care that this franchise is back ? It 's a shock to report that , yes , you will care . The first smart decision that this new entry makes is kicking Bay to the curb . '' TheWrap praises directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah , saying , `` It 's almost endearing how these wanna-Bays try to please those nostalgic for the Bruckheimer-bred glitzmeister 's surface gleam , swirling cameras and rock - ` em-sock - ` em action , and yet -- shhh ! -- these new guys are actually better than Bay ever was at directing the stars ' push-pull comic exchanges , which end up being this otherwise slapdash sequel 's brightest spots . '' THR , on the other hand , celebrates the leads , Will Smith and Martin Lawrence . `` It 's impressive and enjoyable to behold how easily Smith and Lawrence slide back into these characters and actually make them more accessible and fun to be around than before . Mike gives Marcus plenty of crap about riding into the sunset while maintaining that he 's `` going to be running down criminals until I 'm a hundred . '' EW , while still positive , is a bit more mixed on the movie . `` Luckily for -LSB- the directing duo who loves explosions -RSB- , a good portion of the plot involves blowing things up : buildings , helicopters , humans . Though the movie is always at its best when it lets the chemistry between its two costars breathe ; when it does n't , it 's mostly interchangeable with any other fast , furious thriller that passes through the multiplex . '' Not all the reviews are Fresh , though even this Rotten one from CNN acknowledges many of the same strengths as above , and even reads more positive than its Fresh counterparts . All the same , they seem less entranced by what it has to offer . `` As is , this update of a brand of buddy action-comedy Hollywood churned out with regularity way back when is a pretty shoot-by-numbers affair , beyond the mild kick of acknowledging that the central duo are getting a bit old for this sort of thing . '' All in all , this sounds like it could be a bit tiring , a bit old , but if you just turn your brain off and enjoy spending time with these characters once again , you may just have a good time .

The elderly resident complained about the mailbox being blocked over and over again and not receiving the mail as a result . City Council members Jan. 9 unanimously passed an ordinance amending the traffic code section 351.03 `` Prohibited standing or parking places . '' `` No person shall stand or park a vehicle , except when necessary to avoid conflict with other traffic or to comply with the provisions of this Traffic Code , or while obeying the directions of a police officer or a traffic control device , in any of the following places . '' A list of 28 incidents are listed , including the new addition of `` in front of or within 25 feet of a mailbox . '' Police Chief Ronald Williams said they usually talk to people first before issuing a parking ticket . `` People are pretty cooperative and they move their car , but in this incident they moved it initially but blocked the mailbox over and over and did n't comply so council had to make it a law . '' Parking violations are administered under local jurisdiction and it is a $ 5 fine if paid at the Tallmadge Police Station within 72 hours . After 72 hours but within 30 days the fine is $ 10 . After $ 30 day but before 45 days , the fine rises to $ 100 . After 45 hours , the ticket is sent to Stow Municipal Court and is subject to the fines imposed by the judge and court costs which can be substantial , Williams said . In the ordinance passed , some of the reasons involved the United States Postal Service , `` whose mission is to provide reliable , efficient , trusted and affordable universal delivery service that connects people and helps businesses grow . '' `` The USPS is the only delivery service that reaches every address in the nation ; and the residents of the City of Tallmadge rely upon USPS for service ; and USPS is unable to provide a reliable service to the residents of the City of Tallmadge in the event a resident 's mailbox is blocked by a vehicle parked on the street ; and it is essential the residents of the City of Tallmadge have reliable access to USPS services ; and USPS mail carriers need a clearance of 25 feet surrounding a mailbox to provide reliable mail delivery service ; and the City of Tallmadge seeks to promote the health and well-being of all its citizens , '' according to the ordinance . A list of 28 parking violations residents should be aware of include : 1 -RRB- On a sidewalk , except a bicycle may be parked parallel to the streets ; 2 -RRB- In front of or within five feet of a public or private driveway ; 3 -RRB- In front of or within 25 feet of a mailbox ; 4 -RRB- Within an intersection ; 5 -RRB- Within 10 feet of a fire hydrant ; 6 -RRB- On a crosswalk ; 7 -RRB- Within 25 feet of , and upon the approach to , any flashing beacon , stop sign or traffic control device ; 8 -RRB- Within 30 feet of , and upon the approach to , any flashing beacon , stop sign or traffic control device ; 9 -RRB- Between a safety zone and the adjacent curb or within 30 feet of points on the curb immediately opposite to end a safety zone , unless a different length is indicated by a traffic control device : 10 -RRB- Within 30 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad crossing ; 11 -RRB- Within 20 feet of a driveway entrance to any fire station and , on the side of the street opposite the entrance to any fire station , within 75 feet of the entrance when it is properly posted with signs ; 12 -RRB- Alongside or opposite any street excavation or obstruction when such standing or parking would obstruct traffic ; 13 -RRB- Alongside any vehicle stopped or parked at the edge or curb of a street ; 14 -RRB- Upon any bridge or other elevated structure upon a street , or within a street tunnel ; 15 -RRB- At any place where signs prohibit stopping , standing or parking , or where the curbing or street is painted yellow , or at any place in excess of the maximum time limited by signs ; 16 -RRB- Within one foot of another parked vehicle ; 17 -RRB- On the roadway portion of a freeway , expressway , thruway , or major thoroughfare ; 18 -RRB- In front of any funeral director 's establishment ; 19 -RRB- On the streets of the city when the purpose of such parking is demonstrating the vehicle or an article in it for sale or for the purpose of advertising ; 20 -RRB- In such temporary non-parking areas as may be occasioned by public improvements , traffic conditions , or other emergencies when so designated and posted by the safety director ; provided , however , that such temporary non-parking shall not be allowed to exist for a period of longer than 90 days ; 21 -RRB- Within the area known as Tallmadge Circle , except where parking space is provided immediately in front of the Tallmadge Old Town Hall , unless otherwise provided by the safety director ; 22 -RRB- Backed up to the curb unless it is actually loading or unloading and in such case not longer than 20 minutes unless a permit therefor is obtained from the safety director allowing an extension of time . Such extension , in no case , shall exceed one hour ; 23 -RRB- Upon the traveled portion of limited-access highways within the city ; 24 -RRB- On a strip of land paralleling the curb ; or where there is no curb , the edge of the roadway , and the sidewalk ; or where there is no sidewalk , the property line of the abutting property , commonly referred to as the side strip or devil strip ; 25 -RRB- In the ditch within a public right of way , street or highway ; 26 -RRB- On any other portion of a public right of way , street or highway not otherwise prohibited for more than two hours ; 27 -RRB- Within the front yard setback in any residentially-zoned district except upon an improved surface which shall be constructed of concrete , asphalt , permeable type pavers , gravel or other hard surface maintained to be free of excessive weeds and grass intrusion ; and 28 -RRB- On any such portion of a public roadway designated and posted by the director of public safety .

In his upcoming memoir `` Living in Color , '' Davidson writes that the pair were filming a sketch in which Foxx was playing one of his breakout characters , Wanda -- who truly believed she was the most gorgeous woman in the world -- who was giving Davidson a massage . The `` Strictly Business '' actor claims Foxx veered off script by strenuously pulling on Davidson 's underwear , trying to rip them off and leaving him naked . Davidson says it was lucky he was lying down because his first reaction was to sit up and `` bust him in his mouth , saying , ` What the f -- k , motherf -- ka ! ''' Davidson surmises that Foxx did it for no other reason than to get a cheap laugh at his expense . He writes that although Foxx is talented , he was `` competitive '' and his style of humor was to be `` mercilessly mean . '' He claims that when the `` Ray '' star discovered he could score points with series creator Keenen Ivory Wayans by making fun of Davidson , he was relentless . When the pair were reunited in 1997 on the movie `` Booty Call , '' the tensions immediately resurfaced . Davidson claims that Foxx refused to understand the concept of `` supporting actor '' and `` was determined to steal every scene he could . '' As Davidson tells it , one day Foxx challenged Davidson to a game of one-on-one basketball and even though Davidson says Foxx was trash-talking throughout , it did n't help his score -- which was soon 9-0 . Davidson says he then went for a layup and Foxx proceeded to charge him . `` If I had hit my head on the hardtop concrete , that would have been the end of me , '' he writes . `` I was ready to give Jamie some street-fighting lessons too , but the crew pulled us off each other and held me back .

Discretion is advised . by Connor Zimmerman \u201920 I stand there in the corner absorbing everything around me . The sounds , the music , and the vibrations crawl their way underneath my skin . The sweat streams down my face , as the heat dances around the room . The smell of drinks envelops me in my corner of the basement . Why did I agree to come here ? I look over and see two of my friends high-fiving as they chug their drinks . Some of my other friends are yelling at each other across the pong table . I hope to God that I have some plastic bags in my car . As I look away from my friends , I see a girl dance her way through the crowd towards the keg . She moves and twirls through the packs of people till she is almost in front of the line . As she fills up her drink , she looks around the room . She looks over at me , and she smiles . I try to lift my head over the crowd to get a better look . Ca n't see anything with the one string of Christmas lights in this basement . Suddenly , she is moving through the crowds towards me . I guess I 'm not invisible in this corner . She comes up to me and screams over the loud music , `` So what 's your deal ? You 've been here forever and have n't gotten a drink yet . '' It 's really annoying when everyone wants to know why you are n't drinking . `` I 'm just hanging around keeping an eye on my friends . '' I point them out , and she takes a look as one of them is vomiting in the corner . Laughing , `` Well I 'm sure the car ride home will be fun . '' `` I 'm sure I wo n't forget it . What about you ? '' `` I came over for another drink ... and to talk to the only guy with a little mystery in this place . '' `` Huh , mystery ? Should I take that as a compliment or am I an experiment for your psych 101 class ? '' `` Only one way to find out . Let 's go upstairs into my office . '' She grabs my hand and pulls me through the crowd with her . She leads me up some flights of stairs , and I try to get a better look at her as we climb up the stairs . Her long dark brunette hair bouncing up and down her back makes it hard to get a good look . We come to a living room where the music 's dim echoes are somehow still alive , and the sudden lights blind me . She pushes me , and I fall backwards onto a couch as she disappears . Maybe this was n't a good idea . I should just leave . Before I can get up from the couch , she comes back into the room with a chair and puts it in front of the couch . `` So , Doc what 's the plan here ? Do you always do business where you live ? '' Without a response she dives in , `` So how often do you choose to be the sober one among your friends ? '' Drawn aback , I pause . `` I 'm not entirely sure . No one wants to be the driver , but I 'm willing to take the hit . '' Leaning closer to me , `` So , Mister Mystery , are you a push-over or are you afraid ? '' Her words are playful , but her eyes are harsh . With a smile I ask , `` Ca n't I just be a good friend ? '' She smirks and stares at me , `` A good friend would n't be the sober one every time , and I have a feeling you 're the usual sober one . A friend is comfortable around those he calls ` friends , ' and is n't afraid to speak up for himself . '' I nod my head in frustration . `` Well maybe I just do n't like drinking . '' She shakes her head and gets up from her chair . Taking a seat on the couch next to me , she says , `` The way you look at everyone says otherwise . While you stand in the corner , your eyes have a flash of either annoyance or anger ... How am I doing ? '' Inching away from her on the couch , I remain silent . Do I tell her the truth ? Maybe it will just end whatever this is faster . With a torturous smile she asks , `` A one-sided conversation is no fun , maybe we should do something else ? '' I should leave . I stand up and say , `` I think I should go check in on my friends ... they are probably fighting about whether their elbows were over the table during pong . '' She looks at me funny . `` Maybe I will make this a little clearer . '' She stands up and leans closer to me . Her perfume mixed with a smell of cheap beer draws me in . Her body begins to touch mine , as she reaches her arms around me . As her hand touches my neck , my body feels like it is about to go limp . Her lips approach mine , and I lean forward to kiss her . Suddenly the faint music begins to grow and grow and grow until they are screaming . Images begin to flash in my head : a girl smiling at me from across the basement , her hand giving me a drink , the sun striking my face in the morning as I see my clothes by the side of the bed . I ca n't breathe . I begin to pull away , as I gasp for air . I run towards the bathroom and slam the door behind me . I dry heave into the toilet , as tears begin to well up in my eyes . I hear a soft knock on the door . `` Hey , is everything okay ? '' Trying to calm myself down , I move from the toilet to the sink . Splashing some water on my face , I look in the mirror and instead of my reflection I see a bed with messed up sheets and a man sitting with his head in his arms . The door begins to carefully open , as she peeks her head in the bathroom . `` Hey , whenever you feel okay , I have a glass of water out here if you need it . '' I nod my head , still staring in the mirror . She nods back and closes the door . Breathe in , breathe out . *** I come out of the bathroom and sit back down on the couch next to her . Her hand reaches out with the glass of water , but I just shake my head . `` So , was my breath that bad ? '' She asks with a smile . Staring at the wall ahead , `` No , it was n't that . '' `` First time ? '' `` Nope . '' `` Gay ? '' Looking at her , `` Is this some sort of damn game to you ? '' She looks down at the floor , `` No . I 'm sorry ... I ... I guess I just had a little too much to drink and ... . '' Silence sits in the room between us on the couch . I let it linger so that I 'm not the only one that is uncomfortable in the room . Shaking my head , I say , `` It happened probably close to a year ago . It was a night just like tonight : loud music , a dirty basement , cold and cheap beer . I guess it was fine until ... it was n't . I started talking to this girl and when my cup was empty , she said she would grab me a drink . It must have happened around then , because I do n't remember much else ... just flashes . It felt like a dream . It still does n't feel real sometimes . '' She looks at me and then back down to the floor . `` I 'm sorry that happened to you . I 've known people that have been ... I guess I just did n't really know them ... you know . '' `` Yeah I know . '' `` Christa . '' `` What ? '' `` That 's my name . '' `` Jason . '' `` I 'm okay taking things slow . I know a great Chinese place in the next town over . I mean if you are free next weekend ? '' She asks looking at me . I look over at her and smile , `` Yeah I would like that .

The response from the NRA -LRB- National Rifle Association -RRB- was less vitriolic than the response from the True Health Initiative . '' Sexist insinuations Dr. Laine notes that before studies showing that the evidence linking red meat consumption with cardiovascular disease and cancer were too weak to be the basis of dietary recommendations were even published , the True Health Initiative summoned an army of bots to flood her email inbox with complaints . Then Katz , Hu , and Willett and more -LRB- 1 -RRB- attempted to pressure her into retracting the papers - prior to publication. , and they probably violated journal embargo rules by passing the paper around to allies so they could apply pressure in advance . They then used their conspiracy network to claim the study authors were probably bought off by Big Beef , and the New York Times rushed to print the allegations provided by their longtime epidemiology sources . Marion Nestle , who will often invent conspiracies if she ca n't find them , chimed in and agreed it was probably true . They alleged one Canadian epidemiologist who got funding from a food nonprofit -LRB- to study sugar ! -RRB- too far in the past to merit disclosure controlled the conclusions of the entire group . All those female scholars in the list of 14 co-authors were being controlled by a male authority figure who told them what to believe , was what True Health Initiative was suggesting . How 1978 . It 's almost like casual sexist Michael Jacobson of Center for Science in the Public Interest was creating their strategy . Oh wait , he is on their board . If you ever got a grant from a nonprofit founded by a soda executive in 1978 , you ca n't be trusted about beef -LRB- ?! -RRB- The `` industry ties '' True Health Initiative were insisting tainted the study were not even related to meat . It was a grant from a group and the research resulted in an analysis which showed sugar was not a magical poison , calories are what matter , but True Health Initiative , New York University , the New York Times and more all claimed that the 2019 paper about beef was illegitimate because an epidemiologist once got funding on a study about sugar from an organization founded by a former Coca-Cola executive - in 1978 . The funding source controls the content is always problematic . Should Republicans deny science funded by NIH during the Obama years because Democrats ran the place ? -LRB- 2 -RRB- And True Health Initiative is downright hypocritical about their own funding . `` I think there 's a big difference between conflict of interest ... vs a confluence of interest . The work you do is what you care about ... No one 's ever paid me to say anything I do n't believe , '' claimed Dr. Katz to Rita Rubin of JAMA . It got even sillier . The Harvard epidemiologists and their allies , everywhere from IARC to the like-minded National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences , even tried to claim the data were invalid because the authors did n't disclose if they ate meat . Dr. Laine is so relaxed about True Health Initiative bots targeting her that if World War III happens , I am on her team - `` I can understand it 's upsetting when the limitations of your work are uncovered and discussed in the open . '' The ` past funding ' allegations fell on deaf ears outside the usual Science Is A Corporate Conspiracy cabal in that northeast corridor of elite , white schools . New York University Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute openly propagated the smear campaign against the work , as did Mother Jones employees and their other political allies in the war against science , but the public already knew what the Annals of Internal Medicine paper found was true . A normal diet was not killing people , no matter what an organization that promotes its own vegetarian diet plan claims . What they left out was that the True Health Initiative has lots of industry ties True Health Initiative has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars but their Form 990 does not disclose where that money is derived . Nor how more than $ 18,500 has been spent , even though it 's over $ 120,000 on vague things like `` management . '' But we can infer where that money is coming from , because they have a `` Partners '' page where they list 28 different companies . Is it irony when a group with so many industry partners accuses someone of none of being industry-controlled ? It may be basic human psychology . People who engage in questionable behavior often rationalize that everyone does . The old legal joke goes that when a judge asks a fellow accused of lifting wallets if he wants a trial by judge or jury the man replies , `` You judge , I do n't want 12 pickpockets deciding what happens to me . '' They tried to get the FTC and the Philadelphia district attorney to go after the journal True Health Initiative may simply assume everyone has `` industry partners . '' Perhaps that is why the people involved tried to get the United States Federal Trade Commission and the District Attorney for the city of Philadelphia to launch investigations into Annals of Internal Medicine . Willett essentially libeled longtime New York Times science reporter Gina Kolata in a presentation he gave , which produced a robust retort from the #scicomm community . BMJ was happy to produce a `` come under fire from critics '' about its competitor . Holy crap nutrition is getting as bad as GMOs , with the YES-MEAT and NO-MEAT camps digging in and lobbing nasties over the parapet . Here 's a slide from a presentation by Walter Willett -LRB- ! -RRB- calling responsible people working in good faith purveyors of `` disinformation . '' pic.twitter.com/n24Qe2rKOp -- Tamar Haspel -LRB- @TamarHaspel -RRB- November 6 , 2019 You know who has never behaved that way ? Any beef trade group . Even Monsanto , which the activist community loves to hate , did n't engage in the kind of dirty tricks True Health Initiative mobilized . Science Is A Vast Conspiracy Theory narratives aside , when they sought to undermine the methods in the ` beef is not killing you ' studies , systematic reviews , they undermined a lot of food studies , including their own . If actual randomized clinical trials are useless for nutrition , what does that say about the Harvard , and everyone else in the vegetarian epidemiology sphere , penchant for linking diseases to what foods people wrote in their diaries ?

A judge dismissed criminal charges against a former Kenosha teacher alleged to have shown a partially nude photograph of a man she was dating to a student . Meiranda Patterson , 26 , a former teacher at LakeView Technology Academy , was charged in November with exposing a child to harmful material , a felony . Patterson was alleged to have shown a 14-year-old female student a photograph on her phone of a man Patterson was dating . The photograph showed `` a naked male showing his shoulders down to the top of his thighs including his pubic area , '' according to the criminal complaint . The student told investigators she was embarrassed and disgusted when the teacher showed her the picture at school . Defense attorney Terry Rose argued the photograph did not rise to the level of harmful material required by the statute . In his motion , Rose said the photograph was not pornography and was no more explicit than photographs often seen in popular culture . `` The photo in question shows less nudity than the famous statue of David by Michelangelo , a masterpiece of Renaissance sculpture created between 1501-1504 , '' Rose wrote . `` Would it be a crime to show a 14-year-old such as -LRB- the student -RRB- a photo of David ? '' The state argued against dismissal , saying the photograph met the definition of nudity or sexually explicit conduct . We ca n't do it without you .

But he said he overruled binding the case over because he felt the state had not met the burden of showing the photo was harmful material . `` The picture was not in evidence . Based upon the description of it , I could n't find that that was harmful material , '' he said . `` The judge made it very clear that he was not saying this was a wise thing for a teacher to do , '' Rose said . Patterson was a special education teacher at LakeView beginning in August 2015 . She was placed on leave immediately after the school learned of the incident and was terminated on Dec. 17 , according to Kenosha Unified School District spokeswoman Tanya Ruder . Rose said whether Patterson should have been fired for showing the student the photo was a separate matter . `` That 's a different issue .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrhKcRi", "title": "The Astros Deserve Their Punishment For Cheating , But Was It Severe Enough ?", "content": "Major League Baseball 's release of their report -LRB- along with punishment -RRB- of the Houston Astros cheating scandal sent shockwaves through the sports world earlier this week . Three notable World Series champions have lost their jobs over the past few days , and everyone has had some time to reflect following some immediate hot-takes . The Astros were a pretty likable team during the championship run a few years ago , going from the basement to developing a bunch of homegrown talent -- it looked like a team that did things the right way . Now , we need to put that aside and look at things from an objective perspective . Based on the numbers , the benefit of illegal sign-stealing is undeniable . Here are the home and road splits for the Astros during their 2017 World Series run : Home vs. Road Splits -LRB- 2017 Postseason -RRB- Record Home -LRB- 8-1 -RRB- | Road -LRB- 3-6 -RRB- Runs Per Game Home -LRB- 5.7 -RRB- | Road -LRB- 3.0 -RRB- Batting Average Home -LRB- .273 -RRB- | Road -LRB- .208 -RRB- Home Runs Home -LRB- 18 -RRB- | Road -LRB- 9 -RRB- On-Base Percentage Home -LRB- .343 -RRB- | Road -LRB- .284 -RRB- Slugging Percentage Home -LRB- .519 -RRB- | Road -LRB- .347 -RRB- I know how it is : sometimes a team can just be `` feeling it '' at home for a postseason series while falling into a funk on the road for whatever reason . But to have a large sample size of 18 games like this , it 's impossible to ignore the impact cheating might have had on the 2017 postseason and eventual world title for Houston . Those that have played sports probably have tried to toe the line and get an edge at one point or another during a game , but the Astros went much further than trying to pick things up in the heat of a nine-inning contest . The report makes it sound like an elaborate scheme where the Astros batters knew what pitches were coming in a very cheap way . The only time stealing signs via video might not have much of an impact is when a baserunner is on second base , as signs are then switched up , and it 's not as simple as the typical one finger for four-seam fastball , two fingers for a breaking ball , etc. . Trying to infiltrate an opposing team 's signs is like a game within the game -- bench players try to do it all the time , and there is nothing wrong with that . However , zooming on a catcher 's signs and then relaying it to the batter is an entirely different story ; it is a significant upper hand for the batter as opposed the minor edge from stealing signs the old fashioned way . The use of video versus stealing signs with the naked eye would have been like Paul Revere using today 's high-tech reconnaissance to track the enemy and alert his allies instead of going on `` The Midnight Ride '' . There has been some talk that using video to steal signs does n't make a big impact , but Major League Baseball 's report states that former Astros manager A.J. Hinch removed the monitor twice because he did not like what was going on , only for it to be re-installed -- a considerable number of Houston players clearly wanted the sign-stealing operation to continue , indicating the impact was indeed notable , at least for a few members of the team . The punishment was swift and severe : year-long suspensions for general manger Jeff Luhnow and manager A.J. Hinch , the loss of first - and second-round draft picks the next two years , and a $ 5 million fine . However , in the court of public opinion , it seems the punishment was not severe enough , especially in the eyes of many former players and current league executives . The slope could be too slippery , as it could later come out that more teams cheated the way the Astros -LRB- and potentially the 2018 Red Sox -RRB- have . Multiple world championships being stripped -LRB- many would like to see Houston 's rings taken away -RRB- would be a terrible look for baseball . This does certainly impact the legacy for the champion Astros and their players , and cheating will now likely be the first thing associated with the 2017 squad as a whole . The roster does appear to be fortunate to avoid any asterisks on their title or individual statistics , which many people would probably be in favor of , though . As Alex Rodriguez has shown by being welcome throughout baseball -- including as a key face of MLB coverage on television -- despite being a cheater that lied about his PED use , the cheating scandal should n't do much to impact Houston 's players individually . Could it impact a Hall of Fame case for someone like Jose Altuve or Alex Bregman ? Possibly , especially if they are on the borderline , but they still have long careers to show people they are great players on their own . The key for Major League Baseball is that the punishment does send a clear message -LRB- it cost Luhnow and Hinch their jobs -RRB- without having to have a massive black eye on the sport by stripping a World Series champion of a title . There is a definite integrity issue that many fans -- not to mention the Los Angeles Dodgers -LRB- lost to the Astros in 2017 and then the Red Sox , also under investigation for cheating , in 2018 -RRB- and some of the pitchers that faced Houston 's hitters over the years -- will still have a tough time of getting over . Overall , it is a sad situation for the sport , but at least Major League Baseball went severe on the punishment , even if it was n't quite severe enough .", "url": "https://www.whitewolfsports.com/mlb/the-astros-deserve-their-punishment-for-cheating-but-was-it-severe-enough/", "kws": ["Punishment", "Houston^^Astros", "Major^^League^^Baseball", "Houston^^players", "MLB^^coverage", "Fame^^case", "Batting^^Average^^Home", "Batting^^Average", "Major^^League", "manager^^A.J.^^Hinch", "bench^^players", "Jose^^Altuve", "Game^^Home", "year-long^^suspensions", "eventual^^world^^title", "four-seam^^fastball", "Home^^Runs^^Home", "time", "shockwaves", "investigation"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Baseball": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Baseball_MLB": 1.0}}}
0.0	{"docid": "0NrhXZLy", "title": "6-Pack Thursday : Let 's Talk 2020 NFL Draft Prospects 3.0", "content": "I 've had a fun week of evaluating prospects and want to talk about some of those players I studied . This week 's 6-Pack is again focused on discussing players I recently evaluated in a different format . I hope that this column has become a staple for you each week , but just in case you are new , 6-Pack Thursday is my weekly brain dump on six football-related things that involve the NFL , college football or NFL draft . Let 's crack this thing open . Jedrick Wills , OT , Alabama Jedrick Wills is a joy to watch on tape . His performances against Auburn and LSU were arguably the best two games of film I 've watched for any offensive linemen in the 2019 or 2020 class . Wills displayed plenty of flashes in 2018 and his power was easy to fall in love with last season , but he put together the technical side of things this year . I believe he 's the best offensive linemen in the class . Wills is so smooth . His ability to frame rushers on the perimeter , stay square and stymie rushers is second to none . Rushers literally come to a halt with the roadblocks Wills sets up by reaching his set points and taking away rush angles . He is outstanding in space and is truly a fit for all schemes . Do n't get hung up that he played exclusively on the right side in Alabama . First , quarterback Tua Tagovailoa is left-handed so he was the blindside protector . Secondly , Wills progress at right tackle makes me want to leave him there , but there 's nothing about his skill set that suggests he could n't play left tackle if that 's where his NFL team needed him to play . He 's OT1 . Damon Arnette , CB , Ohio State Like most , I was lukewarm on Damon Arnette entering 2019 but he had a terrific season and now I view him as a top-five cornerback in this year 's class . No , his shaky moments in 2017 and 2018 should n't be forgotten but I love to see upward growth from prospects who ascend throughout their career and play their best football as a senior . That 's Arnette . The first game I watched from him was versus Michigan State and let me just tell you I 'm certain Spartans wide receiver No. 7 is still having nightmares about how to beat Arnette 's jams in press coverage . He is dominant both in soft press or when tasked with truly creating jams at the release . Arnette is suffocating with his ability to crowd routes and disrupt timing . He 's patient and fluid in his pedal and you can just tell he has a natural ability to mirror routes . For a defense look for a press corner that also thrives in zone , Arnette should be an early starter . He 'd be a dream top half of the second pick . Neville Gallimore , DT , Oklahoma I love urgent defensive football players and that 's exactly what you get from Neville Gallimore . It was n't always the case when studying him last seasons but Gallimore flipped the switch in 2019 and put some incredible hustle plays on tape . Gallimore is one of those players that `` brings the juice . '' While Gallimore does attack the line of scrimmage with reckless abandon , he generally stays under control and shows strong penetration skills . His hands are powerful and he really developed counters to help him clear contact . His ability to rush the passer from the interior is really exciting and something that is of great value in the NFL . I do n't love Gallimore against the run . He has some inconsistency anchoring at the point and not getting washed against drive blocks . He 's one of those guys that brings the fight and a lot of power when in attack mode but if he has to fight for his gap there is something to be desired . But the things Gallimore does well can help an NFL defense get pressure in the face of the quarterback and that trumps some concerns about his ability to defend the run . A.J. Epenesa , EDGE , Iowa The Bill Belichick disciples are going to love A.J. Epenesa . He 's long , heavy-handed and has all the power in the world to defend the run and compromise the width of the pocket as a pass rusher . Epenesa stacked consecutive seasons of dominant tape in 2018 and 2019 but I really appreciate his technical growth this season . His pass rush arsenal and hand technique took a major step forward . He became more consistent with the timing and placement of his hands while taking full advantage of his length to play with extension and control blocks . Epenesa 's bull rush and push-pull moves are devastating . He simply puts a lot of stress on offensive tackles to anchor because of his blend of length , size and power . You wo n't come away from Epenesa falling for his burst or flexibility , but that 's not why he wins . While he eats up ground with his stride length and moves well , he wins because of power , length and technique . I think he 's such a clean evaluation and prospect to figure out . Epenesa has inside/outside rush ability in even fronts and there 's no doubt he can also play five-technique all at a high level . J.K. Dobbins , RB , Ohio State Good luck trying to poke holes in J.K. Dobbins ' game -- he 's such a complete running back . Dobbins is another prospect that improved throughout his career and dominated in his final year racking up 2,250 yards from scrimmage with 23 touchdowns . I love Dobbins ' vision , decision-making , pace , physicality and burst . That blend of traits enables him to effectively pound the rock between the tackles while also working off-tackle . He 's very natural and that becomes apparent by how he addresses late-flashing defenders . Dobbins is incredibly savvy in how quickly he responds to those situations and the comfort he shows adjusting his course . Dobbins has outstanding contact balance and he battles for every inch he can gain . For a back listed at 5-foot-10 , 217 pounds , Dobbins has more twitch and wiggle than expected . He 's good in pass protection and is a reliable receiver although I think he has room to grow as a route runner . Dobbins is the total package and will most likely be my RB1 . Mekhi Becton , OT , Louisville Mekhi Becton is one of those prospects that I wound up watching way more film than necessary to figure him out because he 's just so damn fun . He is 6-foot-7 , 370 pounds and takes up two full yards when in a two-point stance . Becton plays with a nasty demeanor and has mobility I never expected to find . The power components of his game are easy to spot . His punches are devastating and he drives men against their will with ease in the run game . If you need a vertical push , just run the ball behind Becton and prosper . He ragdolled college defensive ends and widened gaps to the point that an 18-wheeler can fit through them sideways . But what 's fascinating is how much lateral mobility Becton has . His reach and movement skills make him an outstanding zone blocker in addition to his obvious ability to move bodies in power concepts . In pass protection , I love Becton 's upside . He is a smooth operator that functions with body control and balance that you 'd never expect for a man of his stature . He has no issues redirecting , sliding his feet and keeping pace up the arc . And of course , his ridiculous length and functional strength increase his overall margin for error if his technique fails him . The 2020 offensive tackle class is loaded . But do n't assume anything about Becton because of his listed measurements . He has a high ceiling with more versatility than expected . I do think it is fair to mention his struggles with maintaining his weight in the past and how he performed prior to 2019 . But the coaching staff under Scott Satterfield got the best out of Becton and his arrow is pointing up .", "url": "https://thedraftnetwork.com/articles/6-pack-thursday--let-s-talk-2020-nfl-draft-prospects-3.0", "kws": ["NFL^^Draft", "prospects", "college^^defensive^^ends", "football", "LSU", "offensive^^linemen", "This^^week", "rushers", "consecutive^^seasons", "Bill^^Belichick", "Auburn", "5-foot-10", "DT", "college", "Alabama^^Jedrick^^Wills", "dominant^^tape", "things", "A.J.^^Epenesa", "OT", "OT1"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000052452087402}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Football": 1.0000052452087402}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Football_NFL": 1.0}}}

Town of Farragut 's 40th Anniversary celebration coincided with the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new Farragut Community Center/West Knox County Senior Center , with a joint program Thursday , Jan. 16 , in the gym the dual-centers will share inside the former Faith Lutheran Church building along Jamestowne Boulevard . `` It is an especially important day for Town of Farragut because today is the 40th anniversary of our incorporation , '' Farragut Mayor Ron Williams told the standing-room crowd . He then introduced three members of Farragut Community Group , the Town 's founding body from 1979 and 1980 : Marianne McGill , Betty Dick and Eric Johnson -- all three former aldermen . `` Walking through this beautiful community center yesterday , I could not help but get choked up . I began to reflect and was overwhelmed with gratitude to our determined town founders and volunteers and Board members who dedicated themselves to setting up the Town , which lives by high principals , '' Farragut Vice Mayor Louise Povlin said . `` It 's amazing to see how our Town has evolved and grown . `` I do n't know if it 's Kismet , serendipity , God 's blessing , just plain luck or dogged determination , hard work , sweat and tears -- or perhaps a combination of all of the above , '' she added . `` The Town of Farragut is 40 today . '' Then using the famous quote from Town of Farragut 's namesake , Admiral James David Glasgow Farragut , Poviln said , `` Damn the torpedoes , full speed ahead , '' to thunderous applause . `` Wow is all I can say -- this is wonderful , '' said McGill , whose late husband , former Mayor Ralph McGill -LRB- 2009-2018 -RRB- , also was a founder . `` This was a great dream of my husband for several years . He and -LRB- Town administrator -RRB- David Smoak worked very hard . When he was first elected , he said , ` one of things I want to do is bring County and Town together in Farragut and help us work together . We can all do good things , but together we can do more ; I want to thank Knox County for partnership ; I see nothing but great things ahead . '' Dick , who continues to contribute to the Town in various capacities -- currently as a member of the Town Municipal Planning Commission -- was overcome with emotion when she spoke . `` I 'm proud to be here , '' she said . `` I was one of the original founders . There were seven of us : two engineers , Ralph McGill and Eric Johnson ; two chemists , George Dorsey and Ron Simandl ; a highway patrolman , Gene McNalley ; me , a nurse ; and -LRB- the late -RRB- David Rodgers , our attorney . Dick broke down twice , with Povlin leaving her seat to offer support . `` It is a very emotional day for me . I 'm sorry , '' she said before continuing . `` We represented homeowners associations around here , Village Green , Fox Den , Kingsgate . You could say the -LRB- Knox County -RRB- Metropolitan Planning Commission and -LRB- Knox -RRB- County Commission had a big part in the formation of this Town because they approved everything that came before them . We were interested in reasonable responsible development , and they were not interested in what we wanted , so they inspired us . `` The vote was held on Jan. 15 -LRB- 1980 -RRB- -- about 1,300 people voted , she continued . `` We were disappointed in the low turnout , but the vote was 3 to 1 in favor of incorporation . David Rodgers and George Dorsey drove to Nashville -LRB- the next day -RRB- . We had our charter certified , and we became the Town of Farragut . `` I am proud to be part of the Town of Farragut , proud to have been a small part of that , and I am proud to be involved in the Town of Farragut . '' Dick went on to promote `` Full Speed Ahead , '' a book about Farragut 's founding written by former farragutpress reporter Heather Mays Beck . `` There are interesting parts I have left out , but you can read about them in ` Full Speed Ahead , ' available in the Farragut Museum , '' she said . Johnson spoke briefly , noting the building is the same age as the Town itself , constructed in 1980 . He also mentioned Mays ' book and thanked the farragutpress for its current series , Foundations , which chronicles the Town 's founding . Former Aldermen Jeff Dobson and Bob Markli spoke , as did several others , including Smoak and local real estate broker Jim Nixon , whom Williams credited with putting the centers ' deal together . Williams also presented a copy of `` Full Speed Ahead '' to Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs when he approached the podium . `` In all seriousness , I was going to stop and get a copy of this book after this , '' Jacobs said . New Community Center Jacobs prayed Knox County staff and officials with bringing about the new Senior Center , which was formerly located along Lovell Heights Road -LRB- Frank R. Strang Senior Center -RRB- . `` What makes this center so special is that it now has twice as much programming space and three times the parking , '' Jacobs said . `` This represents a tremendous partnership with Knox County and the Town of Farragut . I have heard a lot about their history today -- they have a lot to be proud of . `` This building represents what we can do , and I look forward to deepening that relationship and hope we can continue more projects like this one in the future , '' he added . Williams praised Town staff for helping the Community Center become a reality `` Without them , none of this could have happened , '' he said , adding the partnership `` allowed us to purchase and renovate this beautiful building for both of us to use . As you can tell , this is going to be a special place for all . '' Fittingly , the Rev. Dr. Robert `` Bob '' Stelter , pastor of Faith Lutheran Church , which had relocated to the former St. John Neumann Church facility several years ago , offered prayer to begin the program Knox County Commissioner John Schoonmaker -LRB- 5th District , which includes Farragut -RRB- also spoke , noting his No. 1 goal when he first took office five years ago was to secure a new Senior Center for West Knox County , and described how he and Buzz Buswell , director of Veteran & Senior Services for Knox County Government , scouted around for properties . `` When we first walked into this building , I thought , ` This is it , ''' said Schoonnaker , who went on to say the price was more than the county could afford at the time , until the partnership was created with the Town `` and Jim Nixon got involved . '' `` We all have been dreaming of this for a long time , '' Williams said . `` I do n't think we thought we would ever have anything as beautiful as this facility . '' The joint partnership between the Town and Knox County became official in late 2018 .", "url": "https://farragutpress.com/articles/2020/01/9158", "kws": ["Farragut^^Community^^Group", "Farragut^^Museum", "West^^Knox^^County", "Community", "Town^^staff", "Village^^Green", "dual^^celebration", "Town^^founders", "40th^^Anniversary", "Faith^^Lutheran^^Church", "Knox^^County^^Government", "5th^^District", "dignitaries", "Nashville", "Vice^^Mayor", "volunteers", "Lovell^^Heights^^Road", "Board^^members", "pastor", "prayer"], "text_category": {}}
0.0	{"docid": "0Nril2z1", "title": "45 Movies Worth Watching in Seattle This Weekend", "content": "The Oscar nominees were announced this past Monday , and many of the nominees , like Little Women and Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood are still in or returning to theaters . We 've noted which ones are up for awards below . -LRB- For more details on how to see all the nominees , check out our post here . -RRB- But there are many more fun and worthwhile films to watch , like the hallucinatory indie sci-fi trip The Wave , the silkily evil British classic Kind Hearts and Coronets , and the beautifully animated love story Weathering With You . See all of our film critics ' picks for this weekend below , and , if you 're looking for even more options , check out our film events calendar and complete movie times listings . Movies play Thursday -- Monday unless otherwise mentioned . * = Nominated for an Oscar Legendary screenwriter William Goldman once said of the film industry , `` Nobody knows anything , '' and this is still mostly true , with one exception : If cinematographer Roger Deakins shot the movie , that movie is worth seeing on the biggest screen possible . Even if 1917 were solely the most impressive work of Deakins ' remarkable career -- which it is -- I 'd be recommending it . But the World War I movie is also one hell of a stunning storytelling experience from director Sam Mendes , co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns , and editor Lee Smith . `` But wait , '' you say , `` is n't the whole point of this movie that there are n't any cuts ? Why did they need an editor at all ? '' 1917 's hook -LRB- or less generously , its gimmick -RRB- is that it 's meant to unfold in a single , unbroken take . It 's one of the rare instances of a film 's marketing actually benefiting the finished film , because of the way this knowledge is both paid off ... and then subverted . BOBBY ROBERTS Various locations Nominated for : Best Picture , Best Director -LRB- Sam Mendes -RRB- , Best Cinematography , Best Original Screenplay , Best Makeup & Hairstyling , Best Original Score , Best Production Design , Best Sound Editing , Best Sound Mixing , Best Visual Effects This annual film tour of abbreviated features includes the best of the best out of Sundance , all gathered together in one place for your viewing convenience . The seven 2019 films in the 96-minute theatrical program include the awkward yet sweet romance of Sometimes I Think About Dying , whose painfully introverted protagonist goes from wondering how corpse flies might feel walking around on her dead skin -LRB- `` like a billion tiny massages ? '' -RRB- to thinking about the thread count of her colleague 's sheets ; Muteum , a charming animated short from Estonia about a visit to the museum that takes a funny turn ; and Short Film Special Jury Award for Directing winner Fast Horse , a doc about our country 's first extreme sport , Indian Relay , where jockeys ride horses bareback and jump from one horse to another amid racing . Also screening : Suicide By Sunlight , Brotherhood , * The MINORS , and Crude Oil . LEILANI POLK Northwest Film Forum Friday -- Sunday The great fraud of streaming services -- and , perhaps , the entire internet -- is that we believe them to contain everything . But anyone who has been to Seattle 's Scarecrow Video knows that this is n't true . Scarecrow , the world 's largest video library , currently has around 130,000 available titles . Netflix , by my last count , has less than 4,000 available in the United States . Amazon 's Prime Video , while roughly four times larger than Netflix , still only offers a fraction of what you find in Scarecrow 's library . Which is to say , video stores are important . New ones , like Baltimore 's Beyond Video , seem to be popping up as we head into the new decade and viewers realize the limitations of streaming . At the Video Store -- a new documentary featuring interviews with John Waters , Bill Hader , Nicole Holofcener , Todd Haynes , Gus Van Sant , Thelma Schoonmaker , and The Stranger 's own Charles Mudede -- catalogs the great remaining video stores in the United States , including Scarecrow and Portland 's Movie Madness . CHASE BURNS Northwest Film Forum Thursday only Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back for a sequel , but -- happily -- without Michael Bay as director . In the reprise of this long-dormant franchise , the two cops take on one last case after an assassination attempt almost kills one of them . Various locations It 's unusual to witness real cinematic magic these days , but the Fred Rogers biopic A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood absolutely has it . Director Marielle Heller -LRB- Diary of a Teenage Girl , Can You Ever Forgive Me ? -RRB- wisely avoids the visual slickness one might expect from a Tom Hanks-centric melodrama , instead employing a lived-in style and scene transitions that consist of miniature cities harkening back to the opening of Mister Rogers ' Neighborhood . Hanks is totally committed to Rogers ' appearance and manner , but A Beautiful Day is more about Lloyd Vogel -LRB- Matthew Rhys -RRB- a fictional journalist profiling Rogers . -LRB- Vogel 's work is based on a 1998 Esquire profile by Tom Junod ; as is the case with the film , Junrod 's piece sketches a beautiful yet enigmatic image of Rogers . -RRB- Where Heller 's film becomes transcendent is in its cinematic pressure points : The striking slowness of the narrative -LRB- it 's meant to emulate the pace of Rogers ' show , and you get used to it -RRB- , the mirroring of Rogers and Vogel in their interview styles and drawn-out reaction shots , and a profound moment of silence that grips your heart like , `` Did that really just happen ? Why was that so intense ? '' SUZETTE SMITH Varsity Theatre Nominated for : Best Actor -LRB- Tom Hanks -RRB- Les Blank and Chris Strachwitz 's 1976 film , recently selected for the Library of Congress 's National Film Registry , is about the music of the Texas-Mexico border . Northwest Film Forum Friday -- Sunday Comic book legends Kelly Sue DeConnick and Matt Fraction will appear at this special screening of the exploitation classic set in the wake of a global economic crisis when the United States has abandoned democracy for totalitarianism and martial law -- a plot that was probably much more shocking in 1975 -LRB- when the film was made -RRB- than it is now . The Beacon Saturday only It 's difficult to gauge whether the picture 's evolution away from timelessness has more to do with its familiarity -- its centrality , even , to the contemporary sense of humor -- or with the inconvenient complexity of the current state of international affairs . Either way , Dr. Strangelove has changed . Or maybe it 's just gotten impossible to stop worrying . SEAN NELSON Central Cinema Friday -- Monday Linda Hoaglund 's art documentary reveals the creativity and boldness of Edo-era Japanese artists by filming artwork in collections around the world in 4K . Seattle Art Museum Monday only In 2016 , beloved documentarian Agn\u00e8s Varda took a trip through rural France with muralist JR , driving a box truck that doubled as a photo booth , creating murals of the people they met and establishing a friendship through their artistic -LRB- and uplifting -RRB- collaborations . SIFF Film Center Sunday only Part of The Restless Curiosity of Agn\u00e8s Varda At its worst , Fantastic Fungi gets too woo-woo wacky for its own good -LRB- when the film 's discussion turns to magic mushrooms , the visuals turn into what is , as far as I can tell , just a psychedelic screensaver from Windows 95 -RRB- , but at its best , the doc pairs fantastic time-lapse imagery with a good dose of actual , mind-blowing science . Affable , passionate mushroom researcher Paul Stamets is joined by talking heads Michael Pollan , Andrew Weil , and narrator Brie Larson to examine everything from massive fungal networks that carry signals between disparate , distant plants to the psychological benefits of psilocybin . It 's an uneven trip , but a good one . ERIK HENRIKSEN Varsity Theatre F v F is about how corporations ca n't help but crush the passion and innovation they so desperately need . In this case , the crushees are race car designer Carroll Shelby -LRB- Matt Damon -RRB- and driving phenom Ken Miles -LRB- Christian Bale -RRB- , both of whom are forced to cajole , finagle , and manipulate the suits at Ford in an attempt to win the famed Le Mans road race . Director James Mangold -LRB- Logan -RRB- smartly avoids the emotionally manipulative tricks found in other sports biographies , and Damon and Bale are , unsurprisingly , excellent and affecting . The problem ? It 's impossible to ignore the two elephants in this room : The fetishization of white male toxicity and car culture , topics which society is trying to deal with and solve ... not celebrate . This makes Ford v Ferrari a very good movie that , a decade ago , would 've been considered great . Now it feels like a brand-new film that 's already an antique . WM. STEVEN HUMPHREY Regal Meridian 16 & AMC Seattle 10 Nominated for : Best Picture , Best Editing , Best Sound Editing , Best Sound Mixing You 'll get a startling education from Tod Browning 's 1932 circus horror Freaks if you think that deeply fucked-up movies did n't exist before John Waters . A tawdry tale of carnival `` freaks ' '' brutal vengeance against two heartless lovers who exploit them , Freaks is not exactly a heartwarming or enlightening portrait of people with genetic differences and atypical physiognomies . However , the `` freaks '' are played by people with disabilities , and they do so with humanity -LRB- though they 're filmed with unsettling fascination -RRB- . Given how few portrayals of folks with disabilities can be found in non-medical contexts in classic film , Freaks remains an essential piece of film history , even if the representation is n't everything it should be . JOULE ZELMAN Central Cinema Friday -- Monday * Frozen II It starts out with Young Elsa and Young Anna , and , I do n't know , this is just my opinion , but I did n't think that part was very necessary , necessarily ? I thought the story was good . I thought the parts were well thought out and they had some depth to them , if you know what I mean ? Like some parts were really sad , and some parts could be interpreted in a lot of different ways . Also , you know how in the first Frozen , there 's like this main song that you know is the main song ? In this one , there 's like three or four different songs that could be that main song . There were songs that like Elsa and Anna and Kristoff sang that could qualify for that position . I thought they were fine . SIMON HAM , AGE 12 Various locations Nominated for : Best Original Song -LRB- `` Into the Unknown '' -RRB- Agn\u00e8s Varda 's most well-known documentary -LRB- her classification `` essay '' is more apt -RRB- , inspired by old paintings of the peasant `` gleaners '' who would sweep the fields , post-harvest , for free food , a practice still legal under French law . A tradition carried on in the present day by Roma as well as fun-seekers , and extended into urban life in the form of scavenging the remains of markets and dumpster diving , Varda 's full tour into this world reveals insights with social , environmental , self-reflective , and artistic relevance that are , as is characteristic of her work , ahead of her time . MARJORIE SKINNER SIFF Film Center Saturday only Part of The Restless Curiosity of Agn\u00e8s Varda The Good Liar is likely the most bonkers film I will see this year . What begins as a cautionary tale about the dangers of grandma 's online dating unfolds into a baffling series of reveals , all of which support the twist that we already gleaned from the trailer : Roy -LRB- Ian McKellen -RRB- is trying to double cross Betty -LRB- Helen Mirren -RRB- and take her money ... but she 's not that easy to trick ! How all that happens , though ? I could never have predicted it . What a septuagenarian mine cart ride ! SUZETTE SMITH Crest Aside from the assistance that the formerly enslaved Harriet Tubman got from the Underground Railroad , it 's hard to imagine exactly how she pulled off all her heroics . With Harriet , audiences are given a live-action reimagining of Harriet Tubman 's journey to self-liberation : changing her name , hiding in bales of hay , being chased by dogs , and getting cornered by armed men on a bridge before jumping into the river . Harriet shows how Tubman -LRB- Cynthia Erivo -RRB- got help from a secret network of safe houses and trusted free Blacks -LRB- Leslie Odom Jr. and Janelle Mon\u00e1e -RRB- who stuck their necks out to help her cause . Throughout the film , the only music you 'll hear , gladly , are negro spirituals -- songs that enslaved Blacks used to express their sorrow and joy , and to secretly communicate . Harriet does n't subject the sensitive viewer to excessive gore or violence -LRB- though there is one particularly unsettling scene -RRB- , because for once , this is a story in the `` slave movie '' genre about tremendous triumph , leadership , and Tubman 's unwavering faith , both in God and herself . JENNI MOORE Crest Nominated for : Best Actress -LRB- Cynthia Erivo -RRB- , Best Original Song -LRB- `` Stand Up '' -RRB- It 's August 2017 in New York City , and it feels like the end of the world . In this strikingly shot documentary , Brett Story explores the apocalyptic fears of the current zeitgeist , touching on everything from white nationalism to climate change-induced natural catastrophes . Sinister , beautiful , tense . Northwest Film Forum & SIFF Film Center Thursday -- Sunday In director Numa Perrier 's semi-autobiographical feature debut , a young woman named Tiffany is drawn -- by her own phone-sex-operator sister -- into the world of camgirling . Tiffany , the only black performer on her site , becomes very popular , and perhaps too close to one of their clients . By all reports , this film treats its sexually charged subject matter with tension and sensitivity instead of prurience . Seattle 's own erotic dance celebrity Ms. Briq House will speak after the screening about sex and body positivity . Ark Lodge Cinemas Thursday only The latest from Taika Waititi starts off with a bright , Wes Andersonian whimsiness : Young Jojo -LRB- Roman Griffin Davis -RRB- joyously bounces about at summer camp , having the time of his life as he frolics and laughs with his second-best friend Yorki -LRB- Archie Yates -RRB- and his first-best friend , the imaginary Adolf -LRB- Waititi -RRB- . Just one thing : Jojo is at Hitler Youth camp -- their campfire activities include burning books -- Adolf is Adolf Hitler , and World War II is winding down , with Germany not doing so great . Both because of and in spite of its inherent shock value , Jojo Rabbit -- based on a book by Christine Leunens -- is just as clever and hilarious as Waititi 's other movies , but as it progresses , the story taps into a rich vein of gut-twisting melancholy . There 's more to the complicated Jojo Rabbit than first appears , and only a director as committed , inventive , and life-affirmingly good-hearted as Waititi would even have a chance of pulling it off . He does . ERIK HENRIKSEN Various locations Nominated for : Best Picture , Best Production Design , Best Adapted Screenplay , Best Supporting Actress -LRB- Scarlett Johansson -RRB- , Best Costume Design , Best Film Editing , Best Production Design In this dramatization of a true , infuriating story , Michael B. Jordan plays the lawyer Bryan Stevenson , who , with the help of activist Eva Ansley -LRB- Brie Larson -RRB- , fights racism and systemic legal injustice to save the life of an innocent condemned man , Walter McMillian -LRB- Jamie Foxx -RRB- . Various locations One of the best -LRB- and most vicious -RRB- comedies to come out of London 's famed Ealing Studios , Kind Hearts and Coronets stars Dennis Price as a down-and-out scion of a snobbish aristocratic family who sets out to gain the ancestral inheritance ... by murdering all of his unloved relatives . All of whom are played by the magnificent Alec Guinness ! It 's mean , it 's hilarious , and it features the adorable , deep-voiced Joan Greenwood , who should be much better remembered today . JOULE ZELMAN The Beacon Friday -- Monday Knives Out -LSB- is -RSB- Rian Johnson 's phenomenally enjoyable riff on a murder-mystery whodunit . The less you know going in , the better , but even those familiar with mysteries will likely be caught flat-footed . Things begin in the baroque mansion of famed mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey -LRB- Christopher Plummer -RRB- , who is very , very dead . Through flashbacks , monologues , and the genteel but razor-sharp questioning of investigator Benoit Blanc -LRB- Daniel Craig -RRB- , we meet the rest of the Thrombeys -- played by Jamie Lee Curtis , Michael Shannon , Toni Collette , Katherine Langford , and more , with everyone clearly having a goddamn blast -- and we hear about a billion motives and a billion alibis . Somebody killed Harlan , and while Benoit Blanc is on the case , Knives Out quickly spirals into unexpected territory . In a time when filmgoing is dominated by familiar franchises , seeing an original movie executed with as much care , glee , and skill as Knives Out feels like an experience that 's entirely too rare .

In a suburb of Paris , Brigadier St\u00e9phane Ruiz takes part in an arrest that turns deadly , and the neighborhood responds with fury to the act of police brutality . Regal Meridian 16 Nominated for : Best International Picture Like a Boss is barely long enough to qualify as a feature film , clocking at an hour and 23 minutes -- which makes total sense , considering there 's not much meat on this story , aside from a couple of central themes : the evergreen dilemma of choosing between a career and motherhood , learning how to spot frenemies , and evolving for the sake of a valued friendship . Thankfully , the hilarious cast -- which includes Tiffany Haddish , Rose Byrne , and Salma Hayek -- makes this mediocre movie watchable . JENNI MOORE Various locations In Tobe Hooper -LRB- The Texas Chainsaw Massacre -RRB- 's campy space horror , a vessel returns to Earth with only one survivor , plus a troubling guest : an insanely hot alien-vampire capable of sucking life energy from every human she comes across . The surviving astronaut races against time -- and zombies -- to save the world from this fierce feminine menace . As the Beacon writes : `` What is LIFEFORCE ? The object of a constructed sexual desire manifested and returned to destroy its subject ? An inversion of ALIEN that replaces fear of bodily violation in a feminist register with the fear of losing control of an ideal exploited Other that exists only in the mind ? An apocalypse of secret queer desire protested too much ? '' The Beacon Friday only Some of the most underappreciated European movies came out of Czechoslovakia in the 1970s , an era in which governmental repression had clamped down on artistic political dissent , so filmmakers turned to rich , surreal fantasy . Karel Kachyna , one of the greats of the Czechoslovak New Wave , directed this version of the Hans Christian Andersen tragedy ; other masters of the dissident filmmaker movement , composer Zden\u011bk Li\u0161ka and cinematographer Jaroslav Ku\u010dera , lent their art to this dramatic take on the story of love and sacrifice . JOULE ZELMAN The Beacon Saturday -- Monday I say this with my whole heart : Greta Gerwig 's Little Women is wonderful . Full of wonder , inspiring wonder , embodying wonder . Which is hard to do as the eighth adaptation of Louisa May Alcott 's beloved 1868 novel of the same name . Gerwig 's adaptation -- which she both wrote and directed -- feels neither redundant nor stale . Rather , it 's a fresh , modern-feeling take on a well-trodden story , stuffed with excellent performances , witty dialogue , and gorgeous costumes . The film jumps between Jo 's `` present '' life in a post-Civil War America and her childhood , living at home with her three other sisters and mother , awaiting the family patriarch to return home from the war as they struggle to make ends meet . The direction and sense of characters are particularly strong in this adaptation . It fleshes each sister out so that she feels real and worthy of empathy , not purely serving as a star vehicle for Ronan in the same way the Winona Ryder version arguably did .

The Beacon Sunday only As was the case in Noah Baumbach 's Squid and the Whale , the specifics are aggressively upper class : Nicole -LRB- Scarlett Johansson -RRB- is a big-deal actress , Charlie -LRB- Adam Driver -RRB- is an acclaimed theater director , and along with their young son Henry -LRB- Azhy Robertson -RRB- , they spend much of Marriage Story at either a bougie apartment in Manhattan or a bougie house in West Hollywood . But once again , Baumbach -- within the film 's opening seconds , even -- drills down to unearth the singular combination of grief , fury , melancholy , and pain that can only come from divorce . Marriage Story is brutal and sharp , but it 's also funny and sweet , and captures something that 's impossible to put into words : The feeling of life as it changes , and the feeling of stories as they come to an end .

Two of these people -- the ones who 're beginning to realize the world is no longer all that interested in what they have to offer -- are fictional . The third is not , and how much you know about the real-life events that occurred in and around Los Angeles in 1969 will profoundly color your experience watching the film .

It 's a departure from the sci-fi bent of his recent movies , though it 's no less concerned with the state of society today . Set in Seoul , South Korea , the families and class issues at play reflect our global era , in which the disparity between the haves and have-nots seems to be widening . Parasite follows the Kim family , who secretly scam their way into the lives of the wealthy Park family . Slowly and methodically , the Kims begin to drive out the other domestic workers at the Park residence , each time referring another family member -LRB- who they pretend not to know -RRB- for the vacant position . And so the poorer family starts to settle comfortably into the grift -- until a sudden realization turns their lives upside down .

It 's a coming-of-cannibal tale by Julia Ducournau that 's as atmospheric as Let the Right One In , as dark as the 2007 's under-seen vagina dentata saga Teeth , and a Bildungsroman that makes The Hunger Games look like a tiptoe down the candy aisle .

COURTNEY FERGUSON Scarecrow Video Friday only I thought Spies in Disguise was very excellent . The plot device of someone turning into a pigeon through genetic manipulation was unique , to say the least .

Although that might not be true in any way . I 'm almost definitely sure there 's going to be a second one of these . SIMON HAM , AGE 12 AMC Pacific Place & Thornton Place Thursday only I found The Rise of Skywalker , the last film in the Skywalker saga , boring . And it was not even a long movie , and I 'm a fan of the director 's -LRB- J.J. Abrams -RRB- work -LRB- particularly Mission : Impossible III -- the best in that franchise -RRB- , and many of the visual effects are impressive -- particularly the haunting business of bringing the late Carrie Fisher back to life . But all together , the film is burdened by too much sentimental family stuff -LRB- you are my granddaughter , you are my son , you killed my parents , and so on -RRB- , and its end did not know how to end for a very long time . CHARLES MUDEDE Various locations Nominated for : Best Visual Effects , Best Original Score , Best Sound Editing As Howard Ratner , a professional jeweler and asshole in Manhattan 's Diamond District , a great Adam Sandler rarely leaves the screen in Uncut Gems , and the plot is basically Howard and the Terrible , Horrible , No Good , Very Bad Day . That is n't a shock , considering the film comes from brothers/writers/directors Josh and Benny Safdie , who party-crashed the arthouse scene with 2017 's Good Time -LRB- in which Robert Pattinson was the one playing an asshole having a terrible , horrible , no good , very bad day -RRB- . Uncut Gems is larger in scope , but like Good Time , it has a moral vacuum at its center -- it takes place in the no-man 's - land where society 's walls crumble , and where those who look out only for themselves can best navigate the rubble . The Safdies are n't interested in morality tales but amorality tales , and their stories ' no-holds-barred recklessness , at first freeing , steadily grows exhausting . Thankfully , the Safdies also know how to shoot , cut , and score like nobody else . There 's a twitchy , addictive energy to Uncut Gems , and the Safdies ' choppy , rapid-fire cuts coalesce into a surreal , exhilarating landscape of prismatic hues , blaring fluorescents , and sharp LEDs , all while the analog synth score by Daniel Lopatin -LRB- AKA Oneohtrix Point Never -RRB- adds to the lurid beauty .

'' Instead , he wakes up in the same spot , finds his world has been turned upside down , and must retrace his steps from the night before in order to figure out what happened . There 's nothing really fresh in the premise , but throw in some existential ideas about karma and time , then add in some high-quality hallucinogenic camerawork , vibrant visuals , rotoscope animation , believable -LRB- and occasionally clever -RRB- dialogue , and a few over-the-top characters , and you 've got yourself an entertaining 87 minutes . LEILANI POLK Grand Illusion Friday -- Sunday Audiences seem to love director Makoto Shinkai -LRB- Your Name -RRB- and his approach of pairing an original plot with standard anime emotional blocking : boy meets girl , girl has weather powers , boy and girl reach for each another 's arms in climactic moments , a character runs until they are exhausted and then they keep running , and also someone must die .

The world continues , changed . SUZETTE SMITH Regal Meridian 16 & Thornton Place Many of the reviews of the brilliant documentary When Lambs Become Lions -- about elephant poaching in modern-day Kenya -- will claim that the director , John Kasbe , does not take sides on the issue . The director hunts elephants with the poachers , and he patrols the park with the armed game rangers . The poachers do n't give a fuck about the elephants . They are poor , and they need the money . The rangers also need money , as they have not been paid in ages by the government . And it is here that the director takes a clear side , his film clearly denounces the extreme poverty that both the poachers and the rangers face . If the poachers stop killing elephants , then the rangers will lose their jobs . Therefore , we have the poachers exploiting the elephants , and the rangers exploiting the poachers . The problem then is not the poaching ; it is , of course , capitalism .

The Rev. Jaime Marin-Cardona turned himself in on Jan. 3 , after a warrant was issued for his arrest late last year . The Dec. 22 warrant charged him with three counts of fourth-degree sexual assault , three counts of risk of injury to child and three counts of illegal sexual contact . One of the victims , identified only as John Doe 1 in court documents , told police that when he was 12-years-old , Marin-Cardona `` reached over and rubbed '' his hand on the boy 's penis over his clothing while he was pouring the boy a cup of water before mass , according to the arrest warrant . The victim told police Marin-Cardona apologized and said he `` did n't mean to do that . '' The 51-year-old priest became friends with the boy 's mother during her divorce and visited her home regularly , according to the warrant . He eventually became the victim 's Godfather . Marin-Cardona served as a priest at Our Lady of Guadalupe between 2014 and 2017 before transferring to St. Mary church in Bridgeport , according to Diocese of Bridgeport records . He also previously worked at St. Joseph church in Norwalk from his ordination in 2010 to 2014 . Brian Wallace , spokesman for the Diocese of Bridgeport , said Marin-Cardona was transferred because two churches in Bridgeport needed a Spanish-speaking priest . `` That was the primary reason he was moved , '' Wallace said . Police learned of the abuse after investigators were contacted about Marin-Cardona by the Diocese in September . An official there told police they had received a report of `` boundary violations '' and `` possible ` grooming ''' of two children by the priest , the warrant said . Both boys were interviewed by Family and Children 's Aid in October , but neither said Marin-Cardona had sexually abused them . But in an interview with police days later , Marin-Cardona admitted to touching the older boy on his penis , and told detectives he touched the younger boy on his butt once while he was sitting with the boy on the couch while his mother was making coffee . The younger boy 's mother told authorities Marin-Cardona `` became very controlling and aggressive '' when he messaged her , and felt that he only wanted to be around when her son was at home . Marin-Cardona told her he wanted her son to attend `` private lessons '' when he started his confirmation classes because he was `` special . '' He also asked to be the boy 's Godfather , even after the mother refused to allow it . The church investigated Marin-Cardona and found no abuse allegations in 2015 . He was also re-trained on church policies , as is normal practice when someone commits what the church calls a `` boundary violation . '' Parents are also taught how to spot signs of abuse in these cases . `` It 's not like it 's swept under the carpet or we do n't take it seriously , '' Wallace said . During another interview after Marin-Cardona admitted to the abuse , the older boy told investigators on other occasions Marin Cardona tried to touch him while they were playing soccer , the warrant said . He told police the priest once asked him if he ever masturbated during confession . When the boy was 16-years-old , his mother went to his school to pick him up , and filed a missing person 's report after she could n't locate him , according to the warrant . After the boy arrived home a short while later , his mother eventually learned he had been picked up from school by Marin-Cardona . The boy later told investigators he had gone to Dunkin Donuts with the priest , and while they were in his car , Marin-Cardona reached over and touched his thigh and started to `` slide his hand up . '' When the boy 's mother called Marin-Cardona to find out where her son was , he lied and told her he did n't know , the affidavit said . Around the same time , the boy told investigators , the priest would secretly give him Juul pods - e-cigarette pods - hiding them in the family 's mailbox where the boy would find them after school . The older boy 's mother forbid him to have further contact with Marin-Cardona , and sent him to live with relatives out of state . In his first interview , the older boy told investigators that he had remained in contact with the priest , despite his mother sending him to live with relatives out of state after the incident at Dunkin Donuts , the warrant said . The boy said Marin-Cardona had been sending him money through the mail . Wallace called the church 's safe environment 's program one of the most `` vigilant '' in the country , noting the policies worked in this situation . It was the diocese that alerted police and the Department of Children and Families to the issue . `` This is a pretty good example of being attuned to things , '' Wallace said . `` We investigate everything . '' Marin-Cardona continues to be on administrative leave , which is a fairly permanent status that means he can not act as a priest . `` When the bishop issues an administration leave , I 'm not aware that any of them have ever been reversed , '' Wallace said . But the bishop is likely to laicize Marin-Cardona . `` The laicization process , if in fact that 's what diocese moves ahead with , I think would be fairly prompt , '' Wallace said .", "url": "https://www.ctinsider.com/policereports/newstimes/article/Warrant-Danbury-priest-groomed-and-abused-two-14981216.php", "kws": ["DANBURY", "the^^boy", "St.^^Joseph^^church", "arrest^^warrant", "St.^^Mary^^church", "police^^Marin-Cardona", "police", "Guadalupe^^church", "sexual^^assault", "detectives", "fourth-degree^^sexual^^assault", "investigators", "Bridgeport^^records", "Family", "confession", "police^^days", "Parents", "relatives", "court^^documents", "illegal^^sexual^^contact"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Society": 0.9870978593826294}, "second_cat": {"Society_Other": 0.9870978593826294}}}
0.0	{"docid": "0Nrj1C2U", "title": "5 green tips for eco-friendly surfers", "content": "As surfers , we are constantly surrounded by marine and coastal environments , and it 's hard not to notice when the beaches are strewn with trash , or plastic bottles are riding the waves alongside you . Being attuned with the rolling waves and the stunning landscapes means surfing lends itself naturally to environmentalism . There are plenty of ways a surfer can increase the sustainability of their sport and reduce their impact on the water and beach environments they so frequently inhabit . Engage in Beach Cleanups Whether riding waves or waxing boards , surfers can typically be found near a beach and are therefore some of the first to see the detrimental effects that leaving trash and plastic have on the coastal environment . To help reduce the ugly and damaging presence of waste , surfers should be prepared to pick up trash found on the beach - even if they are n't directly responsible for it . To take it a step further , surfers could join or organize a beach cleanup to make a more impactful difference on the quality of a sand strip . A large amount of trash left on beaches consists of plastic and cigarette butts . Although individual pieces may be small , they are full of chemicals and toxins which pollute the oceans and can cause serious harm to wildlife . Choose the Right Surfboard Typically , surfboards are currently made from fiberglass or epoxy . Unfortunately , neither of these are materials are particularly good for the environment . Fiberglass boards are made with polyester resin and polyurethane foam , which means hazardous chemicals like styrene and volatile organic compounds -LRB- VOCs -RRB- are released during manufacturing and production , resulting in a large carbon footprint . To further the damage , these boards are not biodegradable and not recyclable , and the toxic chemicals they 're made from will end up sitting in a landfill . The market for more environmentally friendly surfboards is growing quickly , and surfers can now get their hands on high-quality boards made from organic materials like wood , bamboo , cork , and paulownia . Not only are these boards great for the planet , but they have the potential to last longer than traditional boards . An alternative and slightly cheaper option is opting to buy second-hand boards or make an effort to look after their board and prolong its life - keeping it on the waves and out of landfills . Buy a Planet-Friendly Wetsuit The wetsuits that are commonly sold on the market today are made from neoprene , a non-biodegradable product of mined limestone or drilled petroleum . Fortunately , there are plenty of innovative companies selling environmentally-friendly wetsuits made of neoprene alternatives . Most alternatives consist of plant-based , organic , and chlorine-free rubbers such as NaturalPrene or Yulex . Another option makes use of recycled plastic bottles to create a water-repellent lining along with a water-based , solvent-free lamination glue . These wetsuits are high-quality and good for Mother Earth but , like a lot of new eco-friendly products making their way onto the market , they are expensive . Surfers can help grow the market , which will eventually bring down costs by investing in a `` green '' wetsuit if they have the means and washing it frequently to keep it for longer . Use Alternative Surf Wax Surf wax is predominantly made up of dangerous petrochemicals which are made by refining petroleum and other fossil fuels . The toxic chemicals end up in the water , on the beach , or in a landfill where they cause massive harm by polluting the ocean , affecting marine ecosystems and damaging reefs . There are some easy and cost-efficient , environmentally-friendly alternatives to surf wax that every surfer should make an effort to use . New organic alternatives use natural ingredients such as beeswax and other biodegradable materials . There are also online guides on how surfers can make their own surf wax . The method is straightforward , but some practice might be needed to find a wax recipe that works for you . Adopt Reef-Friendly Sunscreens Choosing eco-friendly sunscreen is important for everyone under the sun and not just surfers . Sunscreen contains harmful chemicals such as oxybenzone and octinoxate that are dangerous to marine and beach wildlife and also to coral reefs . Naturally , sunscreen tends to wash off , which means the chemicals are dissolved into the water . Surfers should definitely always be protecting themselves from the sun by wearing sunscreen but should try and choose an environmentally-friendly alternative by checking labels and avoiding creams and sprays that use harmful chemicals . There are also a number of sunscreen brands that are bringing out some organic and marine-friendly solutions onto the market . In conclusion : across the world , surfers have a special responsibility to start caring for their local and global environments .", "url": "https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/five-green-tips-for-eco-friendly-surfers", "kws": ["surfers", "beaches", "surfing", "surf^^wax", "environmentally-friendly^^wetsuits", "surfboards", "recycled^^plastic^^bottles", "waves", "Beach^^Cleanups", "natural^^ingredients", "green", "sunscreen^^brands", "coastal^^environments", "organic^^materials", "plastic^^bottles", "online^^guides", "coral^^reefs", "neoprene^^alternatives", "innovative^^companies", "trash"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Lifestyle": 0.9329563975334167}, "second_cat": {"Lifestyle_Other": 0.9329563975334167}}}

His work , by his own admission , has contributed to the hyper-partisan , zero-sum political world that we live in today . But that was all B.T. , or `` Before Trump . '' Wilson is now using his mastery of the dark arts of politics to defeat the leader of the very party he helped build , as laid out in his new book , `` Running Against the Devil : A Plot to Save America from Trump -- and Democrats from Themselves . '' This article was originally published at Salon Wilson 's previous book , `` Everything Trump Touches Dies , '' reached No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list in 2018 . He recently visited Salon 's New York studio to shared his blunt , practical approach to beating Trump . His book is not about ideology , he emphasized , It 's about how to defeat the racist , sexist , grifter who threatens the future of our nation . It 's truly that simple . Forget policy papers and wonky policy discussions , Wilson says . To beat Trump , make the entire election about his corruption , sexism , cruelty and bigotry . Wilson believes that if the 2020 election is framed as a choice between four more years of toxic Trump or another person -- virtually any person -- Americans will pick the non-Trump on the ballot . He advises Democrats to `` forget national polls '' and focus on winning the Electoral College , not the popular vote -- meaning , essentially , that they must ignore the deep blue states on the coasts and put all available resources into winning key swing states like Wisconsin , Pennsylvania , Michigan and Ohio . Whether Wilson 's `` tough love '' approach -LRB- as he puts it -RRB- encourages you or enrages you , watch our Salon Talks episode or read a transcript of our conversation below , edited as usual for clarity and length . I have to say with all sincerity , `` Running Against the Devil '' is a must-read book for progressives , moderates , anyone who wants a roadmap to defeat Donald Trump . If that 's your focus , this is the book you have to read . That 's my focus . And the book is n't about ideology . It is n't about policy . It is about a practical , political approach to beating Donald Trump , which I think people on the left , the center , and the few of us on the right who held onto a shred of our principles believe is vital . Was the Republican Party just looking for the white supremacist savior like Trump ? Were they primed for this ? Or did he really change the party ? You know , it was like a bunch of black swans landed at one time . You have the confluence of reality TV , of Fox News , of Donald Trump with celebrity culture , of a field of Republicans who -- none of them were superstars at the end of the day , no matter how much we wanted them to be . You had Hillary Clinton as the -LSB- Democratic -RSB- nominee , who had this 30-year pre-existing condition where the Republicans had turned her into Satan incarnate with their voters . So this moment happened , and Donald Trump 's moral failings and his racism and everything else about this guy led a party that had been told for years , the only thing you 're missing is somebody who will blow up everything . You just want to destroy everything . I mean , it 's the Joker candidacy . And they got it . Right now there are three categories of Republicans . A fairly small fraction of them , like a third maybe , really believe in this crap . Really believe that Trumpism is the new way . They treat him as a king . A third of the Republicans are terrified of the guy . They are so scared of a tweet that they hide under their covers every day . And a third of them are like opportunists . They want the judges , they want the regulations for their donors , that sort of crap . The confluence of all those things that came together at one moment gave us this terrible , terrible thing . And look , all of us who worked in the party for a long time , we recognized there were different fractions and factions in the party . I 've never been a social conservative , I 'm not an evangelical . Everybody has given up in the Republican Party of today . All of those predicates . They do n't believe in anything . They believe in Trump , whether they believe in his terror over them or their love of him . It leads to a personality cult , not a political party . As you worked as a political consultant doing the dark arts -- and we talked about that with your first book -- you , on some level , contributed to the hyper-partisan climate . Sure . This monster that you built , in a way , found the living manifestation that could lead it . Yeah , unfortunately , there was always a dynamic pressure inside the party . The fiscal people and the individual liberty people would keep the social conservatives from getting too out of control . The social conservatives would keep the fiscal people from getting too out of control . The foreign policy people , this tripartite internal , the three-legged stool they used to call it . Well with Trump , that all fell apart . It 's all gone . It 's all id . It 's everything that 's in their heads . They 're told , `` You can have whatever you want , we 're going to burn it all down . '' And that 's what they 're doing . Are you still a Republican ? I 'm done . You 're out of the party ? Look , I have n't changed my voter registration yet , mainly because I want to vote against the son of a bitch twice . But I 'm not a Republican in any political sense anymore . Is the party gone ? Yeah , the party 's dead . The party 's gone . I do n't see any pathway for it to come back . There is nobody in this party who feels a need for reconciliation . They do n't want to face their truth . Calling me a former Republican is accurate in every meaningful way , but nobody in the party wants to look at what 's been created . They do n't want to look at the expansion of government , the expansion of debt , the expansion of executive power , the expansion of mainstream abuse of people . All those things are repugnant to a conservative . I 'm not doing the `` no true Scotsman . '' I 'm doing the actual heart of Burkean conservatism , which is individual liberty and respect and dignity should be part of what you believe in . This guy is the antithesis of all that . He 's breeding a generation of people who believe abuse is beneficial . Cruelty is his currency and he enjoys it . To me , one of his greatest sins is misleading otherwise good Americans to believe in this . Sure , I think that 's a good point . And be vicious and mean and be sexist and racist . So look , is it naive for people who oppose Trump to go , `` Well , there 's people like you peeling off and other Republicans , so there 's no future for this GOP . '' Is it naive ? Or are there enough younger people who will come in and embrace this white supremacy , racism , sexism , whatever you want to call it , to fuel this party to go forward to win ? I am hopeful that there 's a space in this country , eventually , for a party that is dedicated to individual liberty and constitutional adherence and limited government . But it 's like St. Augustine , `` Lord , make me good , but not yet . '' We 're going to have to burn down this thing first . And the Trump version of the Republican Party has to go . I 'm willing to make sacrifices as a guy who believes in individual liberty in the Constitution . I 'm willing to make sacrifices in the short term and do things that maybe are n't my ideological cup of tea in order to ensure that this country , as an experiment , survives . Because what 's the alternative ? We 're going to slip into an authoritarian nationalism . You know , the reason he 's able to activate some of this , Dean , is that there is a set of human cognitive behaviors that likes having someone say , `` Your fear is OK . Your hate is OK . Your anxiety about brown people coming from Mexico is OK . '' And it 's not OK , but it 's there and he 's a master of demagoguery . He 's a master at propaganda . And so a few of us with , like , the Liam Neeson special set of skills -- there may not be many of us , but we 're pretty good in a scrap . Let 's focus now on the thesis of your book , which is defeating Donald Trump . Let 's take everyone through a few of the themes . One is make this election a referendum on Donald Trump . Explain how you do that . First off , every re-election is a referendum on the incumbent . You 're asking a simple question , `` Do you want this guy , who does these things , for four more years ? '' When Barack Obama was the incumbent , we had a high hill to climb because most people were pretty content with Barack Obama . In 2004 , most people felt pretty safe , relatively speaking , with George W. Bush . That 's why they made those election decisions . Bill Clinton , same story . My old boss , George Bush 41 , you know what ? He did great ending the Cold War . He did great getting Saddam out of Kuwait . On the economy , not so much . And people made a decision , we want a different thing . So all presidential re-elections are a referendum on the incumbent . People have a great opportunity here . You can choose cruelty and corruption or you can choose something else . And something else , it almost does n't matter what the alternative is , as long as it 's not another flavor of evil . If the Democrats do n't make it a referendum on Trump , they will try to make it a referendum on policy . And policy in the hands of the Republicans ... I helped build this machine . I helped do this a long time . Lord , give me a Democratic policy briefing book because I will make a hundred ads out of it . They will be demagogic . They will be terrifying . They will be lies piled upon lies . But the fundamental thing is that they will scare the crap out of the voters I want to scare the crap out of . When you give a 600-page policy document , like Elizabeth Warren did , on her health care plan , whatever its merits , I will find one of my research nerds , who will go through that book line by line , because I 'll never read it . They 'll find three or four things so I can go out and say , `` Union members , your health care will be taken away from you under Elizabeth Warren 's plan . '' Policy is deadly . Policy is a fallacy . Like the Green New Deal . I remember how that went through . Planes are gone , cows will be slaughtered . Right , you ca n't fly on airplanes . You ca n't eat meat . When we look back at 2016 , so many people said , `` Well , the campaign about Hillary was anti-Trump , anti-Trump , without an affirmative message . '' And that 's unfair . But that 's a summary for certain people . In a re-election campaign though , that 's not a bad strategy , you 're saying ? Right , because it is a referendum . There is a four-year baseline now -- you know how Trump behaves . And I will also argue that Hillary Clinton did n't particularly run an effective countervailing campaign to Trump . She played defense constantly in that campaign . In part , because the Republicans had her pinned down in a quasi-impeachment scenario with Benghazi for the first half of her campaign . And then Bernie kind of bled her through the summer . James Comey after that . You make a great point in your book about getting the Democratic base out . I 'm not going to curse , but you write , `` Democrats f**king hate Trump . '' Yeah . I 'm sure Republicans hated Hillary and Obama . You 're a Republican , so I do n't know if you 'll deny this , but hate is part of the currency the GOP used to animate their base . Sure . I 'm seeing hate among Democrats for Trump -- and not even Democrats , women who are not active in politics . Even centrist Republicans in Massachusetts who liked Romney , hate Trump . They will crawl over broken glass to vote against this guy . This is why ideological perfection is the enemy of victory in this . You might not get every single thing you want , but my gosh , if you 've got a group of Democrats , right , who say , `` We wo n't turn our people out unless you 're going to do X or Y for us . '' Or , `` We wo n't turn our people out unless you name our person as the nominee . '' They 're not really your people . Democrats have proven to us in \u201918 and in the off-year elections , they will come out and vote against this guy and his enablers in droves . They will come out with passion . That 's the easy part . This election has a built in turnout mechanism that 's Donald Trump . As we 're talking , there 's a debate about to happen in Iowa , the last before the Iowa caucus on Feb. 3 . If you were advising Democrats as a group , what would you tell them their message should be tonight in trying to not just win the primary , but defeat Donald Trump ? That 's the key message . You 've got to tell Democratic voters , as the nominee , `` I am the best person to defeat Trump . I can go toe-to-toe with Trump . I can be on the debate stage , I can look him in the eye , I can punch him in the mouth . I will take this motherf ** ker down . '' That 's what Democratic voters are looking for . They want to see some fight in the dog , as they say down South . They want to see somebody who is going to be a scrapper , a fighter , somebody who is passionate and who can articulate the case against Donald Trump and his corruption and his cruelty and his insanity and his unsuitability for this office and the way he demeans this country around the world and at home . They want to see somebody who can do that . Somebody who is absolutely going to be the fighter against Trump . They 're not sitting there going , `` Well , I looked at page 611 of the health care plan for Biden . And then Elizabeth Warren 's on 435 . '' They 're not scoring on policy . They 're looking for the fighter . Performance matters and debates matter . Hillary Clinton was a very smart , considered , professional sort of politician . She got on stage with Trump and he did this whole monkey act , walked around behind her , mugged , made faces and leaned over her . She did n't understand how to handle that . So you want to see somebody with the physical presence too , who feels like they 're going to have an ability to post up against this guy on that debate stage . Because that 's going to be the big show . That 's the reality TV final contest . So should the Democrats , instead of fighting over the nuances of Medicare for All , be slamming Trump on , say , his lie where he said `` I 'm the one that saved coverage for preexisting health conditions . '' In unison going , `` Democrats gave you that . We 're the ones saving it and you want to get rid of it with legislation . John McCain saved it . Now you 're in the courts trying to get rid of it . '' There is no bigger gaslighting on the domestic side that I think I 've seen from Trump . I mean , you can make the case that the economy has been juiced along by tax cuts and by wild deficit spending and that the economy is strong . You can make that case . And you could pick it apart a little bit too , but you can not make a case that Trump did not enthusiastically embrace the bill that came out of the House in 2017 . And they led with the dumbest political move of all time , which is to eliminate pre-existing conditions . Because I have polled this matter extensively , since 2009 . I 've done dozens of focus groups about this . Voters , Republican , Democrat , black , white , liberal , conservative , Catholic , Jewish , every single voter group in this country hates the fact that pre-existing condition coverage could be taken away . They are terrified of it . Leading with Donald Trump , being somebody who says he 's going to stand for you and then screws you over , that iterates across the trade war with farmers in Iowa and Wisconsin and Michigan . That iterates across steelworkers in Ohio and Pennsylvania , coal miners who he promised all these new jobs to . This guy is a lying liar who lies , and they need to call it out . Remember he promised , `` Oh we 're going to have a great new health care plan . It 's going to cover everybody . It 's going to be free . And there 'll be all the pre-existing coverage . '' There 's never been any such thing proposed . So the fact that he lies like a cheap rug iterates across all these different areas and it iterates across the corruption that voters believe he represents . So , it 's a good opportunity . And that 's a way to say it : `` I 'm going to go up on the debate stage against Donald Trump and I 'm going to tear his hide off on the following big lies . '' And pre-existing should be one of them . It obviously troubles Trump because Bloomberg 's ads are focused on that . That 's the thing that inspired the tweet yesterday , `` I saved pre-existing conditions . '' Not only did n't they save them , but after their vote , they put all the Republicans in a bus and took them to the Rose Garden to have a party to celebrate the end of pre-existing medical conditions . And they 've also been litigating it . The Department of Justice , with all the power of the Department of Justice , is litigating to eliminate pre-existing conditions . In the book you also talk about another key issue , the economy . Democrats are almost silent . Now , you 've got Bernie Sanders and Liz Warren talking about how it can be better . I thought one of the big rules in politics is that you go after your opponent 's strength and that 's his strength is the economy . Should they be prosecuting that more ? We just had the jobs report last week . It 's the lowest job growth in eight years , we 're sliding . We 're sliding . It 's weakening . There is a recession coming and there 's a bill going to come due . And look , I 'm a free market guy , but I thought the tax bill was an egregious crony capitalist giveaway . I know the lobbyist who wrote the tax bill . I know who they work for . They work for a bunch of guys down on Wall Street for hedge funds and big banks . And they were specifically engineering this thing to juice Wall Street . A lot of these people out there in the country , the only thing they sort of understand is job or no job . And they hear on the news the market 's up , market 's down , and that 's the big signifier . They 're hearing market up . Well the market 's up because the Fed is still juicing money into the system . The market 's up because this tax bill was an enormous benefit , a $ 2 trillion benefit to Wall Street and the hedge fund guys . So , as a free market guy , I 'm like , `` How is this the market at work ? '' This is the president juicing the system . It 's just like the trade stuff . We 're having enormous economic damage on the trade war , which is actually where I think the Democrats have their strongest economic message . Because remember , we 've got a few swing states to fight this battle with . Pennsylvania , Ohio , Wisconsin , Michigan , those are states that have been screwed in the trade war . And it has n't been fixed . There is no deal with China yet . USMCA is not all that and a bag of chips . This thing is a broken set of economic promises and they have an opportunity to fight on that . I would n't try to fight on `` the stock market 's not up as much this or that percentage . '' Voters do n't really do bank shots . They do A to B , not A to Z . If you were advising on the economy to these Democrats , what would you recommend ? First off , I would talk about the stories of real people in the swing states . `` I 'm farmer X , I am a soybean farmer in Iowa . Donald Trump said that this trade war was going to help me . My farm is in foreclosure now . '' And we do have record farm foreclosures in Wisconsin and Iowa right now . `` I 'm a steelworker in Pennsylvania . Donald Trump promised his trade war was going to help me . Instead , our plant is closed . '' There have been no new steel plants built . He promised this . This is the reality . Tell real stories of real people . You talk about people who are still living in a world where household debt is at record levels . Home values are kind of flat right now . People are starting to feel that 2007 , 2008 feeling in the wind , that we still have n't solved the problem of college loan debt . In fact , this administration is making it much more difficult . There is no Bernie magic wand . You 're not going to wash away $ 2 trillion of debt tomorrow . But there are ways to adjust this so that the country has a system that 's more market-driven and less punitive . And that affects middle-class families less . There are a lot of ways to get to this . Real stories from real people . So you 're saying those are better than statistics and numbers , which Democrats love to talk about . Yeah , this is from a long time ago . There 's a classic editorial cartoon from 1984 where Walter Mondale has this blackboard full of statistics and formulas and charts and Ronald Reagan has a smiley face on his blackboard . That 's what voters get . That 's what they understand . You 're not a fan of Bernie Sanders in your book . You like Liz Warren more . What does it matter if it 's Bernie or Joe Biden or Buttigieg ? Well , I think Warren or Biden or Buttigieg are all viable candidates . Bernie Sanders is Donald Trump election insurance . I honestly believe it . Why ? He 's 300 years old . He just had a heart attack . He is every clich\u00e9 ever , in the history of the free shit movement . Republicans will turn Bernie into the worst caricature you 've ever seen . He is the scary old socialist figure of their nightmares . But in this case , it 's not fake . He 's actually that guy . He 's got an unbelievably thick oppo file . They 're salivating over this guy . I still talk to guys in the mafia , in the Republican mafia . They 're working their hardest to make sure Bernie 's the nominee . They want Bernie to be the nominee . Bernie will lose every single state south of the Mason Dixon Line . No questions asked , including Florida , which you ca n't lose Florida . What do you say about the people who were torn between Bernie and Trump in the 2016 primaries . Then when Bernie did n't get nomination , they went to Trump . At first , I did n't understand it , then I talked to them . Trump was talking about jobs , that NAFTA was n't good , that the rich are getting richer , the system is rigged and he was addressing that very issue . There 's a horseshoe of populism . And the left and right tines become very close together a lot of the time . The problem with the Bernie analysis is that when you go out -- and I go through this in the book , this is a secret that the Republicans have kept pretty quiet for a long time . Most Democrats out in the country , outside of the coasts , are not hard , hard progressives . They 're not socialists . They 're not burn-it-all-down guys . Most Democrats out in the country are pretty moderate . We 've studied this for years and years and years . We 've drilled into this thing over and over again . We 've identified male and female Democratic voters in the suburbs who are mostly moderate . They 're not hard progressives . They 're JFK-style Democrats . They 're Bill Clinton-style Democrats . They 're Barack Obama Democrats . As much as Republicans tried to make Barack Obama into this wild-eyed , leftist , socialist , communist sleeper agent . Barack Obama basically ran as a liberal suburban Republican . He was not scary to people and we knew it . That 's when we tried to turn him into this figure . We could never get there . But if you want to go and put Bernie at the top of the ticket ... I 'm getting like five billion tweets already about Bernie , so , why not make my life more of a living hell ? But Bernie is going to be absolutely the perfect foil for Donald Trump : `` I 'm bad , but this guy is Castro from Vermont . '' Even if Joe Biden gets the nomination , Trump 's going to call him a socialist . We know that . But it 's not true . Right , so are you saying there 's more potential traction and resonance with Bernie as a candidate than it would be for Biden because people know Biden ? First off , Bernie is not a Democrat . He 's got a party that he wants to use as a host vector into the nomination . Who loves Bernie ? Young voters love Bernie . Yes , they do . Young voters adore Bernie . You know what young voters do n't do ? They do n't vote . Old people vote . You know who really , really votes ? Very old people . You know who really votes in Florida , the No. 1 key swing state ? Really goddamn old people , like people on respirators vote in Florida . They 're old , old , old . And they vote like a champ . And that is not their demo . They tend to like Warren or Biden a little more . But , look , nobody 's perfect . To quote , Donald Rumsfeld , `` You go to war with the army you have , not the one you want . '' None of these guys are perfect . And there 's no generational superstar in this field . There 's no Barack Obama or Bill Clinton or JFK in this field . There 's such a debate in my head , I can hear it from my fellow progressives who will be saying , `` Well , Bernie 's going to get people out . '' Your argument to win is that you do n't need a Bernie . You do n't need the machine to get people out . They 're going to come out because of Trump on the other side . Right , Trump 's going to get them out for you . So , if it 's Joe Biden , a more centrist , you think it 's not a problem for turnout for Democrats ? I do n't think it 's a problem for turnout . And here 's the thing : Again , if somebody tells you , `` I wo n't turn out versus Donald Trump , because I did n't get who I wanted , '' fuck them . They 're not on your team . They 're in this for their own narrow interest . This is a country over party thing . And a country over ideological preference thing , or at least it should be in my opinion . If you 're in any community that Donald Trump has demonized or enacted policies that discriminated against , this is very personal . This is n't political . It is a referendum on this guy who 's a monster . Last thing , you make a great point to focus on the Electoral College and key swing states . Absolutely . Not national polls . Why is it the key ? Stay away from national polls . They are always an illusion . They will always trick you into stupid political behavior . Focus on the key states . As much as progressives hate the Electoral College -- and we can argue its flaws all day long -- in 2020 , the Electoral College is the only game in town . There 's not going to be some miracle where it 's not the rule book . The winner of the Electoral College is president . Does n't matter how many popular votes you get . We 're talking about maybe 15 states . Realistically , six or seven of those states are going to be competitive , but you want to play a little chess . You can roll up a victory here or there if you offset somewhere else . Those states are the only thing that matters . You 've got to be following the polls in those states . And you 've got to be rigorous in your approach to polling on this . I mean , look , the polls in \u201916 were not wrong . On a national level they were n't . They were not wrong , OK , but in the swing states , the Clinton people took their foot off the gas because they were watching the national polls . Donald Trump is an idiot and a moron and just a kook of the first order , but he is surrounded by a bunch of guys like me , who are ride-or-die for him . They do n't love him ideologically , but they 're stuck . And they 're very smart . And they 're very determined and they will do anything to win . And they will fight this in the swing states . They 're not going to spend a dollar in Mississippi . They know how Mississippi is going to go . In your book , you outline two scenarios for election night in November . The upbeat one and the horrific downtrodden one where many of us are looking at Canada , Mexico , whatever countries to live in . If you 're giving one piece of advice to people , regardless of left , right , or center who want Nov. 3 to be a happy night and the defeat of Donald Trump , what 's that one piece of advice ? Bust your ass in the swing states . That 's it . You got to go in the swing states . You 've got to spend every dime there . You got to put the boots on the ground there . I do n't care if you have one volunteer in California . We know how California is going to vote . Everybody in California wants to support the nominee . Go to Michigan , go to Wisconsin , go to Pennsylvania , go to Ohio , go to Florida , go to North Carolina , go to Arizona . Get to work on the ground . Voter contact still matters more than almost any other thing . A knock on the door , a phone call , a personal outreach on social media . That matters more than almost anything else you can do . And fighting this battle in those swing states is vital .", "url": "https://www.rawstory.com/2020/01/former-republican-political-wizard-outlines-the-key-to-defeating-trump-and-his-personality-cult/", "kws": ["Republican", "politics", "versus^^Donald^^Trump", "Trump", "politician", "hate^^Trump", "personality", "beating^^Trump", "ideology", "Democratic^^voters", "stupid^^political^^behavior", "ideological^^perfection", "Barack^^Obama^^Democrats", "Hillary^^Clinton", "evil", "populism", "ideological^^preference^^thing", "Donald^^Rumsfeld", "Bernie^^Sanders", "Burkean^^conservatism"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"PoliticsGovernment_Federal": 1.0000100135803223}}}

0.0	{"docid": "0Nrl5dXF", "title": "When Love Comes to Town : Martin Luther King in Harlem", "content": "The Coming of a King : A Charismatic Moment June 22 , 1967 Everyone was waiting for the Lord . Martin Luther was coming to the meeting and nobody was about to miss him . A Negro woman who looked like she spent her life getting stuck behind the fried chicken platter at the church social and doing the dirty work for the block party was having none of that nonsense Wednesday . The red rose on her crocheted hat vibrated with her determination . She informed the person beckoning her to sit at the card table and check names that she had come to hear Reverend King , and then walked on by . She passed through a door decorated with leaning men . The huge man who was acting as bouncer-in-reverse had been unsuccessful in getting the men to come in and sit down . Despite his frantic signaling that seats were available , none of them wanted to give up the chance to be the first to see the coming of the Lord . On the wooden chairs set up around the room , women in $ 2 house dresses and beads were turned at a 30-degree angle to watch the door . Using programs folded accordion style instead of pastel fans with pictures of Christ , they managed to turn the chandelier ballroom of the Hotel Roosevelt into a Baptist Church . Not all the faces were black , some were Puerto Rican . Few were white . Emptying bedpans is not a high-priority white job . And all the people in the room were hospital workers . The official reason for the gathering of the 800 was a meeting of delegates of Local 1199 of the Drug and National Employees Union . In between taking turns checking the hall to see if the Reverend had arrived , they busied themselves with union business and watched a documentary in which they starred . The film was greeted with the jokes and applause of a home movie . Only home in this case was Harlem . Mrs. Cameron , the movie queen for the day , strolled past bars on 127th Street , past roach-crawling rat-infested tenements , past gutters filled with garbage and vomit , and explained how the union had improved her life . Mrs. Cameron was n't the only star . A black Santa and Robert Kennedy were greeted with great enthusiasm both in the film and by the audience . Santa won his supporters by being black and by giving out presents . Kennedy , as usual , did n't have to do anything to wrap up the vote . The Lord appeared for the first time -- on film . There was a great burst of applause . The applause was just as loud , but accompanied by laughter , when Malcolm-in-shades flashed onto the screen . The difference was not in affection , but in conception . King is the father you depend on and try to live up to . Malcolm is the brother you pound on the back and take to a crap game around the corner . At a point between flashes of union members singing `` Go Tell It on the Mountain '' and shots of their demonstrating with the Southern Leadership Conference , the men standing in the doorway made a dash for the outer corridor . He was there . The image had been made flesh . By the time the men reached the corridor , the reporters who had been perching like vultures on the mezzanine railing had already begun to circle the Reverend Martin Luther King with their microphones . They were hard at work doing the job they do best -- playing one black group off against another . `` How come , Dr. King , '' one of the newsmen asked , `` the black nationalists were n't invited to the unity meeting that set Cleveland up as the target city for the summer ? '' `` The meeting was for civil rights organizations , '' Dr. King said . Then , healing the situation , he added , `` That does not mean we wo n't work with the nationalists and the Muslims in Cleveland . We have already met with them and have a fine relationship . '' `` Muhammed did n't come to the mountain ? '' the newsman asked , still trying to bait him . `` No , not this time , '' King replied . Not even bad jokes ruffled his calm . At this point , King 's disciples began hustling him toward a private room . He was almost invisible in the center of the group . People seeing him for the first time standing among others were surprised that the Lord was such a little man . Once word was out that he had reached the hall , no one even pretended to watch the film . There was a sense of great excitement , but muted . And when the door opened , and he came through , a great rush of people jumped to their feet clapping away . The `` Hallelujah Chorus '' would have been appropriate to the mood of the moment as would `` Lord , Hold My Hand While I Run This Race . '' He made his way with imposing solemnity to the center of the stage . The deep voice rolled out over the assembly . Its familiar cadence soared -- evoking the shared experiences of his people , giving them a sense of identity , restoring for awhile a feeling of wholeness . This was the communion he supplied and they sought . What he said was not important . It was the man who lent weight to the words . It was his presence felt , his integrity sensed . Such a man could make the telephone book seem like the gospel . Still , what he said was n't unimportant . He spoke of the nation 's problems of race and poverty , problems that are gigantic in scale and chaotic in detail . He noted that the friends who were with the Negroes in Selma are with them no longer . He defined black power as the ability to make General Motors and Washington say `` yes '' when they want to say `` no . '' He spoke of the war in the Mideast . He defended Israel 's right to exist and he proposed a Marshall Plan for the Arabs to ease the tension among the have-nots . Then , moving to the heart of his speech , he spoke of Vietnam -- of the unjust war : `` Who appointed this country divine agent to the world ? '' he asked . `` Who gave it the arrogance to try to fix up another country when it has n't put its own house in order ? How can it expect its black soldiers to fight in brutal solidarity with whites in Vietnam and then come home and not be able to live on the same block with them ? ... Come home to Alabama and not even be able to be buried in the same cemetery with them ? '' After every question , the audience responded . It was not just the church ladies : It was the young blacks standing along the aisles . It was the tough young kids who are one step from the street corners of Harlem -- the kids who he had been least able to reach . They were the ones who were applauding the loudest and shouting `` Yes , Sir ! Yes , Sir ! '' when he asked , `` How come this country only worries about Vietnam ? How come it does n't use its power against South Africa or Rhodesia ? '' And they shouted again when he asked , `` How come this mainly white country does n't stop bombing colored people ? '' He stopped the questions . He started to unravel the thread of continuity of his convictions : `` There has been a whole lot of applauding in this country . People and the newspapers applauded me in Montgomery when Negroes were killed and I urged people to be non-violent . They applauded me in Birmingham when Negroes were gassed and I urged people to be non-violent against Bull Connor . They applauded me in Philadelphia after the bodies of the three were found and I urged people to be non-violent against Sheriff Rainey . Yet they damn me now when I urge people to be non-violent against little children in Vietnam . `` Even tonight , a man came up to me and said that my talking against the war had hurt my leadership . He urged me to pull back from my position . `` My answer to him was : ` Sir , I 'm sorry you do n't know me . I 'm not a consensus leader . I do n't determine my position by polls nor by what is safe or politic or popular , but by what is right . As for hurting civil rights by my position , the war has already done more to hurt civil rights than I could ever do by talking against Vietnam . ' `` Despite the dismal picture both in and out of the country , the Lord has not been beaten down , '' he assured them . `` I have not lost faith . We have survived slavery . No war and no backlash is going to turn us around . '' And the people said , `` Amen . '' `` We shall overcome . No lie can live forever . '' And the people said , `` Amen . '' `` We shall overcome .

The Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation raised the question again , how do we decide who to believe when a woman says she was sexually assaulted by someone she knows behind a closed door and the man denies it ? That 's an issue universities have been grappling with . My guest Vanessa Grigoriadis is the author of `` Blurred Lines : Sex , Power And Consent On Campus . '' Over the course of three years , she interviewed 120 students from 20 universities , spoke with nearly 80 administrators and experts and read dozens of case reports . She says that while writing the book , she witnessed a historic moment when survivors moved from the shadows to the spotlight , first on campus , and then nationwide with the #MeToo movement . Grigoriadis is a contributing editor at The New York Times Magazine and Vanity Fair and has won a National Magazine Award . Vanessa Grigoriadis , welcome to FRESH AIR . You know , you write in your book that there 's a new understanding of what rape and sexual assault means that started on college campuses , but with the #MeToo movement , it spread beyond campuses . What did the Kavanaugh hearings and confirmation tell you about how far that new understanding has spread ? I guess what I 'm asking you is this . If the Republican senators in the Judiciary Committee had gone to college campuses , what do you think some of the things are they would 've been told about what to take into consideration before voting - things that they might not have thought of ... VANESSA GRIGORIADIS : Right . GROSS : ... In part because the Republicans on the judiciary were men . A lot of them were older men . If - you know , their college days were very different in terms of thinking about sexual assault . GRIGORIADIS : Yeah . If those senators had been on college campuses as presidents or administrators or Title IX officers , they would 've had a completely different set of questions - right ? - because they would have already known what college campuses know about sexual assault , which is very few women make it up . Very few women are excited to get there and report and feel like this is their moment in the limelight . Something like not having reported for many years is not a big deal . Most sexual assault survivors do n't actually report for a while . And they would know that they might not actually get a lot of evidence because there 's very rarely good evidence in many of these cases , particularly those that happened 36 years ago . So they have to look at the credibility of each person . GROSS : Last Tuesday , while the FBI investigation was still going on into Brett Kavanaugh , President Trump spoke to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House before boarding a flight . This was October 2 . And so this was before the Senate voted on the Kavanaugh nomination for the Supreme Court - before they confirmed him . So this is President Trump . -LRB- SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING -RRB- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Well , I say that it 's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of , which is a very , very - this is a very difficult time . What 's happening here has much more to do than even the appointment of a Supreme Court justice . It really does . You could be somebody that was perfect your entire life , and somebody could accuse you of something - does n't necessarily have to be a woman , as everybody says . But somebody could accuse you of something , and you 're automatically guilty . But in this realm , you are truly guilty until proven innocent . That 's one of the very , very bad things that 's taking place right now . GROSS : President Trump has , you know , kind of made fun of Blasey Ford , and he said that her accusations were a hoax - a Democratic hoax . So this is interpretation here . But what message do you think that is sending women who have been harassed , assaulted or raped ? And I wonder if you 've been talking to students - if you 've gone back to any of the students who you interviewed for your book and asked them about the impact of the Kavanaugh hearings ? GRIGORIADIS : Yeah . I have spoken to students that were in my book , and the survivors are absolutely devastated , horrified by what Trump said . I think that they 've found a lot of the Trump presidency to be , in their word , triggering , and this is certainly part of it . To watch a woman be just cast to the side , just waved away when she went to the Senate - I think that that is their personal worst nightmares - that I would sit there and be publicly humiliated . Remember ; there 's so much shame that a lot of survivors carry about what happened to them . And this historic moment that we 're in is about raising the demons , casting off the shame . You know , it 's a real , like , exorcism for them . So to have it be so publicly that the clock turned back has been extremely upsetting . GROSS : So there 's been two times when the Judiciary Committee and then all of Congress have had to vote about whether the woman who accused the man of sexual harassment or assault was lying or telling the truth and if there is enough evidence to prevent the Supreme Court nominee from becoming confirmed . So there was the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas case and now the Blasey Ford-Brett Kavanaugh case . And in both cases , judiciary and Congress voted for the man and against the woman making the accusations . Let 's look at how colleges handle accusations . You write about how colleges have developed their own system of helping to bring some kind of justice when accusations - when women come forward to accuse a fellow student of sexual assault or rape . They 're not courts per se , but they are some forms of proceedings . Can you give us a couple of examples of colleges that are doing this and how they do it - like what their procedures are ? GRIGORIADIS : Well , all colleges have to be doing it . It 's the rule . You 've got to have a Title IX office , and the Title IX office has to take any claims of sexual assault or misconduct or groping or violent rape very seriously . And they have been since 2011 , when Obama kind of laid down the law and said , I want all of you to pursue this . I want girls to have an equal access to education , and they ca n't if they 're , you know , dealing with trauma from a sexual assault . And that 's totally true and great . Since then , as many people know , universities have had a hard time putting these courts together . Obama 's guidance was good , but he almost did n't tell them enough about what they should do . You know , what do their courts look like ? Who should sit on the court ? He did say that he 'd like everybody to use a standard of the preponderance of the evidence , so it 's more likely than not that the act occurred . It 's so hard to prove so many of these cases that I think a lower standard is appropriate here , although many attorneys do not agree with that . GROSS : So what are these proceedings like ? Do they bring people in who will support their point of view ? Is there an investigation ? How does it work ? GRIGORIADIS : You know , the No. 1 thing to understand is that across the country , all of these courts are different , and they 're different according to whether the university wants to take this super seriously or not and if the university has the funds to take it seriously . So real investigations are happening for sure . Now , universities do n't have subpoena power . So whichever students are going to talk to them , they 'll send a letter to the accused and say , you 're being brought up on this . They 'll , you know , say , OK , well , we 're going to probably have our case in a couple of months , so get everything ready . And , you know , there 's no real system to help the accused in a lot of cases , and the boys rarely call their parents . GROSS : Right . GRIGORIADIS : They 're on their own . They 're at school . They 're afraid . They ask somebody 's , you know , older brother , who sets them up with some attorney who may or may not have an idea of how to actually help this boy . Then there 'll be some sort of proceeding . And you might have a fisheries professor who is the person who 's going to judge your case , or you might have , actually , a former prosecutor . It 's completely random who is going to decide your fate . GROSS : Part of the reason why these college systems have developed to deal with charges of a sexual assault is because President Obama sent out , basically , a letter of guidance , right ? It was n't a law , but it was a letter of guidance about how colleges should go about trying to handle accusations of sexual assault . And this was built on Title IX . And so explain what Title IX is , which was passed as a small part of a larger piece of legislation and signed by President Nixon in 1972 . GRIGORIADIS : So Title IX is just a short law that nobody in a university should be discriminated against on the basis of gender . And I knew it in the '90s as a law that would protect women 's sports , which , of course , it does n't . And this argument about whether Title IX should cover sexual assault has been going on for many years . GROSS : President Trump 's Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is changing the guidelines for sexual assault on campus . And tell us about the changes that she 's making or is on the verge of making . GRIGORIADIS : Betsy DeVos has been very concerned about the due process in campus courts . She has also made it fairly clear that she is aligned with Trump in believing that this is a scarier time for boys . So she is quite concerned about the accused students and thinks that , you know , I mean , you just had - her deputy said it to The New York Times . You know , 90 percent of the cases that they 're seeing involve just regretted sex . So DeVos is concerned about due process , right ? She 's concerned about false accusations . She 's also concerned that Obama imposed these mandates by fiat even though they were guidance . He really did have the Office for Civil Rights try to go to universities and say , open up your books ; I want to see how you 've been deciding these sexual assault cases , and I 'm here now and this is serious . So she 's really backed off of sending the OCR out . But for the students , really , the most important thing is that she may change this definition of sexual assault , which had previously been something kind of vague about unwelcome contact . And , you know , various colleges had interpreted what sexual assault was on their own . And now she 's interested in saying , OK , well , what would count ? It needs to be something that is severe and pervasive enough to deprive a student of education . So what would happen if it was a one-off sexual assault , like Blasey Ford described ? A pawing over clothes , a hand on a mouth , quote-unquote `` nothing happened , '' even though here she is thinking about it years later . GROSS : Well , she was afraid she 'd be smothered to death . GRIGORIADIS : She was afraid that she was going to be killed . GROSS : Unintentionally . Unintentionally smothered to death . GRIGORIADIS : Yeah . GROSS : And she was prevented from leaving . So is Betsy DeVos trying to say Title IX , which mandates against gender discrimination on campus , needs to be applied to discrimination against men because so many men are being wrongfully accused ? Is that her case ? GRIGORIADIS : That is exactly what she 's saying . Yeah . She 's interested in this idea of gender discrimination going both ways . GROSS : So have her guidelines taken effect yet ? GRIGORIADIS : No . They have n't . They were leaked to The New York Times . There will be a notice-and-comment period . You know , we have to see also if she 's going to put these out . These were a draft that The Times got their hands on . GROSS : My guest is Vanessa Grigoriadis , author of the new book , `` Blurred Lines : Sex , Power , And Consent On Campus . '' We 'll talk more after a break . This is FRESH AIR . -LRB- SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC -RRB- GROSS : This is FRESH AIR . Let 's get back to my interview with Vanessa Grigoriadis , author of the new book , `` Blurred Lines : Sex , Power , And Consent On Campus . '' So let 's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing . What was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses ? GRIGORIADIS : There was a huge shift in the definition of sexual assault from , like , 2014 to '17 while I was there , and I watched as it happened . Many students said to me that they were n't sure if groping counted as sexual assault . Maybe it had to be penetration . By the end of those three years , that idea was completely blown out of the water . And I even had students say to me , you know , sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people , the way you aggress on people in speech and make them feel , like , just dirty , like a sexual object . I mean , they were thinking through this idea , how far can we actually take this ? GROSS : So is there no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now ? GRIGORIADIS : I do n't think that there 's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is . I think that people who are enlightened about this issue understand that it does n't have to include penetration . But I think that part of why a good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we do n't have a national definition . GROSS : So you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined . And the slogan used to be no means no , but now it 's yes means yes . What 's the difference between no means no and yes means yes ? GRIGORIADIS : Well , there 's a huge difference . Something like yes means yes is , OK , until you get some sort of yes , you do n't really have permission to touch somebody . Now , a yes , you know , in the college definition could be verbal , or it could be - they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning , which I suppose means a moan or a groan or pulling off clothes , et cetera . And from looking at this and researching it , I did n't agree with this at the outset , but I came convinced that this is a really good standard for young people and perhaps for older people , as well . Certainly , anybody who 's in a workplace who might have a crush on somebody else , you know , you 've got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals . People do that all the time . GROSS : So why were you resistant to this yes means yes standard , and why did you change your mind ? GRIGORIADIS : Well , I 'm an adult . You know , I 'm in my 40s . And I know that that 's not the way sex usually happens . I mean , sex is something that is unspoken , that 's kind of energy between people and more exciting , in some ways , when it 's like that . You know , we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps . They barely know these people . That 's part of the titillation , part of the charge . But - and I 'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act , which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes . I do think that a question is not that big a deal . In Gen X , we had the question , you know , should I get a condom ? Which was always kind of a question about protection , but it was really a permission question . There really has to be an extra question . GROSS : You write that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is that it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness . What do you mean ? GRIGORIADIS : Well , one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls do n't always say no . They certainly do n't say it that way - no , get away from me , I 'm pushing you away . Right ? They say , well , maybe another time , I do n't think I want to do this tonight - until they end up giving up . You know , some of the most interesting work that 's being done now in terms of trying to fix this problem is about girls understanding the signals from people who might intend them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happens . Because people understand once they 're in the room , it 's really hard to get out . GROSS : Well , you know , the thing about yes means yes is , a lot of people say , that 's so awkward to kind of have these , like , rules , like , almost like a questionnaire . Like , I authorize you to , like , you know , take off my shirt , or whatever . But it 's equally awkward , I think , for the woman to be in the place where the man is making all these advances and you have to say no , no , no . Stop . No . I really mean stop . No . Ok . I 'll leave . No . It just puts all of the responsibility on her , and it makes it , like , really awkward . And it 's not a shared awkwardness . It 's , like , one person having the full burden of the awkwardness . GRIGORIADIS : Exactly . So this is a little dorky . OK . But it definitely changes things . I mean , I went to a dance party - I like to go out and dance at night - recently . You know , guys try to come up and dance with you , and you try to get away . And this guy came up , and he was about to put his arm around me , and then he said , is it OK if I put my arm around you ? And I said , no . -LRB- Laughter -RRB- You know ? 'Cause I did n't want his arm around me . And he said , yeah , I get it . Consent . I totally get it . I understand . I 'm glad I asked . GROSS : Was that the first time that happened to you ? GRIGORIADIS : That was definitely the first time -LRB- laughter -RRB- that 'd happened to me . I mean , yeah . I did n't think that that man intended me harm , but I did n't want his arm around me . I had no interest in him . I 'm married . I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing . So I think that 's a great thing to have that happen and to have young girls who truly , you know , are in nightclubs or at dance parties a lot , understand , like , this is my body . I own it . People have to ask permission to touch it . GROSS : My guest is Vanessa Grigoriadis , author of `` Blurred Lines : Sex , Power , And Consent On Campus . '' We 'll talk more after a break . Ken Tucker will review an early recording by Hazel Dickens and Alice Gerrard , who brought a feminist perspective to bluegrass . And Justin Chang will review `` First Man '' starring Ryan Gosling as astronaut Neil Armstrong , the first human to walk on the moon . I 'm Terry Gross , and this is FRESH AIR . -LRB- SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC -RRB- GROSS : This is FRESH AIR . I 'm Terry Gross . Let 's get back to my interview with Vanessa Grigoriadis , author of `` Blurred Lines : Sex , Power , And Consent On Campus . '' Over the course of three years , she interviewed 120 students from 20 universities , spoke with nearly 80 administrators and experts , and read dozens of case reports . Grigoriadis is a contributing editor at The New York Times Magazine and Vanity Fair and has won a National Magazine Award . Part of her book is about the culture of fraternities and the frat parties that often lead to binge drinking . One of the fraternities you write about in your book is Delta Kappa Epsilon , known as Deke , DKE , which is at Yale . George W. Bush was part of that fraternity , and so was Brett Kavanaugh . Why did you decide to look at Deke , and what did you learn about it in terms of the sexual environment ? GRIGORIADIS : Well , I think that Deke , at the time that Kavanaugh was there , was actually a pretty uncool thing to be part of . It was a repository of future power . And people like the ones you just described were in it , but nobody who was n't in Deke cared about Deke . But over the years , since the '80s , frats have become very popular on American campuses . You know , millennials , they like to join things . Your social network is so important right now in terms of moving forward , getting a job . Being Deke from Yale , that could maybe really help you . You know , we 're seeing students really join up with the Greek system . So the famous story with DKE is the story in the early 2010s , where a group of pledges were marching across campus and went to the Women 's Center whereupon they chanted , no means yes , yes means anal . And some of the students who were at Yale at the time really thought that this was the straw that broke the camel 's back for them in terms of the way girls were being treated on the campus . And they ended up filing a Title IX complaint with the Office for Civil Rights about Yale and particularly DKE . And it was the first one that was filed during this kind of 2011 Obama time when Obama said , yes , students , tell us what 's happening . We want to hear from you . What 's going on on your campuses ? So it was a very important part of that history . GROSS : What are some of the ways colleges , college administrators are trying to deal with fraternities and with the binge drinking at fraternity parties ? GRIGORIADIS : There are some universities who have moved pledging either into January , or they 've moved it to sophomore year entirely because they realize that , you know , having kids start to pledge in September when the sexual assault risk is the highest is just madness , right ? Now you have kids pledging a frat . And who knows what kind of dares they 're going to be told to take ? And they 're going to be getting wasted every night as they 're hazed . I mean , this is just hideous . So I think there are some frats that are trying to bring in courses about sexual assault , trying to be more enlightened about it . I wrote ... GROSS : The fraternities are doing that . GRIGORIADIS : ... Extensively - sure . There are some fraternities that are doing that . Yeah , definitely . I wrote extensively about Wesleyan , where I went to school , which is , you know , not exactly known as a frat haven . But there were a bunch of frats there . And while I was reporting the book , they - Wesleyan decided to shut all of those frats down . GROSS : So , you know , I did n't know this till I read your book , but sororities are - by the Greek code or whatever it is - sororities are n't allowed to serve alcohol at their parties . Only fraternities can do that . And that 's a kind of unequal status right there because it means that it 's the men on campus who are going to control of the party atmosphere since people expect alcohol at parties . GRIGORIADIS : Oh , absolutely . I mean , this is the key issue that universities have . Boys still really dominate the social scene on college campuses . Not only are 1 in 6 American boys who go to four-year colleges are in frats now , which is a population that 's up by half in the last decade , guys get the kegs , right ? Guys buy the drugs . You ca n't even have parties at sororities in America . That 's the Panhellenic rule . So the guys get to have the parties at their houses . And they set the rules . And they set the costume theme . And the theme is always something like `` Little Mermaid , '' for the girls to come really scantily clothed . So I was just kind of shocked that the `` Animal House '' ethos , which we used to think was just a small sliver of the American college experience and almost a joke , has really spread out across America , where you can just do whatever you want to do . And then when it 's over , it 's all scrubbed . And it 's just that crazy thing you did in college . Well , no , actually , because there 's a lot of girls coming out of here with a lot of traumatic experiences . GROSS : You know , some women are saying now what we really need to do in order to , like , stop or at least diminish the amount of sexual assault on campus is to stop rape culture . What is meant by that ? GRIGORIADIS : So rape culture is a term that really just tries to connect the dots between an American society that turns this blind eye to sexual assault and the true experience of girls , which is that they are experiencing a lot of sexual assault . So , you know , this rape culture is a culture where there are rape myths that a woman 's outfit or her alcohol consumption has caused her rape . And nobody questions these attitudes that box in the victim . Like , nobody says , it does n't matter that you were dressed a certain way or it does n't matter how much you drank . They say , well , victims are kind of weak . And they can lie . And maybe they 're just crazy or maybe they 're gold diggers . There 's all these reasons why a woman would make up this story . Maybe she 's just trying to lie so she does n't get in trouble with her boyfriend , et cetera . So what we really see about - among this young generation is this refusal to participate in that culture . And also , very differently than the '90s , when I was in college - back then , of course , we talked about sexual assault a lot in the early '90s during , you know , that PC era . But what we were taught is carry mace , go to a self-defense class , right ? Protect yourself because boys will be boys . And the best you can do is make sure that you 're safe on your own . Now these girls are saying , no . It 's not our problem . It 's your problem , right ? And their signs will say things like , do n't get raped , and then they 'll cross out some of the words so it 's , do n't rape . No , it 's boys who have to change . It 's the institutions that have to change . This is about institutional accountability . GROSS : Let 's talk about the message that young men and women are getting from pop feminism . And I 'll use Beyonce as an example here . I mean , she is a symbol of empowerment to so many women . And so many men and women just , I mean , adore her , understandably . At the same time , in so many of her concerts over the years , she 's dressed in very sexualized clothing . And a lot of the clothing , it 's - and this is true of a lot of women like pop stars and hip-hop stars . It 's very sexualized and kind of designed to call attention to the most sexual areas of the body . So , you know , you could see it one way , like it 's a sign of my sexual empowerment , or you could see it another way , I 'm offering myself to you as an object , as a sexual - as somebody - I want you to look at me sexually . I want you to see my power as being sexual power or at least partly sexual power . And I am inviting you to really focus your gaze on the most sexual parts of my body . And , again , you can see that as empowerment or you could see that as objectification . And I 'm just wondering if you have any thoughts about that or if that 's an issue that came up a lot when talking to young women on campuses . GRIGORIADIS : Well , it 's certainly not an issue that came up when I spoke with the young women because they completely believe it 's empowering . But it 's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas . Is this empowering or is this denigrating ? And , you know , being somebody who comes from second-wave feminism , I - my knee-jerk reaction is , like , you guys are calling this self-objectification . Is n't that just a ruse ? Is n't that just some way you 're justifying this kind of way that you 're presenting yourself ? But after speaking to so many of these students , I truly changed my mind about that because I realized , like , this is how they grew up . You know , these kids that I interviewed in college just graduating now , you know , Britney Spears was like - they were just tiny when Britney Spears was out . The culture has been so saturated with sex the entire time that they 've been growing up . They 've been growing up around pornography , around fashion and that is much , much scantier than anything that I grew up with . So they do n't have the same ideas about , oh , if I dress this way , it makes me look like a slut because this is the way people dress now . There 's such a casual way . And you 're right . In a lot of concerts of Beyonce or Katy Perry , Rhianna , you know , it 's crossing a line away from scanty to something extremely sexual . But this is what they believe is empowering to them . Now , we have all sorts of data also saying that they have a huge amount of nervousness about it . And they feel anxious and depressed if guys do n't like their social media posts , et cetera . So there 's a flip side to that . But they were adamant with me that this was only to the good that they were presenting themselves . GROSS : So you write in your book , we 're in the process of developing new power dynamics in the bedroom , an area where feminism has previously not been able to reach . So just explain what you mean by that . GRIGORIADIS : Well , I think this raising of demons that has been going on through the #MeToo era is allowing women not only to say , these are the things that happened to me in the past that I might call sexual assault or I might just call things I was extremely uncomfortable with , and now going into the future , I want to be treated differently in the bedroom . I want to be asked what I want . I want to be able to say no tonight and have that actually be heard . I think that behavior always kind of lags behind attitude shift . We 're definitely in the attitude shift now . But I truly believe that that kind of most private act is beginning to shift . GROSS : Vanessa Grigoriadis , thank you so much for talking with us .

When you get to your seat and go to store your carry-on in the overhead , you 'll find there 's no room , and have to go forward or back to find an empty space . Until the plane gets mostly full , that 's not an unreasonable assumption . Today , more than a backpack or small personal bag costs money one way or another , so the number of people who _ need _ that much overhead space has come down quite a lot . It 's the `` Karens '' , who `` demand to see a manager '' at the boarding gate or after they 've boarded who delay everyone . I could see a benefit to boarding them semi-randomly . In my opinion there really should be a special compartment in the cargo hold for that kind of people , preferably non-pressurized and non-heated ;-RRB- Probably also include those that ca n't store their carry-on correctly either so it 's necessary to rearrange the compartment to fit everything . And of course those who still do last-minute shopping when they should be at the gate boarding should probably be banned from airports completely . My boarding method , for Complete Bastard Airlines -LSB- youtube.com -RSB- , is that you get ten minutes to board and if you miss that because you 're spending the ENTIRE TIME FUCKING RUMMAGING AROUND IN YOUR BACKPACK WHILE STANDING IN THE AISLE , well , there 's always later flights available , have your credit card ready . There 's more , too . If you 've got a screaming baby , please sit in the rows marked `` drop chutes '' . Too fat to fit in a seat ? No problems , just head to the back and ask our chefs to accommodate you . Tastes just like pork ... uhh , chicken . Oh , and we 've got something special for anyone thinking of hauling on six suitcases and two backpacks , but that 's left as a surprise for when you fly with us . Yep . I 've noticed it only takes them half as long to get off the plane when it interests them . Reminds me of when I used to work at an airport boarding international flights . It was an almost daily occurrence to have people come sauntering up after the door closed , a fresh cup of Starbucks in hand , then start screaming to let them on the flight . In fact , there were multiple times when , if we still had ticketed passengers who had n't boarded yet and it was time to close the door -LRB- remember people , departure means departure from the gate , not locking up the plane -RRB- I would go out to the hallway and look That 's the exact opposite of the reality of modern airline travel . Because a lot of airlines have reduced check-in luggage , hand luggage has increased significantly over the years . In fact , many airlines even offer a zero check-in luggage option such that the only luggage option IS hand luggage . Such a thing never even existed about 15 years ago . Which is why the airlines all * ought * to charge for the overhead space but make checked baggage free . The current baggage fee structure defies all logic . You never run out of space in the cargo hold but you do run out of overhead bins . But yet for most airlines the overhead bins are cheaper . And even for those where it is n't true , the price difference is n't enough to motivate anybody to check bags -LRB- although it does seem high enough that people can suddenly travel with way less stuff and the bins generally do n't fill up -RRB- Southwest does n't charge for up to checked bags , but does n't charge for carry-ons either . I think this does relieve some of the carry-on pressure . I 'm grateful that they do n't charge for carry-on , though , as I often travel with expensive electronic equipment that I do n't really want to put in checked baggage . I usually limit my carry-on to one -LRB- small -RRB- backpack . Everything else goes under . That 's not actually true any more , since the airlines have found that carrying rush cargo is worth more than carrying suitcases and they do n't have to worry about sorting it . I was on an international flight recently where you could only check one bag `` because of limited cargo hold space '' , and watched while they loaded multiple containers for an international logistics company . Airlines need to start enforcing carry on baggage limits . I have a `` massive '' 30L backpack , if what I need for a trip cant fit in it , I 'll check a bag . I 'm not the problem , it 's the people refusing to check bags , either out of cheapness or arrogance -LRB- I.E. the `` I 'm not waiting to collect a bag '' crowd -RRB- . If people with oversized carry on bags were stopped at the gate , we 'd all have plenty of room in the overhead bins . You mean they do n't ? It 's been a while since I went to the USA but here in Europe they 're really strict . Most airlines here have a bag monitor who goes down the line before boarding . If your bag does n't fit completely inside their `` maximum allowed size '' box then you 're charged extra for it . These days almost every flight is a full flight so the gate agents will often offer/ask passengers if they want to check bags at the gate to free up overhead space . Some people will shoot for this from the get go because you basically get a free checked bag or 2 . In some cases I 've also seen forced checking of rollerboard carry ons , but that is a little more rare . I 'm actually in the `` if I carry on , the airline/TSA ca n't lose/break/steal my stuff crowd . '' If that was n't such a problem , I 'd be checking a lot more bags instead of bending over backwards to fit everything I need in a carry-on . Air Canada did n't on the flight I was on last week -LRB- CAN$ 30 or so for each checked bag -RRB- . A number of people boarded with absolutely huge carry-ons . One early 20s guy a -RRB- had apparently never been on a flight before because he could not find his seat given the information on the boarding pass , and b -RRB- had a gigantic piece of luggage that looked like it would take up at least half of an entire overhead bin . I helped him find his seat , but left him shaking his head , bewildered about what he was going to do wit Another problem is that they board from front to back , creating the maximum possible delay for anyone wanting to get on . A number of other airlines board back to front , so everyone gets to spend ten minutes rummaging around in their luggage without holding up boarding for those further down the plane . Wendover Productions already covered this -LRB- of course -RRB- . Basically , there are a bunch of strategies that will work for faster boarding , but airlines are n't going to use them . The higher paying passengers will board first , so they get the overhead bin space first , people with bags that wo n't fit will have to have them checked . Thus , encouraging people to pay for more expensive tickets and earlier boarding groups . Yep I immediately thought of this video too . There are ways to do boarding much better but they all fail when faced with reality . Ideally you 'd want to funnel the passengers in a precise order down to the exact seat , as the video demonstrates , but you 'll never get people to line up that way . Like maybe you could have seating in the waiting area arranged in this order based on the assigned seats : you come in , find the correct waiting seat based on where you 'll be in the aircraft , and start boarding after the Is n't this done already ? I remember having seen this or something very similiar in action boarding at Detroit Airport two or three years ago . Four tiers of boarding , with the first tier being the premium tickets and handicapped , and the others in IIRC different sectors and alternating rows . The Slowpokes among the passengers moaned quite a lot about this `` complicated '' system and even most Normies were quite unhappy about it , because apparently very few non-nerdy people can accept sitting outside the aircraft On the contrary , this is n't done already , and your example of premium boarding first directly contradicts the finding that boarding slowest passengers first is optimum approach . Consider that premium passengers are seated at front so have fastest transit time , atop having less seats per row so less impediment to loading luggage , so premium passengers will overall be faster than economy passengers and thus should be boarded LAST , yet premium passengers are boarded first despite penalty for overall delay . It I would suspect that they were wrong due to not understanding their customers . Business travelers consider their time very valuable but also consider checking bags to be anathema . They could probably charge significantly more for the overhead bins than they currently do . And certainly higher prices for suitcase carryons and many people would pay it . They probably would n't have to make checked bags free but probably should make them relatively cheap otherwise people will feel fleeced . Thus I 'd also highly suspect the research results between different airlines -LRB- especially budget ones that charges for check-in luggage -RRB- would greatly differ , with the hand-carry / check-in charges becoming a strong predictor of boarding time and influencing which would have been the fastest loading method . Actually , the corollary objective here is to minimise on-the-ground time of the plane . The plane earns money when in flight , so making sure that the boarding process goes faster will boost the airline 's bottom line by a few percent because the airplane can shave a few minutes off of its time on the ground . Yes and no ; the airlines want fast turn times , but they also need schedule buffer . Simultaneous loading and unloading of passengers -LRB- front + rear -RRB- would provide a greater reduction in turn time , but no airline is trying to go that far for good reason . The capital cost of a single aisle plane is about $ 5-10k per day depending on age . If you are looking at 8@2 hour segments per day , that is 1,200-1 ,600 seats per day , or $ 8/seat at the high end . An extra segment drops that by $ 0.50 . All other major costs -LRB- includi Lots of airline does that . . Though it is not up the airline . It is controlled by the airport , and all the airlines in airports without skywalks -LRB- the stupid metal tubes -RRB- , usually have boarding in both ends as it is easy and obvious with mobile stairs . I never understood why they boarded first class passengers first . I 'd rather wait a bit longer in the lounge instead of sitting on the plane for another 20 minutes while all the economy class peasants shuffle past . Not that I 've ever flown first class , I 'm just dreaming about it when I 'm an economy class peasant . To stop the assholes in the last row from putting their carry-on bags in the first open bin in the front . That would force the upper class passengers to move back to get their bags when leaving the plane slowing everyone down included the assholes in the back row , but the assholes in the back row are too dumb to realize they are just slowing themselves down . Mind you , I have turned up later in the boarding process when on a plane where there are either multiple doors or the business class section is to the l You need to come to London . London Heathrow airport is one of the few airports where I 'll say that rocking up 2 hours before your flight is plenty of time . Security is organised and fast , the biggest problems are the fact US rules have been foisted on us so we still need to take off our belts . You 'll spend more time walking to your gate than getting through security at Heathrow . I 've had similar experiences at Amsterdam Schipol airport . Both airports handle in excess of 35 million passengers a year . Con It depends which terminal and how busy it is . Most recently I went through Heathrow Terminal 5 and security lines were pretty long . They also arrange it so that it 's very hard to determine which queue avoids the nudie scanners , where as at Tokyo Haneda they signpost it for you . The biggest issue with Heathrow , especially the supposedly state-of-the-art Terminal 5 , is that the baggage handling is incredibly slow . At Narita you wait 10 minutes for your bag , at Heathrow Terminal 5 you wait an hour . It 's really If you 're in the US and travel with any frequency at all , do yourself a big favor and apply for Global Entry . It 'll cost you $ 100 and an annoying trip to the airport -LRB- usually -RRB- for an interview and fingerprinting , but you 'll get to use the TSA Pre-check lines for five years . Keep your shoes on , your laptop in your bag and walk through the metal detector . Better yet , the line is typically dramatically shorter and filled with other people who do this all the time and have optimized for it . The security screening queues are caused SOLELY by incompetence . If there was n't enough capacity the queue would grow all day until all passengers miss their flights . Without enough capacity queues are only created due to the capacity not being applied timely , which is trivial to do when you literally have a schedule of when passengers need to get through and to their planes . Would be eliminating the fee for checked luggage . IMO a big part of why boarding is slow is people looking for overhead storage . For me the speed of boarding is whatever , more annoying is when disembarking the bozos that get in the aisle that are n't ready to exit the plane making everyone stuck behind them wait for them to get their shit together . The problem with that is that having checked luggage adds ~ 30 minutes of waiting at the destination airport and non-zero risk of your stuff being lost -LRB- and the risk increases the further away from home you are -RRB- . If I can make the trip with just carry-on I 'll do it every time . Sometimes I check the bag on the return trip . It 's necessary if you bring back stuff like liquor , plus it does n't matter so much if the bag gets home a week or three later . At home I have other clothes to wear . You can sometimes volunte This . Ever since you do n't have a free bag anymore , I noticed that overhead bins are regularily filled to and often beyond capacity . And finding a free space somewhere takes a lot of time , clogging up the process . It 's also why I 've moved from my previous `` anyway it does n't fly faster , let 's wait here with room and a view and board near the end '' attitude to `` let 's board early so I have an overhead bin '' . Sad , really . My strategy is `` let 's board early so I can stop having to pay attention to whatever the airline people are doing and focus on whatever I 'm doing . '' Or the equivalent and more lucrative strategy that airlines are already working up to : Charging as much -LRB- or more -RRB- for carry-on luggage . Personally , I 'll never check luggage if I can possibly avoid it . I hate waiting at the luggage carousel , and I 've had too many experiences where my luggage went astray . I once had to attend a business meeting wearing ripped cutoff jeans and an old t-shirt because my luggage did n't show up -LRB- this was in Australia , and I arrived on Sunday afternoon and the meeting was at 8 Yeah departing is where you save time IMO , since the planes will still wait for the one family that 's in first class and running 10min behind anyways . Think every plane I 've been on I was sitted and waiting for at least 20min before the plane actually taxied . I find it worse how long planes take to turn off the seat belt signs and let you use the washrooms . I 've had some shorter hop flights say 2.5 hrs where you spent 10min in line to board , then 30min on the ground before take off , then another 30min or so b The last time I flew we were in the middle of the plane . I was with a few of my kids and I figured I should set a good example by waiting for our zone to be called to board . We were nearly the last ones on the plane . In fact everyone in the 2 zones behind us was already on the plane and all the overhead bins were full . Lesson for the kids : Never listen to the boarding agents or and be suspicious of any airline official . Sad Which airline ? All the airlines I 've flown check your ticket to verify that you 're actually seated in the zone they 're calling . In fact a couple of them print the zone on your ticket -LRB- or display it on your e-ticket -RRB- so the gate agent can tell at a glance if you 're trying to sneak in before your zone is called . That 's true for one passenger but they also know that if they * do n't * argue , everybody would adopt the strategy . So it 's a local maximum but a global minimum . So yes , they argue . And if you are belligerent with the airline crew , the police will help you adjust your attitude . And they do n't care much about customer service except maybe a little for their frequent fliers but those people already get to board first . I regularly see gate agents sending people to the back of the line . Most of them seem to say it quite a bit louder than necessary , to shame the passenger a bit . I 've even seen one who looked at the boarding pass and , without a word , turned and grabbed the phone to make a gate announcement and reminded everyone -- in an irritated tone which guaranteed that everyone turned to look -- that they must wait until their zone before boarding , and that right now the plain was boarding zone X , not zone Y . The agen At best , the gate agent knows whether the passenger next in line has the current group number or the higher lower number . However , until the next group higher than mine is called I ca n't tell whether the people between me and the gate have an equal or lower group number , and are just taking their turn to get the pass scanned and board , or are in a higher group and are blocking my way . In fact everyone in the 2 zones behind us was already on the plane There is no way any airline , except maybe in some third world country , is letting people board out of zone order . I have been on a lot of flights all over the world and they have always carefully checked the zone on peoples ticket . It 's not like there is arguing , they tell the people they are in the wrong boarding group and the people leave to come back on later . Whatever you saw was very much an exception to how boarding works for most of the world -LRB- I think Iceland was a free-for-all like that though -RRB- . Heh . My favorite was Air Rarotonga . The gate agent just shouted `` 11:00 AM for Mangaia now boarding '' from the open doorway out to the tarmac , then walked away . No security check . No boarding pass check . The pilot just craned his neck around and counted noses before taking off . Of course , the plane only seated 15 . Obviously , if boarding is any kind of concern in a non-emergency -- in an emergency , people will likely die . Before an aircraft is approved it must be filled and emptied of passengers in a certain amount of time . Aircraft manufacturers rehearse this test -- instead of putting a proper amount of doors in the aircraft in the first place . It would seem that the FAA rules must change to add more doors , to eliminate choke-points -- instead of rewarding this kind of research . As a very frequent traveller , I find that the comments opposed to this scheme , here seem to have missed the boat . All of the challenges described so far - -LRB- passengers not being smart enough to understand the scheme -LRB- they do n't have to be smart - the airlines just implement the boarding process with boarding numbers on their ticket -RRB- , time is being saved in the wrong place - boarding vs security -LRB- security lines are an airport problem and do n't really cost the airlines money ; the boarding process being ineffic A-List on Southwest gets you earlier boarding , so you are more likely to get the seats you want . Their reward programs are a little different than the other airlines , but good . In particular , their Companion Pass is a really nice benefit . I travel a lot for business and on average , I 'll take Southwest over the other major airlines assuming they have a direct flight . I say that as someone who also has Platinum on AA , so it 's not that I only fly Southwest . 1 -RRB- Let handicapped board 2 -RRB- Let families with children board next . And you 'll reduce the remaining boarding time quickly . One of the biggest delays in flight boarding stems from the fact that most families , are not going to afford the premium boarding . So they wind up boarding toward the end . -LRB- Plus it is a lot more challenging to get out the door with an infant and a toddler , than as a single person . -RRB- Now that family is trying to find a block of seats in the same row and/or column . This is important to them Usually like to get on towards end if I can fit carry on below seat . Strive for an aisle and happy to get up and let those on inside out except during the meal but sometimes u got to go . Happens have to accommodate , could be me one day . If airlines allow plenty of time to board then usually order not so important . But sometimes plane arrives late and need to board quick so an efficient process would be welcome . But while first and business class have space to allow passengers to get out of the way since mor There is not enough storage space overhead . There is a fee for checked bag now a days invariably . People lug bigger and bigger suitcases far beyond their ability to carry . Make sure there is enough for everyone , strictly enforce the size and weight limits , have a crew to pre load all bags first , boarding time can be reduced . But the saving the time and hassle of passengers is not the priority . Rest of the airplane turn around time is longer than boarding time . So there is no incentive to minimize it any fur People also need to learn to pack more efficiently . I work for an airline so do n't have to worry about paying for checked bags but I still rarely check bags unless absolutely necessary . If I am flying somewhere for less than a week my baggage consists of a backpack for under the seat and a duffel bag that I keep less than full so it can squeeze into any small available space in an overhead . I just do n't want to fool with baggage claim when I land , I want to walk right out . During the summers in college I On my last trip abroad I had toilet roll with me . And duct tape , parachute cord , magnetic hooks , a larger marker pen and enough clothes to wear clean underwear and shirts every day for ten days without washing anything . Then I packed a washing machine too . All of that was checked . Carry on was the $ 8000 of camera kit . Sure , I was only gone for three months and only visited five continents , but you always want to be prepared . All of these models are such oversimplification to the point of being useless in real life . 1 -RRB- If they call `` group 6 may now board '' , the order of the passengers within that group is completely random . This algorithm assumes you can board passengers sorted individually . Are they supposed to spend 2 hours prior to boarding time organizing passengers into a 1-n line ? This basically means prioritizing boarding time over passenger comfort . 2 -RRB- People pay to board first . The study tries to maximize boarding time , but the real goal is to maximize revenue and passenger comfort , so this should be taken into account . 3 -RRB- Overhead bin space competition causes lots of delays as people walk back and forth looking for space . 4 -RRB- All these models assume the passengers are independent . You can not board kids by themselves . Why ca n't these model take into account families instead of idealized independent passengers ? 5 -RRB- How exactly would you determine who is a slower passenger ? Does the gate agent guestimates based on age , weight , gender , race , etc ? yeah , that wo n't cause problems . Do you ask passengers `` are you fast or slow ? '' , yeap , totally fine , nobody would lie or get offended right ? If you have an idealized model of perfectly independent , honest , sortable , patient passengers , where the _ only _ thing that matters is boarding time , this problem becomes * trivial * . As in any half decent computer science can come up with a good result and claim to solve what no airline can . Clearly this simulation assumes perfectly spherical passengers boarding a frictionless plane . Thank you , I 'll see myself out . So this reminds me , in general , of a bit of a curse I think software developers and people who are analytical in general bear . How many of you find yourself waiting in line , or otherwise in some kind of queue or going through some process , standing there realizing not just how inefficient the process is , but how easy it would be to optimize it ? Really , this happens to me all the time . Dropping kids off at school and watching where and how the cars stop to let kids out . Waiting to get my kid off the bus from Plenty of comments here -LRB- quite rightly -RRB- bitching about people being selfish on both boarding and disembarking ; standing in the isles while they sort through their shit , something all the old hands have done way before , many times . But ... I often see these same `` sky warriors '' trampling and pushing past the old , infirm and mothers with children ... Guys , take 30 seconds to help these people board and stow their stuff ; things go faster and you 're being a good person instead of a dick . Remember , the plane leaves whe Two features make even the crappiest configured airport support faster boarding : 1 . Twin aisles 2 . An L2 door forward of the engine that is capable of boarding , and point the only jetway at it - first class people turn left and coach can board while first class pre-departure services go on without interference . Want to see fast boarding ? Find a United 767-400 . They have a usable L2 door and two aisles , with a maximum of 7 across in coach -LRB- configured as 2-3-2 -RRB- . Meaning each square of aisle space is only need People like you are why we cant have nice things . If you 're in row 25 , and you have to put your bags in row 30 , you might have to wait an extra 5 minutes to get off the plane , if that . By putting your bags in row 10 and forcing the people in row 10 to put their bags in row 30 , you are adding a 10 - 15 minute delay to them getting off , possibly causing them to miss a close connection . But I guess clearly your time is more important than everyone else 's . To be fair : Most gate PA systems make it impossible to HEAR what they say in the first place . Add in some foreign language people and the first step to enforce ANY sensible system of boarding would be loud and clear announcements . People ca n't think ahead for anything . I live in a major metropolitan area where public transit is pretty good . I commute to work via bus starting early . The other passengers are also commuting for work at that hour . They do this five days a week . Most people simply tap their transit card and keep boarding . And yet there are some who have to fumble around with getting out their transit card , or -LRB- even worse -RRB- pay by cash and have to fumble around looking for the exact fare .

June 2022 is when they 'll be gone for good , but it depends on which platform you 're on -LRB- via 9to5Google -RRB- . Previously , we knew that Chrome apps someday would n't work on Windows , macOS , and Linux , but today , Google revealed that Chrome apps will eventually stop working on Chrome OS , too . A Chrome app is a web-based app that you can install in Chrome that looks and functions kind of like an app you 'd launch from your desktop . Take this one for the read-it-later app Pocket , for example -- when you install it , it opens in a separate window that makes it seem as if Pocket is functioning as its own app . You probably do n't need to worry about the death of Chrome apps messing up your browsing experience too much . At this point , most apps on the web are just regular web apps , which is why you 'll be able to keep using Pocket without issue in much the same way by navigating to https://getpocket.com/ . In rarer cases , you might also be using Progressive Web Apps , which are basically websites that are cached to your device so they can have some offline functionality and be launched like an app . Some Chrome apps you have installed may already redirect to websites , like many of Google 's apps . And Chrome extensions are also different from Chrome apps , and those will keep working just fine . There 's a pretty decent chance you 're not using any real Chrome apps at all , even if you use web apps all the time . When Google first announced all the way back in 2016 that it would end support for Chrome apps on Windows , macOS , and Linux , it said approximately one percent of users on those platforms were actively using packaged Chrome apps . That was nearly four years ago , and web developers have moved on . If you do use Chrome apps , they will stop working much sooner on Windows , macOS , or Linux than they will on Chrome OS . Here 's Google 's timeline : March 2020 : Chrome Web Store will stop accepting new Chrome Apps . Developers will be able to update existing Chrome Apps through June 2022 . June 2020 : End support for Chrome Apps on Windows , Mac , and Linux . Customers who have Chrome Enterprise and Chrome Education Upgrade will have access to a policy to extend support through December 2020 . December 2020 : End support for Chrome Apps on Windows , Mac , and Linux . June 2021 : End support for NaCl , PNaCl , and PPAPI APIs . June 2021 : End support for Chrome Apps on Chrome OS . Customers who have Chrome Enterprise and Chrome Education Upgrade will have access to a policy to extend support through June 2022 . June 2022 : End support for Chrome Apps on Chrome OS for all customers . To break that down a bit : At some point in June 2020 , Chrome apps will stop working on Windows , macOS , and Linux , unless you have Chrome Enterprise or Chrome Education Upgrade , which lets you use Chrome apps for six more months . If you 're on Chrome OS , Chrome apps will work until June 2021 . Again , if you have Chrome Enterprise or Chrome Education Upgrade , Google says you can use Chrome apps for an additional year . Originally , Chrome apps were supposed to stop working on Windows , macOS , and Linux in early 2018 , but in December 2017 , when Google removed the Chrome apps section from the Chrome Web Store , it pushed that early 2018 deadline to an unspecified date in the future . Now , more than three years later , we finally know when Chrome apps wo n't work on those platforms -- and when they wo n't work on any platform at all .

1.0	{"docid": "0NrncVdv", "title": "Leather Life : Bi Plus Us", "content": "Hello , my name is Steve and I 'm monosexual . I learned I 'm monosexual -LRB- meaning I am attracted to only one gender -RRB- from Emily Csuy , who was in many of my grad school classes at Minneapolis College of Art & Design -LRB- MCAD -RRB- . As the capstone -LRB- final -RRB- project for her recently completed Master 's degree from MCAD , Csuy designed and created a website called `` Bi + Us '' -LRB- biplusus.com -RRB- . The list of words our community uses to describe ourselves keeps expanding and growing . The `` B '' in `` GLBT '' has long stood for `` bisexual , '' or `` bi '' for short . Someone who was bisexual was attracted to both men and women . Now , as gender definitions and possibilities have multiplied in recent years , the concept of bisexuality has needed to expand to encompass these new possibilities . So `` bi '' has evolved to become `` bi-plus '' or `` bi + '' . On her website , Csuy states that `` Bi + is an umbrella term referring to ` non-monosexual people with the capacity to be attracted to more than one or any gender . ' Bi + people may identify as bisexual , pansexual , queer , omnisexual , polysexual , two-spirit , fluid , demisexual , other , or may reject labels altogether . '' But bi + people have a problem , as did bisexuals before them : `` bisexual erasure '' or `` bisexual invisibility . '' Csuy 's website quotes GLAAD 's definition of bisexual erasure/invisibility as `` a pervasive problem in which the legitimacy of bisexuality -LRB- either in general or in regard to an individual -RRB- is questioned or outright denied . '' Personally , I saw bisexual erasure and invisibility firsthand when I came out as a gay man in the 1970s . At that time many of my gay friends , when told someone was bisexual , quickly responded , `` He 's not bisexual -- he 's just confused . '' Back then , in the gay male circles in which I traveled , bisexuality was often seen as the first tentative step in coming out as gay . Gay men assumed that the bisexual person thought it was safer to say they were attracted to both sexes than to admit that in reality they experienced only same-sex attraction . My gay male friends were denying someone 's bisexuality in the same way that many voices in mainstream society at that time were denying that gay men were really gay -- they `` just needed the love of a good woman to cure them , '' i.e. make them heterosexual . How ironic was that ? Years later , I became involved in a leather community made up primarily of gay leathermen and leather lesbians . I have since watched that community expand into the leather/BDSM/fetish community , and I have seen the community grow to include people of all gender orientations and all affectional preferences . Over the years , I have met many people in this community who identify as bisexual . So while I identify as monosexual , I am definitely a bi + ally . But , unfortunately , bisexual erasure/invisibility has continued to be a problem . I have talked to leathermen whom I knew as gay who later told me they were really bisexual . They also told me that they did n't feel they could admit their bisexuality to their gay male friends because they would thereafter be viewed with suspicion . Paradoxically , bisexuals also are sometimes viewed with suspicion by the mainstream heterosexual community . Csuy created the Bi + Us project and website as a way of dealing with bisexual erasure and bisexual invisibility . Csuy describes the site as `` a media guide for bi + people using positive representation to address the issue of bisexual erasure . The goal of Bi + Us is to highlight the music , TV shows and books any bi + person may find personally helpful , comforting or validating . '' The website includes clickable links to videos and an audio playlist . The colors of the website are based on the magenta , blue and lavender colors of the Bi Pride flag . The Bi + Us website also includes downloadable and printable brochures listing music , TV shows and books that feature bisexual characters or themes in a positive and proud light . Much of the media included on the website and in the printable brochures involves bi + musicians , actors , writers , characters , or themes . Both the brochures and the website are excellent resources both for bi + people and for their allies . -LRB- Bonus : Because this is a website created by a design student , it 's a really good-looking website . -RRB- Csuy compiled the lists of music , TV shows and books on the Bi + Us website by conducting a survey of bi + people asking about `` media they connected with through their bi + identity and/or viewed as having positive bi + representation . '' If you identify as bi + and would like to add other media not yet included in the project , you can take the survey by clicking a link at the Bi + Us website . Anyone who is exploring their bisexual nature will find much food for thought , inspiration and pride in the works Csuy highlights on the Bi + Us website .", "url": "https://www.lavendermagazine.com/our-lives/leather-life-bi-plus-us/", "kws": ["Leather", "Design", "bisexual", "bisexual^^erasure/invisibility", "bisexual^^invisibility", "bisexuality", "themes", "gender", "bisexuals", "Master", "labels", "Art", "GLBT", "MCAD", "women", "excellent^^resources", "music", "writers", "positive^^representation", "Gay^^men"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Society": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Society_Other": 1.0000100135803223}}}

Cora would not be the former Red Sox manager today if he had n't been implicated by Major League Baseball in a pair of electronic sign-stealing schemes . His transgressions as bench coach of the Astros and , allegedly , in Boston certainly merited his departure Tuesday night . How the franchise moves forward promises to offer a stern test of character . Chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom never could have anticipated such a challenge so early in his tenure . The first formal statement issued by the club seemed to convey genuine emotion at being forced to reach such a conclusion . Wednesday 's press conference at Fenway Park brought more of the same for roughly 45 awkward minutes . Club CEO Sam Kennedy went out of his way on multiple occasions to use the phrase offered by the Red Sox on Tuesday . Boston and Cora `` mutually parted ways '' -- not a firing , not a resignation . `` It 's not ideal , '' Red Sox principal owner John Henry said . `` It 's not what we would like to be doing at this point . We were all surprised to read this report on Monday . '' Cora was named 11 times in the nine-page document released by MLB commissioner Rob Manfred to begin the week . Cora 's central role in Houston 's malfeasance brought both a personal dark cloud and one that threatened to linger over any future employer . The current MLB investigation into Boston 's 2018 champions could make Cora a two-time loser at Manfred 's office doorstep . `` Everyone acted in the best interests of the club and knew it was best to part ways , '' Kennedy said . `` -LRB- Cora -RRB- was remorseful . He apologized . '' The Red Sox had no choice . And it feels like they 're trying to give Cora an eventual chance to rehabilitate his career after he serves any potential upcoming ban from Major League Baseball . It speaks more to the human side of Cora and what he created in Boston than some of the actions that led to the end of his time here . To bestow that single label of cheater on Cora -- some sort of scarlet letter or all-encompassing epitaph for his brief tenure -- is to miss the point entirely . There are real psychological consequences to face for Red Sox staff members and players in the coming weeks and months . Cora 's two years with the club seemed to leave a personal connection not seen since Terry Francona was last at the helm in 2011 . `` My brother , more than my manager , you were a friend , a pana -LRB- pal -RRB- and advisor during these two years , '' Red Sox pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez posted on his personal Instagram page late Tuesday . `` I learned a lot from you . Thank you for everything . '' Hiring Cora to serve as Boston 's 47th manager started as an unquestioned triumph . The Red Sox were bringing in a winner , a well-liked former player who understood both the product on the field and the media game off it . Boston was also taking another significant step toward addressing its shameful overall record regarding race relations , with Cora representing its first manager of color . His debut season in 2018 was something out of a dream . Cora guided the Red Sox to a franchise-record 108 wins and playoff victories over the Yankees , Astros and Dodgers . That final Chris Sale strikeout of Manny Machado on an October night in Los Angeles seemed to make Boston immortal . In fact , it was the high point that preceded what has been a shocking 15-month fall from grace . What 's left behind most of all is uncertainty . Bloom is presiding over his first real managerial search . Players who were clearly aided by Cora 's uncanny motivational touch -- Rodriguez , Rafael Devers , Christian Vazquez and Xander Bogaerts come to mind -- will be forced to find common ground quickly with the fourth Red Sox manager in a decade . Despite being handsomely paid and accustomed to the vagabond 's existence that accompanies a life in professional sports , players have feelings . They bleed . They occasionally struggle for confidence . They 're still affected by success and failure just like the rest of us . Cora seemed preternaturally equipped to handle that part of the job . But it was his own thirst for victory -- his fatal professional flaw , as it turns out -- that led to his downfall . Boston 's acceptance of that fact began Wednesday afternoon , and its organizational future will be determined by what comes next . bkoch@providencejournal.com On Twitter : @BillKoch25", "url": "https://www.providencejournal.com/sports/20200115/bill-koch-cheater-yes-but-there-was-more-to-alex-cora", "kws": ["Alex^^Cora", "cheater", "Bill^^Koch", "Sam^^Kennedy", "Rob^^Manfred", "Eduardo^^Rodriguez", "scarlet^^letter", "grace", "Red^^Sox", "Xander^^Bogaerts", "Terry^^Francona", "BOSTON", "Dodgers", "bench^^coach", "Chaim^^Bloom", "Christian^^Vazquez", "Major^^League^^Baseball", "Astros", "Houston", "Yankees"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Baseball": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Baseball_MLB": 1.0}}}

That sentiment has remained pretty timeless . Just as loneliness remains as much a problem in the 21st century as it was millennia ago -LRB- see Channel 4 ' a shocking documentary Catching A Killer : A Diary from the Grave -RRB- , so the urge to find a loving partner is strong in any era . This is what makes watching the TV show Love Island so fascinating and entertaining . For those who have been living in a cave , Love Island is an ITV2 reality show that involves young , single British volunteers of both sexes staying in a beautiful villa in a hot country -- South Africa this time -- and trying to find love . It 's the bluntness of the premise that is so exciting . There is no pretence about ` going out for a drink ' , ` going clubbing ' , or ` starting a hobby ' , as there was for oldsters like us when we went looking for a partner . This means no awkward sidling up to people at the watercooler , asking what they did with their weekend , and casually suggesting a drink while you turn a temperature that would cause the water in the cooler to steam . No , it 's all very easy . You enter the villa and couple up with someone of the opposite sex -LRB- the series has remained hetero so far , but there 's no reason why it ca n't successfully admit gays in future , as Big Brother did -RRB- . Then , if someone else subsequently takes the fancy of any of the contestants , they are free to try and build a relationship with them instead . This of course involves sensitive negotiation , and it is watching how individuals handle rejection as part of their journey to potential love that is so often compelling and touching . Boris , Brexit and the Irish border Contrary to the splutterings of the Permanently Outraged , there is little sex seen by the viewers . The contestants might embrace , kiss , and do things in their beds , but they always make sure they 're well covered with the duvet . It would take a very determined curtain-twitcher to evince a semblance of sex from the moving parts under the covers . Green-inkers looking to write hypertension-fuelled letters of protest about filth would do better to watch Channel 4 's vacuous and rather grotesque Naked Attraction , where more brazen young people choose partners based on examining their bodies , including genitals . Tip : do not watch this while eating a grey soya sausage . As with all good reality shows -- and that means a fraction of the total output -- it always takes a while to get into Love Island . But slowly , as the personalities become clear , one gets drawn into the psychological workings of each contestant 's mind and the relationships they build up . It is these interactions -- an advanced form of people-watching -- that is intriguing . Although the contestants may all look equally glamorous and beautiful to start with , clear differences in personality become evident pretty quickly . In shows where the general public has a say about who stays in and who goes , like Love Island and the late Big Brother , it 's always reassuring to see which criteria are valued by viewers . Looks count for nothing without personality . It is not the most attention-seeking and voluble contestants who are necessarily liked ; it is those who show integrity , kindness and emotional intelligence . Many people think it 's possible to play a game on reality TV , but most people get caught out sooner or later if they are dishonest , hypocritical or fake . As in last year 's show , which was the first Love Island I watched , it is heartening that , despite the ululation of people like Philip Pullman about the racism of the British , people do n't care about race , skin colour , money , or class . In this series , two girls are currently both keen on a handsome black copper , Mike . Mike is veering more towards the stunning black girl than the gorgeous white one . The most sought-after boy apart from Mike is a scaffolder . The palest , blondest boy , Ollie , who happens to be a millionaire landowner 's son , has been revealed by a feisty Scots girl , Paige , as a love-rat . Perhaps upset at being found out -LRB- his own fault : he revealed he had been unfaithful to an ex multiple times , and came on to a second girl in the show despite professing to the first that he only had eyes for her -RRB- , he has just left the villa . Since writing , I 've found out he actually left because he missed his ex-girlfriend , which is rather cute and in keeping with the inherent decency of most of the contestants . My favourite boy so far is kind , honest Mike . Sweet , cheerful Nas , a British Asian , is also very appealing for his warmth and humour . My favourite girls are the assertive , funny Shaughna -LRB- ` I 'd rather find out he 's a wet wipe on day two than day 17 ' ; ` I need to remember I 've come here to find a boyfriend , not a son ' -RRB- ; the take-no-nonsense Paige ; and stunning Siannise , who looks like my beloved nieces . Sure , the show might be accused of being ` lookist ' , but since it 's filmed in a hot location and the contestants tend to wear swimwear all day , that 's probably self-selecting : people who feel uneasy in swimsuits are hardly likely to apply . Incidentally , the wandering around in swimsuits loses its sexuality within the first few minutes , just as I imagine nudist beaches do . Watching these cheerful young people show friendliness , affection , trust and tolerance is the best riposte to those who catastrophise that normal working-class Brits have become racist -LRB- see Brexit and Megxit -RRB- or grotesquely capitalist . Teenage , or early twentysomething , kicks are still hard to beat .

In response , Democrat Governor Ralph Northam has declared a state of emergency and instituted a temporary ban on all weapons on the Capitol grounds . As a result of the recent flip from Red to Blue -LRB- largely orchestrated by pro-Chinese communists -RRB- Democrats in the Virginia General Assembly are unapologetic about plans to disarm law-abiding Virginians . Governor Ralph Northam -- having previously failed to get any traction for his citizen-disarmament policies -- now appears to see his way clear to implement them . Northam and his comrades in both houses of the Assembly have made their intentions clear . In June , he called a special session of the Virginia General Assembly to consider passing what he called `` common sense '' gun laws . Those laws would have included universal background checks ; child access prevention ; a one-gun-per-month purchase limit ; bans on all so-called assault weapons , including bump stocks and high-capacity magazines ; legal responsibilities for lost or stolen guns ; allowing municipalities to ban guns from municipal buildings ; and so-called red flag laws . He and his fellow Democrats were held at bay in June because Republicans still controlled the General Assembly . But that was then ; this is now . With the aforementioned Maoist-assisted shift in to the left in Virginia , Northam 's hands are not nearly so tied . Wasting no time , Democrat legislators began trotting out one anti-gun bill after another as soon as the legislative session began . As Roanoke , Virginia , NBC affiliate WSLS 10 News reported Monday , January 13 : The Democratic-led Senate Judiciary Committee sent four gun control bills to the Senate floor . They include : \u2022 A limit of one handgun purchase per month . \u2022 Expanded background checks to include private sales . \u2022 The ability for localities to ban guns in public spaces , including government buildings . \u2022 A Red Flag law , which gives law enforcement officers the ability to seize guns from people determined to be at risk of hurting themselves or others . That article also stated that `` There were passionate comments from dozens of gun rights supporters in the committee meeting and in a press conference held by NRA members near the Capitol . '' The NRA is not the only group to express concern over the new slate of anti-gun legislation . The Virginia Citizens Defense League -LRB- VCDL -RRB- is one of the premier gun-rights groups in the state . VCDL has planned a gun-rights rally to be held on the Capitol grounds on Monday , January 20 . That date -- Martin Luther King , Jr. . Day -- is the traditional `` Lobby Day '' at the General Assembly , when citizens converge on the offices of their delegates and senators to express their views on a wide range of issues . Wednesday -- just days ahead of the rally which is expected to draw overflowing crowds of gun-rights supporters -- Governor Northam twisted a 2012 law beyond recognition and declared a state of emergency including a temporary ban on all weapons on the Capitol grounds for Monday 's rally . That law was created to allow the governor to issue such a temporary ban `` to the extent necessary to ensure public safety in any place or facility designated or used by the Governor , any political subdivision of the Commonwealth , or any other governmental entity as an emergency shelter or for the purpose of sheltering persons . '' His application of that law to this event is a transparent attempt to pervert the law for his own political agenda . Northam is essentially declaring that the Capitol grounds is an emergency shelter . Republican Delegate Mike Watson illustrated just how ridiculous that application of the law is , tweeting , `` So the Governor has declared the Capitol Grounds a ` Shelter ' in order to get around the law . I 'm curious how many times a 14 acre plot of land has been designated an emergency shelter ? '' Furthermore , Watson pointed out in a subsequent tweet that `` per COV sheltering strategy , Capitol Square does not meet the qualifications of an emergency shelter . '' Not only that , but even Northam 's premise for the state of emergency and weapons ban stretches credulity to the breaking point . In his announcement of the measure , Northam claimed there were threats of `` armed militia groups storming our Capitol '' and perhaps even using `` weaponized drones . '' He added , `` Let me be clear . These are considered credible , serious threats by our law enforcement agencies . '' In a naked attempt to stir up fear , Northam resurrected the spectre of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville , Virginia , claiming that rhetoric used by groups planning to attend Monday 's rally is similar to what was said in the lead-up to that event . `` We will not allow that mayhem and violence to happen here , '' he said , adding of those `` armed militia groups '' that `` They 're not coming to peacefully protest . They are coming to intimidate and cause harm . '' VCDL is considering legal action to block Northam 's ban . The pressing question is whether the group has time to get a legal injunction before Monday . And VCDL President Philip Van Cleave has urged all participants at the rally -- whether or not the ban is in effect -- to avoid engaging with any counterprotesters and authorities . He has also asked all militia groups to refrain from providing security at the event , stating that police can and will handle such matters . He added , `` Lobby Day is a peaceful event about gun rights and NOTHING ELSE .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrpHW83", "title": "Contra Contra Contra Caplan On Psych", "content": "I . In 2006 , Bryan Caplan wrote a critique of psychiatry . In 2015 , I responded . Now it 's 2020 , and Bryan has a counterargument . I 'm going to break the cycle of delay and respond now , and maybe we 'll finish this argument before we 're both too old and demented to operate computers . Bryan writes : 1 . With a few exceptions , Scott fairly and accurately explains my original -LRB- and current -RRB- position . 2 . Scott correctly identifies several gray areas in my position , but by my count I explicitly acknowledged all of them in my original article . 3 . Scott then uses those gray areas to reject my whole position in favor of the conventional view . 4 . The range of the gray areas is n't actually that big , so he should have accepted most of my heterodoxies . 5 . If the gray areas were as big as Scott says , he should reject the conventional view too and just be agnostic . I think the gray areas are overwhelming and provide proof that Bryan 's strict dichotomies do n't match the real world . I also think , as a general philosophical point , that we ought to be suspicious of arguments of the form `` the gray areas are small '' . Even if this is true , and your model only fails in a few places , controversial questions are likely to be controversial questions precisely because they 're located where your model fails . Nobody challenges a model on an exactly typical case where everything makes sense . So if a point is under debate , let 's say in a fifteen year back-and-forth argument between two bloggers that 's attracted hundreds of total comments , the a priori size of the gray areas does n't matter . Even if your model is good at most things , you have strong evidence this is n't one of them . In this case , the model we 're debating is Bryan 's idea of constraints vs. preferences . My previous summary of this -LRB- which Bryan endorses -RRB- goes like this : Consumer theory distinguishes between two different reasons why someone might not buy a Ferrari -- budget constraints -LRB- they ca n't afford one -RRB- and preferences -LRB- they do n't want one , or they want other things more -RRB- . Physical diseases seem much like budget constraints -- the reason a paralyzed person ca n't run a marathon is because it 's beyond her abilities , simply impossible . Psychiatric diseases seem more like preferences . There 's nothing obvious stopping an alcoholic from quitting booze and there 's nothing obvious preventing someone with ADHD from sitting still and paying attention . Therefore they are best modeled as people with unusual preferences -- the one with a preference for booze over normal activities like holding down a job , the other with a high dispreference for sitting still and attending classes . But lots of people have weird preferences . Therefore , psychiatric diseases should be thought of as within the broad spectrum of normal variation , rather than as analogous to physical diseases . I countered by pointing out that this was in fact very analogous to physical diseases : Alice has always had problems concentrating in school . Now she 's older and she hops between a couple of different part-time jobs . She frequently calls in sick because she feels like she does n't have enough energy to go into work that day , and when she does work her mind is n't really on her projects . When she gets home , she mostly just lies in bed and sleeps . She goes to a psychiatrist who diagnoses her with ADHD and depression . Bob is a high-powered corporate executive who rose to become Vice-President of his big Fortune 500 company . When he gets home after working 14 hour days , he trains toward his dream of running the Boston Marathon . Alas , this week Bob has the flu . He finds that he 's really tired all the time , and he usually feels exhausted at work and goes home after lunch ; when he stays , he finds that his mind just ca n't concentrate on what he 's doing . Yesterday he stayed home from work entirely because he did n't feel like he had the energy . And when he gets home , instead of doing his customary 16 mile run he just lies in bed all day . His doctor tells him that he has the flu and is expected to recover soon . At least for this week Alice and Bob are pretty similar . They 'd both like to be able to work long hours , concentrate hard , and stay active after work . Instead they 're both working short hours , calling in sick , failing to concentrate , and lying in bed all day . But for some reason , Bryan calls Alice 's problem `` different preferences '' and Bob 's problem `` budgetary constraints '' , even though they 're presenting exactly the same way ! It does n't look like he 's `` diagnosing '' which side of the consumer theory dichotomy they 're on by their symptoms , but rather by his assumptions about the causes . But Bryan does n't budge : I 'm unimpressed , because I not only anticipated such objections in my original paper , but even proposed a test to help clarify the fuzziness ... can we change a person 's behavior purely by changing his incentives ? If we can , it follows that the person was able to act differently all along , but preferred not to ; his condition is a matter of preference , not constraint . I will refer to this as the ` Gun-to-the-Head Test ' . If suddenly pointing a gun at alcoholics induces them to stop drinking , then evidently sober behavior was in their choice set all along . Conversely , if a gun-to-the-head fails to change a person 's behavior , it is highly likely -LRB- though not necessarily true -RRB- that you are literally asking the impossible . I then presented multiple forms of evidence that a wide range of alleged mental illnesses are responsive to incentives . Scott barely mentions said evidence . Still , does this mean that the flu is n't `` really '' an illness either ? No . Rather it means that physical illness often constrains behavioral and changes preferences . When sick , the maximum amount of weight I can bench press falls . -LRB- Yes , I 've actually tried this -RRB- . Yet in addition , I do n't feel like lifting weights at all when I 'm sick . Anyone who has worked while ill should be able to appreciate these dual effects . If you literally get sick , your ability and desire to work both go down . When you metaphorically get `` sick of your job , '' in contrast , only your desire goes down . I reject the heck out of this answer . I agree the `` gun to the head '' test is a good summary of Bryan 's position , but we already agreed what Bryan 's position is . The only thing he 's adding here is a claim that the flu still qualifies as a real disease because it sometimes constrains behavior -LRB- the amount of weight Bryan can lift -RRB- . But nobody cares how much weight they can lift during a flu ! When we talk about having the flu being bad , we 're talking 0 % about how much weight we can lift , and 100 % about the sorts of problems Bob has -- feeling too ill to go to work , not wanting to do things , etc. . If Bryan searches hard enough , he can find a way the flu results in slightly weaker muscle strength . But if I search hard enough , I can find a way depression results in slightly weaker muscle strength . Neither of these things are what the average person thinks about when they think of `` flu symptoms '' or `` depression symptoms '' , and I consider them both equally irrelevant . But if a change in weight-lifting ability really disqualifies the flu for Bryan , we can talk about other diseases . What about shingles ? It 's a viral infection that causes a very itchy rash . But sometimes -LRB- herpes sine zoster -RRB- the rash is n't visible , and you just get really itchy for a few days . Like , really itchy . I had this condition once and it was just embarrassing how much I was scratching myself . But if you had put a gun to my head and said `` Do n't scratch yourself , or I 'll kill you '' , I would have sat on my hands and suffered quietly . For Bryan , an itch is just a newfound preference for scratching yourself . Shingles , like depression or ADHD , is just a preference shift , and so does n't qualify as a real disease . Or what about respiratory tract infections that cause coughing ? My impression is that , put a gun to my head , and I could keep myself from coughing , even when I really really felt like it . Coughing is a preference , not a constraint , and Bryan , to be consistent , would have to think of respiratory infections as just a preference for coughing . Or what about migraines ? Sure , people with migraines say they feel pain , but that 's no better grounded than someone with depression saying they feel sad . If Bryan is allowed to bring in concepts like `` pain '' , I 'm allowed to bring in concepts like `` sadness '' , `` anxiety '' , etc. . And since an anxious person feels anxiety and can not stop feeling it even if threatened with a gunshot , the anxiety counts as a constraint , and so mental disorders are constraining . For Bryan 's constraints-vs-preferences dichotomy to work at all , he has to endorse a sort of behaviorism , where we need not believe anything that does n't express itself as behavior . And the only behavior we see in a migraine is somebody lying in bed , turning off all the lights , and occasionally clutching their head and saying `` auggggh '' . But put a gun to their head and demand they be in a bright room with lots of loud music , and they 'll go to the bright room with lots of loud music . Threaten to shoot them unless they stop clutching their head and moaning , and they 'll stop clutching their head and moaning . In Bryan 's model , migraines are just a newfound preference for saying `` auggggh '' a lot . Why medicalize this ? Some people like saying `` auggggh '' and that 's valid ! Bryan 's preference vs. constraint model does n't just invalidate mental illness . It invalidates many -LRB- maybe most -RRB- physical illnesses ! Even the ones it does n't invalidate may only get saved by some triviality we do n't care about -- like how maybe you can lift less weight when you have the flu -- and not by the symptoms that actually bother us . II . We need a model that lets us describe shingles as something more than `` this person has a preference for scratching themselves frantically , and that preference is valid , nothing to worry about here '' . I do n't have a beautiful elegant version of a model like this yet , but I think Bryan himself has gone most of the way to an at-least-adequate one . In his post The Depression Preference , Bryan admits that most depressed people do n't want to be depressed . But he terms this a meta-preference -- a preference over preferences . They have depressive preferences -- for example , a preference for sitting around crying rather than doing work . They would meta-prefer not to have those preferences . But they do have them . I agree this is a fruitful way to look at things , but I think we have to be really careful here , and that using the same term for endorsed meta-preferences and unendorsed object-level preferences is preventing this level of care . Let 's call endorsed preferences which people meta-prefer to have `` goals '' , and unendorsed preferences which people would meta-prefer not to have `` urges '' . I think this closely matches our intuitive understanding of these terms . Suppose I created a sinister machine that beamed mind control rays into Bryan 's head and gave him an urge to constantly slap himself in the face . This urge could theoretically be resisted , but it 's so strong that in practice he never managed to resist it . It did n't make him enjoy slapping himself in the face , or think this was a reasonable thing to do . It just made him compulsively want to keep doing it . He loses his job , his friends , and his dignity , because nobody wants to be around someone who 's slapping himself in the face all the time . I hope we can common-sensically agree on the following : 1 . This is bad 2 . Bryan would want to find and destroy the sinister machine 3 . That would be a pretty reasonable goal for Bryan to have , and society should support him in this This seems a lot like the shingles case . A sinister outside imposition -LRB- the viral infection -RRB- gives its victim an urge to constantly scratch themselves . It does n't make them enjoy scratching themselves , or think this is a reasonable thing to do . These people want to cure their shingles infection , and everyone agrees this desire is reasonable . But this also seems a lot like some cases of OCD . Did you know that a subset of childhood OCD is caused by a streptococcal infection ? So again , you get a sinister outside imposition -LRB- an infection -RRB- that gives its victim an urge to , let 's say , wash their hands fifty times a day . It does n't make them enjoy washing their hands , or think this is a reasonable thing to do -LRB- some OCD patients do believe their rituals are necessary , others do n't -RRB- . These people want to cure their OCD , and I at least agree this desire is reasonable . If you would support the sinister machine victim and the shingles victim , it 's hard for me to see a case for putting the OCD victim in a different category . I agree I 'm using as clear a case as possible -LRB- most mental disorders are n't obviously due to infections -RRB- , but both Bryan and I are trying to avoid bringing specific facts about biology into this mostly-philosophical debate . The distinction between goals and urges turns what looked like an acceptable situation -LRB- these people are following their preferences , which is good -RRB- into an unacceptable situation -LRB- these people 's goals are being thwarted by unwelcome urges which they ca n't resist -RRB- . I expect most of Bryan 's skepticism to focus on those last two words -- `` ca n't resist '' . He will no doubt bring up his gun-to-the-head test again . If we put a gun to the head of a shingles patient , they could stop scratching . So although we can be sympathetic to the trouble their unwanted new preference causes them , how can we recommend anything other than `` just suck it up and resist the preference '' ? The best model of decision-making I know of comes from research on lampreys . Various areas of the lamprey brain come up with various plans -- hunt for food , hide under a rock , wriggle around -- and calculate the `` strength '' of the `` case '' for each one , which they convert into an amount of dopamine . They send this dopamine to a part of the brain called the pallium , and then the pallium executes whichever plan has the most dopamine associated with it . Suppose I have shingles . I 'm giving a speech to a group of distinguished people whom I desperately want to impress . Then I get a very strong itch . Part of my brain calculates the expected value of continuing to speak in a dignified way , and converts that into dopamine . Another part calculates the importance of scratching myself vigorously , and converts that into dopamine . The pallium compares these two amounts of dopamine , one is larger than the other , and the decision gets made . If the itch is bad enough , and if whatever lizard-brain nucleus makes me want to scratch itches has enough dopamine to spare , then I never had a chance . `` But , '' Bryan objects , `` if I put a gun to your head , and threatened to shoot you if you scratched the itch , you would n't do it , would you ? '' In that case , a part of my brain calculates the expected value of continuing to speak in a dignified way plus not getting shot . This is a very high expected value ! It sends lots and lots of dopamine to my pallium . The part of my brain calculating the expected value of scratching the itch and getting shot calculates this as a very low-expected-value course , and sends some a very low -LRB- maybe negative ? -RRB- signal . The pallium decisively selects the plan to keep speaking and not get shot . To summarize : the brain compares the strength of various preferences and executes the strongest . Anything that strengthens your urges at the expense of your goals makes you more likely to do things you do n't endorse , and makes you worse off . In a counterfactual world where a threatened gunshot is also weighing down the scale , maybe the calculus would come out different . But in the non-counterfactual world where there is no gunshot , the calculus comes out the way it does . -LRB- also , if Bryan uses his gunshot analogy one more time , I am going to tell him about all of the mentally ill people I know about who did , in fact , non-metaphorically , non-hypothetically , choose a gunshot to the head over continuing to do the things their illness made it hard for them to do . Are you sure this is the easily-falsified hill you want to die on ? -RRB- This model does n't use the word or the concept of `` choice '' anywhere . There are various algorithms mechanically evaluating the expected reward of different actions , and a more central algorithm comparing all of those evaluations . Those algorithms could have resolved differently in different situations , and you can be uncertain how they will resolve in the same situation , but there 's no point at which they actually could resolve differently in the same situation . If this makes you want to start debating free will -- in either direction -- I can not recommend this Less Wrong post highly enough . A few examples to hammer this in : 1 . Most weekends , Alice stays in and reads a book -LRB- preference strength 20 -RRB- . But today is her firstborn child 's wedding , which she has been looking forward to for years -LRB- preference strength 100 -RRB- . Just before she leaves for the chapel , she gets a terrible migraine , and she feels like it would be unbearable to go out of her room -LRB- preference strength 200 -RRB- . Since 200 is greater than 100 , Alice misses the wedding and feel miserable , since she would have meta-preferred to go to the wedding . If you had threatened to shoot her unless she went to the wedding , she would have gone to the wedding and been miserable the whole time , because she is terrified of death -LRB- preference strength 9999 -RRB- and 9999 is greater than 200 . 2 . Bryan is a responsible member of society and wants to work hard and take care of his family -LRB- preference strength 100 -RRB- . He drinks some alcohol , but because he has no genetic or environmental risk factors for alcoholism , it does n't make him feel any urge to drink himself to death -LRB- preference strength 0 -RRB- , so he does n't . If we CRISPRed him to give him every single alcoholism risk gene plus crippling anxiety , then drinking the alcohol would make him feel a very strong urge to drink himself to death -LRB- preference strength 200 -RRB- , and he would drink himself to death instead of caring for his family . 3 . CRISPRed alcoholic Bryan goes to an addiction doctor . The doctor advises him to take the anti-alcoholism drug naltrexone -LRB- -20 preference strength for alcoholism -RRB- . Then the doctor advises him to go to Alcoholics Anonymous and get a whole new friend group in which his status depends entirely on his ability to remain sober -LRB- +20 for staying sober -RRB- . Now his preferences are `` stay sober and take care of my family '' -LRB- strength 120 -RRB- vs. `` drink myself to death -LRB- strength 180 -RRB- , but the preference to drink is still stronger , so he does . 4 . Bryan goes to a therapist who asks him to visualize the things he loves about his family and why he thinks it 's important to take care of them , which makes this more vivid in his mind -LRB- preference +10 for sobriety -RRB- . Bryan 's boss threatens to fire him if he misses one more day of work because of drunkenness -LRB- preference +20 for sobriety -RRB- . Now he 's at 150 for sobriety vs. 180 for drinking . He gives $ 20,000 to Beeminder , which they will only give him back if he stays sober for the next year -LRB- +20 for sobriety -RRB- , and he reads George Ainslie 's Picoeconomics which describes ways to reconceptualize choices across time to better account for all of their implications -LRB- +20 for sobriety -RRB- . Now he 's at 190 for sobriety vs. 180 for drinking , so he stays sober . 5 . A few months later , Bryan 's friend dies in an accident . He feels angry , depressed , and anxious . This makes alcohol seems more attractive , since it would temporarily help him forget these feelings -LRB- +20 for drinking -RRB- . At the same time , he stops going to AA because it 's annoying and far away -LRB- -20 for staying sober -RRB- . Now he 's at 170 for sobriety vs. 200 for drinking , so he falls off the wagon . I 'm not claiming this lamprey model is exactly literally true for humans . And I 'm not claiming there 's a perfect binary distinction between endorsed goals and unendorsed urges . This model is full of complications and gray areas . I 'm just saying it 's a better model , with fewer gray areas , than trying to separate everything into just `` preference '' or `` constraint '' , and shooting yourself in the foot again and again like some kind of tipped-over Gatling gun . And it goes a lot of the way to modeling mental illness : the mentally ill have conditions that give them strong unendorsed urges . For any given strength of goal , having strong urges will make people less able to pursue that goal , in favor of pursuing the urges instead , and that will make them worse off , for a definition of `` well off '' that involves being happy and achieving goals . These people very reasonably want to stop having these weird urges so they can pursue their goals in peace . Bryan will correctly point out that there are awkward implications in identifying `` unexpected generator of strong unendorsed urges '' with `` disease '' . For example , gay people in a traditional religious community will have strong urges to have homosexual relationships , and they wo n't endorse those urges -- they would probably rather be straight instead . Or : obese people feel an urge to eat which they do n't endorse . Should we call obesity a disease , and describe them as having a disease which produces urges contrary to their preferences ? Some people say yes -LRB- and keep in mind that both genetics and viral infections can induce obesity -RRB- . But suppose some normal-weight person would rather be supermodel-thin , and their perfectly normal urge to eat a normal amount prevents them from looking like a broomstick . Do they have a disease ? A naive equation of `` biological generator of unendorsed urges '' and `` disease '' would say yes ! We want some criteria that let us call shingles a disease , but do n't let us call `` being thin but wanting to be even thinner '' a disease . Unfortunately , there is no perfect solution to this problem . People have wanted perfect solutions to definitional questions ever since Plato defined man as `` a featherless biped '' , and it 's never worked . Luckily , there are kludgy , good-enough solutions , which I describe in Dissolving Questions About Disease , the fourth most popular Less Wrong post of all time . If you still think this is confusing , please read it . If it 's still confusing even after that , try The Categories Were Made For Man , Not Man For The Categories . I think Bryan should be happy with this solution . It 's very libertarian . It says that it 's up to every individual to decide how to satisfy their own preferences -LRB- including meta-preferences -RRB- . If your problem is constraints -LRB- you want to go to Hawaii , but you do n't have enough money -RRB- , you can work to resolve those constraints -LRB- eg go to work and earn more money -RRB- . If your problem is urges -LRB- you want to go to Hawaii , but you 're too anxious to leave your room -RRB- , you can work to resolve those urges -LRB- eg go to a psychiatrist and get medication -RRB- . The job of a good liberal society is to support people in achieving their own goals as they understand them , and this includes supporting their decision to get the job they want and their decision to get the psychiatric treatment they want . As I write this essay , I 'm a little bit caffeinated . I looked at my preference set -- which included an urge to get back in bed instead of writing blog posts -- decided it did n't achieve my goals , and took a psychotropic drug to shift my preference set to one I liked better . And if we 're willing to accept this in relatively trivial cases , the argument for accepting it is even stronger for people whose preference sets have been deranged by obvious bizarre causes -- infections , hormone imbalances , brain injuries , addictive substances , genetic defects -- and for people whose irresistible urges are ruining their lives in preventable ways .", "url": "https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/01/15/contra-contra-contra-caplan-on-psych/", "kws": ["Contra^^Contra", "Bryan^^Caplan", "Psych", "Scott", "depressive^^preferences", "weird^^preferences", "psychiatry", "biology", "Alcoholics^^Anonymous", "Alice", "concepts", "multiple^^forms", "normal^^variation", "gray^^areas", "CRISPRed^^alcoholic^^Bryan", "weight^^Bryan", "endorsed^^preferences", "definitional^^questions", "Plato", "research"], "text_category": {}}

Today , the Department of Education issued new federal guidance that opens the floodgates for coercive prayer and religious activity in our public schools . Additionally , the Trump administration proposed to roll back regulations for faith-based service providers , putting people at risk by undermining critical religious freedom and civil rights protections . `` President Trump is n't trying to protect religious freedom ; he 's pandering to religious extremists who want to inject a narrow set of religious beliefs into our public schools and taxpayer-funded services , '' said Rachel Laser , president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State . `` On Religious Freedom Day of all days , we must make clear that religious freedom demands that everyone be free to practice their faith , or no faith at all , but only so long as they do n't harm others . Religious freedom is not a license to grant unparalleled religious privilege . '' School Prayer Guidance : Issued by Trump , Attorney General William Barr and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , the guidance invites religious coercion in our public schools . This will lead to bullying , harassment and ostracism that will predominantly impact LGBTQ students and religious minorities -- students already at risk from the rise in hate crimes and discrimination in our country . Already , about 75 percent of the religious freedom violations reported to Americans United occur in our public schools . `` We could n't agree more with President Trump that students should never be discriminated against for voluntarily praying at school -- that is why AU fights every day to protect the First Amendment , which already guarantees them that right , '' Laser said . `` What the president has failed to do , however , is protect those students who do not wish to participate in religious activity . We have no doubt that the president 's use of his microphone to invite prayer in public schools opens the door to more constitutional violations such as students feeling pressured to bow their heads at school events or participate in team baptisms . Anyone who truly values religious freedom knows we must protect everyone 's right to pray , or not pray , as they choose , free from government intrusion . '' Specifically , the guidelines : Encourage students to speak `` persuasively '' about religion to their classmates , opening the door to proselytism and harassment . Encourage students to pray at school events , including graduations , sporting events and student assemblies . Invite public school teachers to participate in religious activities with impressionable students . Invite discrimination on the basis of religious beliefs and against LGBTQ children by school-sponsored religious student groups . Create a process for intrusion into local school districts by the federal government regarding school prayer and religious activity in order to override their decisions . For a detailed look into school prayer , read this report by Americans United , an organization founded nearly 75 years ago to protect religious freedom in public schools . `` Praying for Common Sense : The Truth About Religion in Public Schools '' outlines the constitutional violations set out in today 's guidelines , a history of federal law and Supreme Court precedent on religion in schools , and real-life violations from schools across the country . Regulations for Faith-Based Organizations : The administration 's proposed rules would apply to thousands of organizations receiving billions of taxpayer dollars to provide services such as foster care , food assistance for children and the elderly , preschool , housing assistance , disaster recovery aid , mental health and substance abuse treatment , help for survivors of domestic violence , vocational training and veterans services . `` These rules undermine the civil rights and religious freedom of millions of our most vulnerable Americans who rely on social services -- with particularly dire consequences for LGBTQ people and religious minorities , '' Laser said . `` No one should be denied the help they need because their government-funded provider condemns who they are , who they love , or what they believe . '' The rules would : Strip away existing protections that require faith-based providers to offer an alternate provider if people feel unwelcome or uncomfortable because of the religious affiliation , activities or messages of a faith-based organization . This puts people 's chances of getting help at risk because they may feel pressured to participate in religious activity or be surrounded by religious symbols that differ from their views . If people have to find their own alternative provider , it is one more hurdle they have to face to getting services . For example : A gay homeless teen might forgo getting services like housing , food , medical care , group and family counseling , or afterschool care if they know the religion of the faith-based provider condemns them for being gay . Eliminate the requirement that people seeking services be informed of their religious freedom rights -- that they ca n't be required to pray or participate in religious activities , that they are entitled to be offered an alternate provider and that they can file a complaint if their rights are violated . Eliminate the safeguard that ensures people who use vouchers to get services have at least one secular alternative to faith-based providers to choose from . As a result , taxpayer funds will be used to pay for religious programming without providing people an alternative . This could have the biggest impact on those living in rural areas where another provider could be miles away or nonexistent . Put the interests of taxpayer-funded religious organizations ahead of the interests of people who seek government services at every turn . The regulations unduly emphasize the religious exercise , mission and independence of faith-based providers and invite them to seek religious exemptions . In doing so , the rules are paving the way for providers to refuse to provide key services and opening the door to discrimination in taxpayer-funded programs . By emphasizing the religious character , mission and independence of faith-based providers , the rules are paving the way for providers to require people to participate in religious activities when seeking taxpayer-funded services . The regulations affect eight federal departments and agencies : The U.S. Departments of Agriculture , Education , Health and Human Services , Homeland Security , Justice , Labor , Veterans Affairs and the U.S. Agency for International Development . Similar regulations are expected to be issued soon by the Department of Housing and Urban Development . Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington , D.C. Founded in 1947 , the organization educates Americans about the importance of church-state separation in safeguarding religious freedom .", "url": "https://www.au.org/media/press-releases/trump-uses-religious-freedom-day-to-violate-religious-freedom-for-public", "kws": ["Religious^^Freedom", "Religious^^Freedom^^Day", "religious^^freedom^^protections", "religious^^minorities", "religious^^beliefs", "religious^^activities", "religious^^extremists", "religious^^activity", "religious^^coercion", "religious^^exemptions", "religion", "taxpayer-funded^^religious^^organizations", "religious^^symbols", "religious^^programming", "unparalleled^^religious^^privilege", "faith", "Americans", "coercive^^prayer", "Americans^^United", "public^^schools"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Society": 0.9998262524604797}, "second_cat": {"Society_Religion": 0.9998262524604797}}}
1.0	{"docid": "0NrpdTlQ", "title": "10 Ways to Dress a Grownup Silhouette", "content": "Whether you 're now a 32C , a 34DD or a 36G , know that breast size and shape continue to change with age . It 's normal . Everything from declining estrogen to weight gain or loss , working out and plain old gravity prompts our breasts to get bigger and saggier , and lose their firm , perky roundness . Unfortunately , our growing and evolving bustline affects how our clothes fit . No one is immune -- not even celebrities . Here are 10 key tips that can make your bosom a true buddy . 1 of 1 . Keep your breasts lifted . For a sleek , firm look under clothes , your breasts should `` sit '' midway between shoulder and elbow regardless of their size or your overall body proportions . Any lower and your midriff will get lost . You want an uplifting front and side view with a clear space for your torso . Then stand up straight ! The best bra ca n't do its work if you 're always hunched over your iPhone or standing slumped and slouched . Keep your shoulders back and down like a dancer or a movie star . 2 of 2 . Get a `` cool '' full coverage bra . Finding a bra in a style you 'll love wearing and feel comfortable in is key , but do n't get hung up on cup size . You can be a DDD in one brand and an F in another -LRB- or even a DD -RRB- . The bra you want to do the job is a smooth T-shirt bra style with lightly lined foam cups for a natural rounded look -LRB- great if your breasts are saggy , uneven or shallow on top -RRB- or a minimalist wireless style engineered to lift and contour . Skip bralettes , push-ups and old-style `` grandma '' bras -LRB- even if , like me , you actually are a grandma -RRB- . Get fitted by a pro in a store or try sites like ThirdLove , True & Co. , Lively and Harper Wilde that offer advice on sizing to personalize fit . 3 of 3 . Make form-fitted clothes your go-to style . Show your shape with tops and dresses that skim over your breasts or cling in a good way . Do n't worry : If you 're wearing a lightly lined seamless bra , nothing will show through -- even under tees , bodysuits and superfine knits . Trying to compress , diminish or flatten big or saggy breasts by hiding them in oversized tops will just make them look bigger and saggier . You may want to go up a size in very fitted sweaters , though , simply because it looks more polished . Choose black or dark tops instead of white to minimize volume . 4 of 4 . Define your waist . A belt -- even a very skinny one -- really makes the point that your breasts and middle are not actually a unit . Unless you 're wearing the right bra , it 's easy for breasts , midriff and waist to get crunched together in a blurry shape . However , if you 're following tips No. 1 , 2 and 3 , once you get your breasts up and off your midriff your torso will gain inches of space right beneath your bra band and seem longer , slimmer and belt-ready . Cinched shirtdresses and jumpsuits are ideal choices here , too . 5 of 5 . Fake a waist . Suppose you have big breasts , a tummy bulge and your real waistline is completely MIA . No problem . Just choose dresses with a raised , not-quite empire style that sits somewhere below the bust to a few inches above the waist , or belt any dress above the real waist at that same point . It 's a sneaky way of faking a waist and letting your breasts benefit from the narrow part of your rib cage . When wearing a relaxed blouse or tee , or generously cut shirt with pants or jeans , do a French tuck -LRB- tuck in the front only to restore that waist definition and avoid a tentlike look , but maintain a fashionably undone look at sides and rear -RRB- . 6 of 6 . Wear wrap dresses and tops to get an hourglass shape . This style has amazing manipulative bosom-contouring powers . The crossover shape of a wrap is basically an X that creates a waist or whittles an existing one while holding and supporting your breasts in a flattering dual sling . Just be sure the wrap has enough fabric to cover your breasts and bra without providing a cleavage show so you can move about freely . Faux wrap styles work , too , though you will have less control over shaping . 7 of 7 . Count on a fit-and-flare dress to balance your proportions . This dress combines the benefits of a fitted top -LRB- which firms and flatters your bust -RRB- with a skirt that flares to a wide A-line shape . The combination evens out body proportions so you do n't look top-heavy by shifting extra volume below the waist to the skirt . Midi hemlines with their extra fullness give this style even more power . Pair your fit-and-flare with a heel -LRB- even a low one -RRB- , since that further elongates your legs for an additional body boost . And yes , all of the above add up to complement your bust . Trust me on this one . 8 of 8 . Wear a tailored jacket . Structured blazers give soft bodies and full breasts a sculpted , firm look . It 's one of the reasons for the current surge in pantsuits . The straight lines and sharp V of the jacket firm up excess curves immediately . Just be sure to choose a style that 's nipped at the waist and buttons right below the bust to avoid a boxy look . Even worn open , a blazer still works to frame your bust and camouflage any extra fullness at the sides of your bosom . If you do unbutton that jacket , remember to keep the waist of the pants defined with a tucked in top or a slim belt for breast flattery . 9 of 9 . Choose necklines wisely . We 're seeing more celebs on the red carpet with extra revealing cleavage , but it 's not the best idea for real life . The inverted triangle of a V neckline never fails to flatter grownup chests . It 's subtly sexy , visually adds inches to your neck and torso , and prevents a big chest from looking too solid and shelflike . Unbutton blouses and shirts to a V -LRB- and yank the sides open a bit -RRB- for the same effect . However , if you 're a trendy dresser try the fashionable square neckline . The broad angular shape reveals more upper chest , which frames a substantial bosom for a more balanced look . For those who still like high necklines -- say a crew or a turtleneck -- just make sure it 's fitted to keep your chest looking robust , lifted and shapely . 10 of 10 . Use full sleeves to flatter , divert and distract . Sleeves that puff , flare , balloon or flutter are doing more than looking stylish . They 're a handy voluminous optical illusion that has the power to grab attention away from your bust . The bigger the sleeves , the more attention they get . For a more practical everyday approach , switch to raglan and drop-shoulder style tees and sweaters that provide ease through the chest without looking baggy or oversized . And do yourself a favor : If you 're busty , trade classic T-shirts with short sleeves that end level with your bust for three-quarter sleeve styles . It 's a small change and a bit of an optical illusion , but it makes all the difference .", "url": "https://www.aarp.org/entertainment/style-trends/info-2020/style-tips-large-bustline.html", "kws": ["grownup^^chests", "Dress", "dresses", "clothes", "jacket", "oversized^^tops", "Choose^^necklines", "body^^proportions", "three-quarter^^sleeve^^styles", "go-to^^style", "Sleeves", "excess^^curves", "perky^^roundness", "bodysuits", "Midi^^hemlines", "form-fitted^^clothes", "pantsuits", "ideal^^choices", "superfine^^knits", "soft^^bodies"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Lifestyle": 1.0000096559524536}, "second_cat": {"Lifestyle_Other": 1.0000096559524536}}}

That 's the first instruction from Mike Petersen , a retired soil scientist and agronomist . Petersen was a presenter at Wednesday 's South Platte River Salinity Workshop presented by the Centennial , Morgan and Sedgwick County Conservation Districts . Petersen manages the Orthman Research Farm near Lexington , Neb. , and consults with growers regarding strip-till system technology , fertilizer , crop development , root development , and water management . The agronomist addressed misconceptions about salinity in the South Platte Valley during Wednesday 's program . Chief among those misconceptions is that a good rainfall or snowmelt , along with cover crops and no-till practices will solve the problem . That ai n't so , Petersen said . `` It ai n't ever going to be like the good old days , '' he said . `` Change is mandatory . '' That 's a radical departure from the attitudes expressed in May 2019 when salinity in the South Platte first came to the public 's attention . In an article by Shay Castle of Fresh Water News the message was that it 's too soon to tell whether salinity is a problem in the South Platte . That 's when Colorado Corn announced it was sponsoring a study of the issue . That study was completed in October and is due to be released later this month . According to preliminary information in the report , the lower reaches of the river have become pretty salty . Phil Brink of Colorado Cattleman 's Ag Water Network led off with an overview of the issue , which he said has been followed in the Colorado River basin for several years . Brink said salinity levels below Hoover Dam are about 723 milligrams per liter , or about what is in the South Platte just below Denver . By the time the river gets to Sterling , however , that salinity has skyrocketed to 1,275 mg/l , almost twice as salty as the Denver reaches . While much of the problem stems from treated wastewater discharged by municipalities and industries upstream , agriculture is compounding the problem . The re-use of return flow water from upstream irrigation is concentrating salts from cropland and leaching it into the river , where it 's diverted or pumped onto crops and the cycle starts over . There are things that can be done to mitigate the damage , however . Petersen said no-till cultivation and leaving residue on the soil surface is the first step farmers need to take . Better water management , crop rotations and alternative crops are other methods producers can use to minimize salinity in the soil and , thus , in return flow to the river . `` That 's the good news , but it 's going to cost everyone something , '' Petersen said . `` And there 's just no option .

With three Academy Award nominations , including a win for her supporting role in 2016 's Fences , five consecutive Emmy nominations since 2015 , including a win for her starring role in the long-running ABC legal drama How To Get Away With Murder , two Tonys for her stage work -LRB- Fences , King Hedley II -RRB- , plus so many more , the South Carolina-born , Rhode Island-raised actress still remembers the uncertainty and lack of self-confidence she felt as an impoverished African-American child growing up in a largely white community . Were it not for family , teachers and even strangers along the way to reinforce the idea that she had value , she says she may have never overcome the adversity of her humble beginnings . As How To Get Away With Murder winds to a close and she says goodbye to Annalise Keating for the last time this Spring after six seasons , Davis finds herself in a good place emotionally and creatively . Married to fellow actor and producer Julius Tennon , with who she has a young daughter , Genesis , Davis appears to be balancing career and family with aplomb . Davis now appears with her The Help co-star Allison Janney in the Amazon Original movie Troop Zero , which begins streaming Friday , Jan. 17 . Dressed in black leather pants and top for an interview , the revered actress spoke about her newest film , in which she plays Rayleen , a chain-smoking paralegal working for a country lawyer in rural Georgia in 1977 . The widower lawyer -LRB- played by Jim Gaffigan -RRB- is too disorganized to properly take care of his adolescent daughter , Christmas Flint -LRB- Mckenna Grace -RRB- . Uninterested in becoming the child 's surrogate mom , Rayleen tries to resist her boss ' attempts to leave the girl in her care . However , when Christmas organizes a small troop of local misfits into a scouting troop to compete for the honor of recording their voices on NASA 's Golden Record to be sent into space , she reluctantly agrees to serve as troop mother . Rayleen butts heads with the principal of Christmas ' school , Miss Massey -LRB- Allison Janney -RRB- , with whom she 's been frenemies since they were children . Miss Massey is leading another troop of girls who may be more polished and have more scouting skills , but who are unkind to Troop Zero . But with a little determination and some much-needed guidance and support , the outcasts may just have what it takes to achieve their goal . Davis is pleased to have worked on the dramedy with the female directing team of Bert & Bertie -LRB- The Taxidermist , Phobias -RRB- from a screenplay by Oscar nominee Lucy Alibar -LRB- Beasts Of The Southern Wild -RRB- . Angela Dawson : You had a wonderful ` 70s wardrobe in this . Davis : And I loved my ` fro . It was a wig . My hairstylist , Jamika Wilson , did it . When she took it off me one night , one of the other actors said , `` I thought that was your hair . '' And my daughter responded , `` Do you know Jamika ? Do you know what she can do ? '' -LRB- She laughs . -RRB- Dawson : And you shot this in New Orleans during the summer wearing a wig ? You deserve kudos for just for that . Davis : All of us deserve kudos . Dawson : You and Allison Janney once again play adversaries . What can you say about the relationship between Miss Rayleen and Miss Massey ? Davis : I loved it . I loved that there was a history between them that went back to their childhood . I loved that there was a backstory where something deeper was going on than a vacuous villain-hero struggle . I love the fact that they were realized women too and , ultimately , they came together in friendship . And I love the fact that it 's Allison . I always say , those women from The Help -- Octavia -LRB- Spencer -RRB- , Emma -LRB- Stone -RRB- , Bryce -LRB- Dallas Howard -RRB- , Jessica -LRB- Chastain -RRB- , Miss -LRB- Cicely -RRB- Tyson -- there is a love there that is going to follow us to the grave . Dawson : It 's like your own troop . Davis : It really is . They are extraordinary woman ; I feel safe as an actor with them . I feel supported . And I feel safe as a person in expressing myself , even in private situations . I feel like I 'll be heard . I love that about them . Dawson : Troop Zero is directed by two women -- the filmmaking team Bert & Bertie . Had you worked with two directors at once before ? Davis : Never , but it was perfect . I was n't sure it was going to work , at first . It was n't that the two voices became one voice , although that was the case . Bert would direct for two days and then Bertie would come in and direct . They respected each other 's opinions . If they did squabble it was in a way that was respectful , because the creative space has to be a sacred space , where you can butt heads but know you 're respected within it and you know you 're going to be heard within it . Also , it 's what we do beautifully as women . That feminine energy of sort-of loving each other , working together and understanding that it 's more important that at the end of the day we connect for the greater good than it is for us to go off on our own narcissism and ego . That 's what it was like . It was very pleasant and fun , and I needed to have fun . I always need to have fun . I say that to my husband , `` I need to have some laughs , Julius . '' That 's why we have so much fun . Dawson : In the film , Christmas and her troop are vying for the honor of being included on NASA 's 1977 Golden Record to be spent into space in the event extraterrestrial life finds it . What message do you think we ought to send to space today ? Davis : You mean something positive or negative ? -LRB- She laughs . -RRB- We made a lot of mistakes . I relate to Christmas Flint -LSB- Mckenna Grace 's character -RSB- . I was the outsider . I was the bed wetter . I grew up as an African-American in a community that had almost none . And I grew up in abject poverty . What I will say , because I see it in our culture even now , that unless everyone matters , no one matters . If the 400 families who are billionaires left this country , we 'd become a third-world country . That goes to show you the huge gulf between the haves and have-nots . We have to embrace the least of these . There 's a huge deficit . It 's driving up the suicide rate and driving the opioid epidemic and drug addiction because people do n't feel that they matter . Unless you 're rich , unless you have money , unless you 're white , unless you 're a dude , you do n't seem to matter . The whole idea is that you have to invest in the least of these . And when you do , then you will tap into a life force that is going to help the whole . That 's very general , but that 's what I would say . Dawson : Change comes slowly . But time will tell . Davis : People rely on time too much . My husband is working on a one-man show on -LSB- abolitionist -RSB- Frederick Douglass , and there 's a quote in it that goes , `` Power concedes nothing without a demand . '' If you do n't demand it or voice it and you see what people will quietly submit to , then I 'll show you the exact measure of injustice and wrong that will be inflicted upon them . If you accept it , if you stay passive , that 's why the pendulum swings so slowly -- because we do n't demand it . We do n't force it . Maybe we do n't care enough or want risk enough . We do n't want it to cost us anything . But that 's what it takes . Dawson : Do you feel things are changing ? Davis : I do n't . Do I believe there are people out there that want change ? Absolutely . Do I have hope ? Absolutely , 100 percent . If I did n't have hope , I 'd be dead . Giving up hope is heartbreaking to me . But I do n't see that much changing happening . Dawson : I 'm going to connect what you said back to Rayleen . She 's obviously remarkably smart and should be working as a high-powered attorney somewhere . What do you think has kept her from achieving her goals ? Davis : Easy . People who said she could n't do it . I always say , you live up to your labels -- good or bad . It 's better to live up to a good label . If people are encouraging you , then you step into it . Another can happen too , which is when they tell you , `` You 're not smart enough . You 're not pretty enough . You know you 're never going to get ahead . '' You can live up to that label too . Rayleen was labeled , and she was labeled in an era where she fit all the outward signs of someone who was not going to make it . Anyone who has come out of a hard situation and has risen to the top -- there are several different factors that go into it . One of them is that they had someone who believed in them , who taught them how to master a skill -- even if it 's failure . Someone who , at the end of the day , just liked them , just thought they were awesome . If you do n't have anyone like that in your life then , trust me , it 's really hard to do it alone . Dawson : Who is that person for you ? Davis : There were many that took me from one leap pad to another . Most of them were educators . Some were strangers . Some were family members . Because that 's how many ropes you need to get out of a hole . If you watch One Nation Under Stress with Dr. Sanjay Gupta , it 's a fantastic documentary about the suicide rate in America , which is rising exponentially . It 's the gulf between the haves and have nots , and people who are just not supported , where there 's no connection with anyone , where no one has your back and no one is there for those hard times . And that 's Rayleen 's thing . Dawson : How do you think she develops the confidence to quit her job and go back to law school ? Davis : Being a troop leader is n't what she dreams about . She has n't given up on her dreams . You do n't give up on your dreams until you go to your grave . It was always her dream to become a lawyer . I think , because this is what my daughter 's given me , there is something about children that really look up to you and really need you , and you have to tap into something within yourself to guide them and nurture them , and that has healing powers . Being that leader to these kids who need a leader made her tap into the power of wanting to lead herself . It 's what I get from my daughter . My daughter 's been able to make me heal even from that little girl who always thought she was ugly , who did n't feel feminine enough , whatever . I always tell my daughter how beautiful she is and why she 's beautiful . I tell her , `` Genesis , it 's about your heart and your head . It does n't matter how cute you are or how smart you are , it 's how you treat people . '' I 'm saying it to myself as well when I say it to her . That has helped me heal myself . It 's the same thing with Rayleen . Dawson : With the final episodes of How To Get Away With Murder coming up , how do you look back on the series ? Davis : It changed my life . Like any change that happens , it comes to the point where you have to move on and see all the benefits that have come from that change , and how do you move forward with that . How do you take that and grow it ? It changed the way I look at myself as an actress and as a woman . I feel that it changed the way people look at `` the leading lady '' on TV -- the sexualized , complicated leading lady . I hope that it 's changed , even a little bit , how people view women , and how we 're seen , and what people expect us to look like , and how we have to validate ourselves by our age , our weight , our voice , before people can say , `` OK , we 'll spend some time with you .

Between the ages of 16 and 27 , the Connecticut native went from being a fun-loving high school star to a well-paid tight end for the Super Bowl-minded Patriots , only to end up committing suicide in prison after being convicted of one Boston-area murder and heavily implicated in two others . Members of Hernandez 's family declined to participate in the series , the executive producers of which are a pair of sportswriters , Dan Wetzel and Kevin Armstrong , who appear frequently in the episodes to recount events . Hernandez can be heard speaking with a number of people close to him , including his mother and his fiancee , in phone conversations recorded while he was in a Bristol County -LRB- Connecticut -RRB- jail . In addition , the series features commentary from childhood friends , law enforcement and prison officials , defense attorneys , journalists and Patriots teammates . Here are the eight most striking details that emerged from `` Killer Inside : The Mind of Aaron Hernandez . '' - - - His high school quarterback said they were in a sexual relationship As with many other aspects of the series , those who followed Hernandez 's saga closely or who happened to catch a relevant headline may already have been familiar with the claims made by Dennis SanSoucie , his quarterback and close friend at Bristol Central High . Those unfamiliar with the claims , however , may well be taken aback to hear SanSoucie say they `` experimented '' sexually . `` We continued because we probably enjoyed it . `` Yes , we were in a relationship back then , '' SanSoucie tells the camera , `` but at the time , you do n't look at it like that . '' Elsewhere in the series , SanSoucie says that when news emerged that Hernandez may have had a lover in prison , his father scoffed and declared that there was no way the stud athlete he knew could be gay . SanSoucie said it took him months after that before he `` broke the news '' about himself and Hernandez . SanSoucie 's father , Tim , sits next to his son and says at one point that he was `` homophobic '' years ago , just as Hernandez 's father was . `` Aaron was extremely terrified of his father finding out , '' Dennis SanSoucie adds . `` I mean , Mr. Hernandez was well known as a man 's man , a father that slapped the -LSB- gay slur -RSB- right out of you . '' While the series is understandably incapable of fully explaining what drove Hernandez to forfeit his lucrative athletic career in favor of the criminality that eventually led to at least one homicide , `` Killer Inside '' posits at several points that his discomfort with his sexual inclinations , or at least the way they might be viewed by others , manifested itself in angry and occasionally violent outbursts . Other potential factors , such as his brain being posthumously discovered with a stunningly advanced case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy -LRB- CTE -RRB- , as well as his father 's abrupt death when he was 16 , are also explored . Yet the possibility that Hernandez was homosexual or bisexual is consistently raised in the series , including by former Patriots offensive lineman Ryan O'Callaghan , who came out as gay after his NFL career ended in 2011 .", "url": "https://m.sfgate.com/news/article/The-eight-most-striking-details-from-the-Aaron-14979029.php", "kws": ["Aaron^^Hernandez", "Mr.^^Hernandez", "Netflix", "star", "episodes", "Kevin^^Armstrong", "Dan^^Wetzel", "NFL", "Boston", "Patriots^^teammates", "quarterback", "prison", "Patriots", "Dennis^^SanSoucie", "news", "defense^^attorneys", "jail", "attorneys", "commentary", "Connecticut"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 0.5834741592407227, "CrimePublicsafety": 0.7657617926597595, "Sports": 0.9608937501907349}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Other": 0.5834741592407227, "Sports_Other": 0.9608937501907349, "CrimePublicsafety_Other": 0.7657617926597595}}}

A few moments ago , the Knox County Sheriffs Office forwarded me the 2nd supplement . This from a visit on Friday January 10th by both KCSO and the TN Department of Agriculture TN Special Agent/Investigator for the Agricultural Crime Unit . On Friday , January 10 , 2020 I was escorting Tennessee Department of Agriculture Special Agent / Investigator for the Agricultural Crime Unit -LRB- Agent R. Raper -RRB- to the property for a follow up . Agent Raper is concerned the deceased cow and calf are not deep enough in the ground , the large white bull and the small black bull are digging with their front legs -LRB- feet -RRB- and heads to attempt to dig her up . He is concerned with the number of new calves -LRB- approximately 7 on each side of the road -RRB- . He noticed 1 calf attempting to nurse and as the calf would make the attempt it would head butt the utters . Agent Raper advises that is a sign the mother is not producing colostrum and milk . He explains colostrum is a necessity for calves when they are 1st born . He is unsure if the calves will survive with the conditions of the mother cows . In videos , all cows have diarrhea streaming from their rear ends . He states this can be from a number of intestinal virus ' and bacteria . He also noticed a cough and mucus from the cows , he advised this could be BRD -LRB- Bovine Respiratory Disease -RRB- which is common in sickly cows and is highly contagious in a herd . Cows were noticed drinking from water standing in feces . No potable water has been placed for the cattle as he instructed Mr McMillan to put out for the cows . He looked at the hay advising , the hay is considered a filler hay and is n't nutrient sufficient enough to sustain the cattle . He advises the cattle need alfalfa hay and high protein grain , but was concerned of the shock it would place on their system if just placed in the pasture and recommends a feeding plan be put into effect by a UT Ag Extension or a Veterinarian . He states all cows need vet care , worming blocks , mineral blocks and protein blocks . He advised there are too many cows in the pasture since the pasture is not being turned properly and the grazing ground is baron . He states the cattle should not be sold for Human Consumption and does not think they will pass the FDA inspection . He added , if the cows are treated by a veterinarian and have been cleared by a veterinarian they may be considered for Human Consumption at that time . Mr Glyn Underwood has stepped forward and has been requested to be placed on the report as a witness . He advises , he has watched this go on for years and is concerned for the animals and the safety of the public due to the cattle getting out and the danger it places in the roadway along with the spread of disease the cattle carry that may be contagious to animals and humans alike . He advises several have died and numerous complaints have been made with no action against Mr McMillan .

0.0	{"docid": "0NrrAcnO", "title": "` Homeland ' Declassified : Battles , Backlash , CIA Meetings and a Secret Call With Edward Snowden", "content": "`` What keeps you up at night ? '' That 's the question Homeland showrunner Alex Gansa annually posed to Washington insiders before putting fingers to keyboard on a season of his Emmy-winning Showtime drama . What began as a slick spy thriller driven by a potent sexual chemistry , courtesy of leads Claire Danes and Damian Lewis , evolved into an expos\u00e9 on the greatest dangers to an America that finally had some distance from 9/11 . Threats from ISIS , the surveillance state and Russian interference punctuated clandestine meetings with the intelligence community -- part of a yearly writers and cast symposium in D.C. affectionately dubbed `` Spy Camp . '' The series , loosely developed from an Israeli format by Gansa and longtime collaborator Howard Gordon -LRB- 24 -RRB- , became an instant and bona fide success when it premiered in 2011 to 2.8 million viewers and unanimous critical acclaim . Boasting a murderers ' row of writers , each a showrunner at one time , the drama catapulted Showtime and studio Fox 21 to an echelon of prestige TV they previously could n't reach . It swept its first Emmys -LRB- with six awards total -RRB- and those first seasons had both the Obamas and Clintons soliciting screeners . In Hollywood , efforts to capitalize on its early success were dubbed `` the Homeland effect . '' And despite years of would-be copycats following suit on broadcast and cable , few captured even a sliver of zeitgeist or lasted more than a single season . Indeed , Homeland briefly seized the industry 's and viewers ' attention in a way that only Game of Thrones has since -- a feat that now seems virtually impossible in an era with nearly 500 scripted U.S. series airing each year . As the drama is set to premiere its eighth and final season Feb. 9 , Gansa , Gordon , Danes and those closest to the series look back on the show 's legacy and reveal previously untold stories behind their landmark hit -- including the battles to hire -LRB- then let go of -RRB- Lewis , a secret call with Edward Snowden , how the 2015 Paris attacks forced everyone to reassess the series ' portrayal of the Muslim world and why the last batch of episodes , where Danes ' character is now suspected of being a double agent , echoes the first . Claire Danes was photographed Nov. 20 at Milk Studios in New York City . PART I : Former writing partners Alex Gansa and Howard Gordon , reunited on the last seasons of Fox 's 24 , option an Israeli format about two freed prisoners of war and recast it as an exploration of America 's place in the world a decade after 9/11 . ALEX GANSA -LRB- CO-CREATOR , SHOWRUNNER -RRB- This was unfinished business . Howard and I had always wanted to do our own show . HOWARD GORDON -LRB- CO-CREATOR -RRB- We split up as writing partners in our 20s , during the first season of The X-Files . We stayed friends , but we just were n't seeing a lot of each other . GANSA And 15 years later , I was on a train on my way out of the business . Howard rescued me from literal poverty and let me come on 24 for the last two years . GORDON In the middle of the last season , -LSB- agent -RSB- Rick Rosen , who represents -LSB- Israeli studio -RSB- Keshet , came back from a trip to Israel , calls me and says , `` I have your next show . '' RICK ROSEN -LRB- AGENT -RRB- I 'd gone to lunch with Avi Nir , the chairman of Keshet , and he says to me , `` This writer , Gideon Raff , pitched me this show called Hatufim '' -- which translates to Prisoners of War . He asked , `` Do you think that type of show would work in the States ? '' I said , `` Absolutely , and I have the writer . '' GORDON It had n't been shot . It had only been written , so we had 10 episodes translated to English . -LSB- 20th Century -RSB- Fox agreed to buy the underlying property , so we could adapt it . In Hatufim , there was no Carrie , no Saul . It was really about two soldiers . DANA WALDEN -LRB- THEN-CHAIRMAN OF 20TH CENTURY FOX TV -RRB- Alex and Howard became taken with this idea of what happens if a prisoner of war has turned . GANSA We completely devoted ourselves to writing the pilot for six months . But this was almost 10 years after 9/11 , so there was a fear among everybody -- the studio , the writers , the agencies -- that no one would be interested in this story . And Dana did n't want another 24 . GORDON But she really wanted it to go to Fox . ROSEN Kevin -LSB- Reilly -RSB- , who was running Fox at the time , walks in with the script in his hand and just tosses it on the conference table and goes , `` I have no notes . It 's kind of perfect . However , if you 're going to do this here , you really need to pump up the volume on this show . '' And the guys basically said , `` We did that show , and we 're not doing that show again . '' WALDEN We had imagined a smooth path onto the air at -LSB- Fox -RSB- , so Kevin passing was a bit of a setback . But there were so many choices for viewers , even then , that asking audiences to make a weekly serialized commitment on broadcast was getting harder and harder . NBC passed for similar reasons . GORDON And then FX passed . They thought Damages had been problematic because it was a serialized , but David Nevins had just started at Showtime . DAVID NEVINS -LRB- THEN-PRESIDENT OF ENTERTAINMENT AT SHOWTIME -RRB- The first couple days on the job , Rick slipped the script to me . ROSEN That was on a Friday . On Saturday , David is on the phone saying to me , `` If you give me this show , I 'll order it to pilot right now . '' I said , `` How can you do that ? Have you already spoken to Les -LSB- Moonves -RSB- ? '' He said , `` I have Les ' backing . I 'm ordering it . '' BERT SALKE -LRB- PRESIDENT , FOX 21TELEVISION STUDIOS -RRB- David was really aggressive and went for it in a way I do n't think anyone had ever seen him do before . GARY LEVINE -LRB- THEN-EXEC VP ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING AT SHOWTIME -RRB- He was rabid for it . NEVINS I had to sell Dana and -LSB- then-partner -RSB- Gary -LSB- Newman -RSB- , so my pitch from the beginning was we 'd get it on the air for the 10th anniversary of 9/11 , and Dexter , our No. 1 show at the time , would be its lead-in . But I had one big note : Carrie Mathison felt too Jack Bauer . We discussed how we were going to make her a more complicated , less reliable character . GANSA Carrie was n't bipolar in that draft . NEVINS It 's not that I did n't want to make her reliable to the audience . I wanted to make her less reliable to the authorities . LEVINE Our job was to make it belong on premium cable . Having just come off of 24 , their spec -- which was great -- had a lot of plot twists . We needed the character turns to be as surprising as the plot . GANSA They did an amazing job pushing us to make this character more vivid , but they were also attached to their model of casting movie stars who were on the tail end of their career . NEVINS It 'd be impolitic to mention names . GANSA They were pushing for Robin Wright or Halle Berry or Maria Bello , who were all already in their 40s . SALKE Halle Berry was the big deal , and a lot of that was being driven by the network . GANSA By the time you 're in your mid-40s and you 've got bipolar illness for that long , everything is calcified . ROSEN I 'd been looking for a project for Claire Danes in television for a while . CLAIRE DANES -LRB- CARRIE MATHISON -RRB- I had just done -LSB- HBO 's Emmy-winning miniseries -RSB- Temple Grandin , and I felt charged up to do something similarly thrilling and scary . There just was n't much available . `` I had just done -LSB- HBO 's Emmy-winning miniseries -RSB- Temple Grandin , and I felt charged up to do something similarly thrilling and scary , '' Danes said . NEVINS You did n't want to stop and think too much about the math of how old she was on 9/11 -LSB- 22 -RSB- , but you also do n't question the range of Claire Danes , so that was not a hard call . GORDON And we had called the character Claire in the first 16 drafts . DANES I still do n't quite know how to take that . GANSA Sunday in the Park With George in the '80s with Bernadette Peters and Mandy Patinkin , and it changed my life . But Mandy had such a sterling reputation ... LEVINE Mandy had balked at every other show he 's ever been on . If he had a long-term contract , he would get antsy and bail -- including on one of ours , Dead Like Me . MANDY PATINKIN -LRB- SAUL BERENSON -RRB- I thought they were all crazy to hire me , given my track record . I never thought I 'd work in television again after my last experience -LSB- on Criminal Minds -RSB- . -LSB- Disturbed by the CBS show 's content , he went AWOL after its second season . -RSB- SALKE He 's a beautiful soul . But , yes , I personally got a number of very firm calls asking , `` Do you know what you 're getting into ? '' LEVINE We wanted him in the role , so we decided not to offer him a long-term contract , just a two-year deal in hopes that he would love it enough to keep re-upping . PATINKIN They offered me a one-year contract . It 's the only way I 'd do it . But from day one , I 'd never been happier on a film or television job -- except maybe The Princess Bride . DANES When Mandy and I did the read-through for the pilot , the chemistry was so strong , so immediate , I was really startled by it . He also bears an uncanny resemblance to my best friend 's dad . GANSA There was the Claire battle , the Mandy battle and then the Damian Lewis battle . There was tremendous resistance to casting him as Brody . `` I 'd been looking for a project for Claire Danes in television for a while , '' said agent Rick Rosen . SALKE Alex initially pushed for Damian , but people did n't see it . Life , on NBC , had just finished . It was n't everyone 's favorite show . DAMIAN LEWIS -LRB- NICHOLAS BRODY -RRB- Life was terrific , but it was kiboshed by the writers strike . After that , I was told I looked like a guy who 'd led a show that only lasted two seasons . DANES They were thinking of somebody else who I did n't think was right for it . GANSA Ryan Phillippe came up . Also Kyle Chandler ... GORDON Then I flew to New York on a red-eye to meet Alessandro Nivola -LSB- A Most Violent Year -RSB- , who famously said no to everything . He turned down Dexter . GANSA Howard failed that mission -LSB- with Nivola -RSB- , so we were three weeks away from shooting the pilot , and we did not have a Brody yet -- and we 're still in the `` Damian Lewis will never play this role , please do not bring him up ever again '' phase . NEVINS I did n't really know Damian . GANSA Then I remembered -LSB- pilot director -RSB- Michael Cuesta had told me to watch this movie Damian did called Keane . LEWIS About five people saw it , but it was the best reviewed movie I 've ever been in . GORDON Alex called me at 10:30 that night and told me I had to watch it . I was blown away . GANSA The next morning we sent it to all the people who said , `` This guy is a dead issue , '' and , to their credit , they watched it and said , `` This is the guy . '' Also , we had nobody else ... `` I 'm watching Claire and Mandy in their very first scene together on the monitor -- wondering if we 're going to believe this mentor/protege relationship or even buy them as CIA officers . Within the first 20 seconds , I knew we had a show , '' said Homeland co-creator and showrunner Alex Gansa . MICHAEL CUESTA -LRB- DIRECTOR-PRODUCER -RRB- I came on board to direct the pilot when Ben Affleck fell out . The shoot in Charlotte went smoothly , but for the part in Israel I 'd scouted Barta'a on the West Bank for this big traffic jam -LSB- scene -RSB- . We closed the street and apparently paid off merchants on the wrong side of the street . Fights broke out . People picked up rocks . We got the hell out . GANSA You start a pilot not knowing whether you have a show or not . But on the second or third day , it 's freezing cold and I 'm watching Claire and Mandy in their very first scene together on the monitor -- wondering if we 're going to believe this mentor/protege relationship or even buy them as CIA officers . Within the first 20 seconds , I knew we had a show . CUESTA Then Osama bin Laden was killed , and it was clear we were getting a series pickup . PART II : Homeland marks Showtime 's most watched premiere in nearly a decade with 2.8 million viewers . A hit in Hollywood and Washington , it 's suddenly the most talked-about show in America , but the battle over what to do with Lewis ' character casts a pall over the second and third seasons . NEVINS It was a very well-made pilot , but I did n't have much expectation other than knowing the show was good . MEREDITH STIEHM -LRB- WRITER -RRB- They did not have a female writer , so I came on after the fourth episode . It was just Alex , Howard , Chip Johannessen -LSB- Dexter -RSB- , Henry Bromell -LSB- Brotherhood -RSB- , Alex Cary -LSB- Lie to Me -RSB- and me that first season . SALKE Each of them had been showrunners . It began the trend of all-star writing staffs . STIEHM Some people called it a murderers ' row , but I thought we were more of a really cool band that lasted two years . GANSA After the reviews , we took over the entertainment world for a time . Steven Spielberg would call for DVDs . WALDEN People in the highest levels of government , of entertainment , of business in general , were calling . Within a two-week period , the Obama administration and Secretary Clinton 's office called for early cuts of Homeland . The number of times in my career that has happened would be exactly one . `` When I had my last scene with Mandy , I sort of lost it , '' says Danes -LRB- with Patinkin in season one -RRB- , `` in a cathartic , good way . '' DANES Three episodes in , people were literally running out of stores , charging me with enthusiasm . I 'd never experienced that before . My So-Called Life had this amazingly rich afterlife , but there was n't that appreciation as it was airing . GANSA Damian went to the White House . LEWIS Donald Trump and others on the right were peddling this idea that Obama was born in Kenya , so I had this season-one DVD and , tongue in cheek , I wrote him a note . GANSA It read , `` From one Muslim to another . '' LEWIS It was a very British thing to do , but it festered . Two weeks later , I emailed -LSB- White House Press Secretary -RSB- Jay Carney , `` Please tell me that the president got my joke ! '' Jay said , `` Yeah , he got it . Everything 's cool . '' ROSEN I was at some ridiculous dinner where Obama goes from table to table , and his aide is whispering in his ear who everyone is . When he gets to me , Obama looks at me and goes , `` You 're involved in Homeland ? On Saturdays , Michelle goes to play tennis with the girls and I tell her I 'm going down to the office to work . What I 'm really doing is watching Homeland DVDs . '' LEVINE A meeting was arranged between the cast , the network and the CIA at Langley . They confiscated our cellphones , and our whole team is just sitting there across from maybe 50 CIA agents . NEVINS John Brennan , who was running the CIA at the time , came out in the middle and says , `` I do n't know what your show is , but I know it matters to my people . '' LEVINE Then he grabbed Mandy and said , `` Hey , do you want to see your office ? '' GANSA They talked about how similar our professions were -- it 's a lot of acting , storytelling and feigned intimacy . DANES There were parodies on Saturday Night Live and in MAD magazine . That 's a real sign that you 've made it , getting roasted . There was a porn made about us . Homeland blew every other drama out of the water at the 2012 Emmys , with acting trophies for Danes and Lewis , a writing win for Gansa and Gordon , and a best drama victory that toppled long-standing champ Mad Men . NEVINS One of the most memorable experiences coming out of the show was that first Emmy night . WALDEN I was so overwhelmed that night . I just kept hearing them name the show . GANSA It was very funny seeing those guys -LSB- John Landgraf and Kevin Reilly -RSB- at the Emmys that year . They just looked at me and shook their heads . SALKE Everybody bemoans turning down Homeland -- no one more than Kevin Reilly . ROSEN My dear friends at HBO were not entirely pleased with me , to put it very mildly , that they did n't get a shot . PATINKIN I had never seen anything like that first season . But nothing is ever like the first time . It 's never that good again . The art of living is trying to keep it good enough . NEVINS Brody was intended to be just a few episodes -- but , from the very first script , I said no . We started tinkering with the relationship . GANSA It was so clear after the first season that there was still story to tell . And the relationship between the two of them in the most unexpected way had become front and center . SALKE You did n't know if you 're watching for Brody or Carrie , but you were definitely watching for both of them . It was so fucking compelling . GORDON Chemistry , whatever that is , they had it . LEWIS My understanding was always two years . Halfway through season two , having not explicitly said they were killing Brody , they gave Nevins the breakdown : `` And this is when Brody dies . '' Nevins was like , `` No , no , no . Brody 's not dying . '' GANSA I do n't know that they were having conversations . They were just on their knees , begging not to get rid of Damian . WALDEN They contemplated every conceivable scenario of what happens to the show with him , what happens to the show without him . CHIP JOHANNESSEN -LRB- WRITER -RRB- At that point , -LSB- keeping him -RSB- was not a decision we made . It was a decision that was made for us and we adapted to it . LEWIS When the critics started saying the show lost its port , I think it 's because the guys had to reimagine and rewrite it just to keep me going . NEVINS We got hammered on things that we did n't deserve to be hammered on . GANSA By season three , the story was running out of steam . PATINKIN I think they kept the Brody story going a year too long . LEWIS I was n't in every episode that last season , and that confused people . Brody was a problem . You could n't keep flip-flopping . `` Are they going to kill each other or fuck each other ? '' was interesting for a while . DANES We always knew that that was a finite relationship . GORDON But we 'd baked him into the fabric of the thing . WALDEN Finally losing Brody , that conversation made me a little sick to my stomach . GANSA There would have been something braver about ending his story sooner . But season three proved so difficult on so many fronts . Henry Bromell died -LSB- of a heart attack in 2013 -RSB- , and we were getting rid of Damian even though he and Claire had the most incredible thing . DANES Alex is actually a really good surfer , which is kind of the best metaphor for television . You 're riding this wave , and you do n't really know where it 's going to take you exactly . GANSA The praise and the criticism are both overstated . We should n't have gotten that much praise in the beginning . And where we got criticism , from people who did n't want to watch the show after Brody died or from whatever backlash we had when Quinn -LSB- Rupert Friend -RSB- died , it 's because people start becoming proprietary about the characters once you 've been on the air long enough . RUPERT FRIEND -LRB- PETER QUINN -RRB- If I remember right , he 'd been gassed and in a coma . Alex said , `` Well , this has been great , thanks a lot . Bye . '' Then , a year later , I got an equally matter-of-fact , `` Actually , you 're not dead . '' Then he really died . JOHANNESSEN It took me a while to warm up to Rupert ... Friend 's character , Peter Quinn -LRB- with Mehdi Nebbou , sitting , as Hussein -RRB- , died not once but twice on the series . GANSA There was a lot happening behind the scenes that I 'm not at liberty to share . JOHANNESSEN But by the time he is apparently dead at the end of season five , we all adored him . Bringing him back -LSB- briefly -RSB- in season six was driven by some unfinished stuff between Quinn and Carrie . SALKE There are viewers , especially women , who liked Quinn more than Brody . FRIEND Lesli Linka Glatter -LSB- director/producer -RSB- once told me he 's kind of a perfect man -- to which I said , `` Lesli , he kills people for money . '' DANES A lot of people died on this show , especially if they ever made out with Carrie Mathison . PART III : Without Lewis , Homeland re-centers on Danes ' erratic case officer and moves production abroad to Berlin and Cape Town -LRB- subbing for Pakistan -RRB- , as the series becomes more informed by meetings with A-list intelligence experts . GANSA We were always very interested in what was being said and discussed in the halls of power in Washington , not just at the CIA but the White House , the State Department and in the Washington Post press room . That began to inform us more after season three . Without Brody , we had to pick an idea to talk about over a season . That 's when Spy Camp became really important . STIEHM The writers would meet in January , knowing we had to shoot by June , but we never knew what the story was going to be . D.C. was really a fishing expedition . JOHN MCGAFFIN -LRB- FORMER CIA OFFICER -RRB- Henry Bromell , my cousin , had started calling me and asking , `` John , what would happen if ... ? '' After Henry died , Alex called and asked if I 'd still be willing to help out . GORDON We 'd already been turned down by the military , which was so cooperative on 24 . They wanted nothing to do with a show about a soldier who came home a terrorist . We found that out when Michael Klick , one of our producers , needed some sort of helicopter or something -- and they were like , `` No fucking way . '' MCGAFFIN The show was greatly popular with intelligence officials , and they became increasingly eager to help us . So I made arrangements with the City Tavern Club , one of the oldest private clubs in Georgetown that a lot of former CIA people frequent , that we would take over the top floor for a week . GANSA The day would start at 8 a.m. , and it would often end after 10 p.m. . It was this old place with rickety chairs and the same food all the time . GORDON Oh God , it 's so disgusting ... soggy . But the level of people you would not believe -- and they 'd come for two hours , two intense hours . MCGAFFIN Former CIA people , ambassadors , ex-military , journalists , intelligence officers of all kinds would sit down with the writers , Lesli , Alex , Howard , Mandy and Claire . And every source who came in , I told them they were there to answer this question : `` What are the national security issues likely to bite the security establishment in the ass over the coming year ? '' GANSA The first thing we got was a litany of everything we got wrong : `` We do n't talk on our cellphones . We do n't operate on American soil . Carrie would have to take blood tests , so the medication would come up . '' But we got the spirit right , and that 's what they appreciated . PATINKIN Every year , every individual echoed the same concerns , and it really started setting the tone for each season . DANES It was an avalanche of unsettling information . LESLI LINKA GLATTER -LRB- DIRECTOR/PRODUCER -RRB- We had Gen. Michael Hayden , the guy in the Iraq War doing rendition , black sites and enhanced torture techniques -- so , to me , he was the devil -- booked back-to-back with Dana Priest , who won the Pulitzer Prize for writing the book that exposed rendition , black sites and enhanced torture techniques . GANSA We had to figure out a way to usher Hayden down one set of stairs and Priest up another set of stairs because you did n't want them to run into each other . There was so much hostility . MCGAFFIN We arranged a Skype call once with two senior Mossad officers in Tel Aviv and had a long discussion about spy work with Iranians . GLATTER And any time we had a new actor who played a spy , Alex and I talked to them about what it means to be a spy . We had this one guy , and we 're going on and on , and he interrupts and says , `` I 'm so sorry , I really need to stop you . I was in Mossad . '' GANSA Bart Gellman , this Pulitzer Prize winner who wrote the Cheney book -LSB- Angler : The Cheney Vice Presidency -RSB- , told me he was going to bring a guest . He shows up with his laptop , sets it up , dials a number or whatever , and the next thing we know , we 're talking to Ed Snowden in Moscow . Very odd guy . But this is before he was doing any talking to anybody . PATINKIN You knew everyone at the CIA , the FBI and the GRU in Russia were listening in . You just knew it . I tried my butt off to get him to talk about personal stuff , but we could n't budge him from his soapbox . MCGAFFIN I did n't want to be identified , so I kept sliding Alex notes . I had him say , `` There 's a senior intelligence officer here , and he thinks he knows what 's going to happen to you . '' Snowden is all , `` What do you mean ? '' And I made Alex say , `` Sooner or later , when they 've gotten everything out of you , Putin is going to have you killed and make it look like the Americans did it . '' I hope he did n't sleep for weeks . GLATTER To make sure I got shoots correct , I looked up the most incendiary videos -- public hangings in Tehran , how to emigrate to ISIS , jihadi videos , beheadings . And I downloaded it on my home computer , like an idiot , and now I get strip searched every time I go through Heathrow . MCGAFFIN Another Spy Camp , I told everybody coming that their job was to make the writers understand how serious the threat of Russian election interference was . We did a whole season -LSB- season six -RSB- about that before anyone was talking about it . GLATTER That 's when I thought we jumped the shark . Then , of course , by the time we were airing it , that 's exactly what was going on in the news . GANSA When Trump was elected , all of the sudden we did n't have to bring these people in through separate entrances . The press and the `` deep state , '' if you want to call it that , were both really freaked out by this president . GLATTER Our advisers said that every president-elect who comes in for their first intelligence briefing leaves overwhelmed by the enormity of the task . They thought they understood what was going on in the world , but when you 're told what 's happening on a classified level , they realize how big the job is . That did not happen with Trump . JOHANNESSEN There was all of this Trump stuff we heard about -- Russian connections , the laundering of money into his places in Florida . Some of it became public during the -LSB- James -RSB- Comey stuff , but a lot of it did n't , and you 're sitting there wondering , `` Why not ? '' GANSA One thing that we learned is that you keep American foreign policy consistent from one administration to the next . The worst thing you can do is to backtrack , like to say no to the Climate Change Agreement or the Iran treaty . That is anathema for the intelligence community because it rocks the boat . It makes nobody trust us abroad . PART IV : Accused of peddling Islamophobia throughout its run , several events during production of the fifth season prompt Gansa and company to take a look at their portrayal of the Muslim world . GANSA During season five , I woke up at 4:30 in the morning to a panicked call from Germany . We 'd been punched by a bunch of German-Muslim artists we 'd hired to do the graffiti for our refugee camp set . Some of it , in Arabic , said stuff like `` Homeland is racist '' and `` Homeland is a watermelon . '' GORDON There was a central irony -LSB- to that response -RSB- . In the reductive way that people would say 24 was just executing talking points for George W. Bush and Roger Ailes , a similarly reductive assessment of Homeland is that it 's an answer , an apology or more nuanced story -- which it is . GANSA I thought , `` This is the greatest thing that could have happened . We are now going to become the center of a conversation about how America 's power is being discussed . '' GORDON We did go to great lengths to portray Muslim characters who had a broad range of views about the world . PATINKIN That 's been uncomfortable for all of us , the othering aspect . GANSA Then the worst thing that could have possibly happened did . I was on the plane , going to Germany to film a terrorist attack on a Berlin train station when the -LSB- 2015 -RSB- Paris attacks happened . That was the lowest point of the show for me . DANES There was always some parallel like that -- but the bombings and shootings in Paris , that 's what made me jumpy . I did n't know that were were always going to be mirroring current events so directly , that that would be such a part of the DNA of the show . GANSA So it 's just days later , and we were down in this abandoned subway with a bunch of Muslim actors wondering what the fuck we were doing . GLATTER We talked about it , had a moment for the people who had been lost . It was very important for everyone to be aware and take care of one another . GANSA Because the actors were like , `` Why are we doing this ? Are we perpetrating the stereotypes ? '' Even though the hero of that particular story was a Muslim guy who stopped the attack , it was happening right next door , and it was still so raw . PATINKIN I 'm not an idiot . I know terrorism and violence sells . That 's never going to change . I just want to bring the narrative of the polar opposite to at least move to a halfway point . GANSA If I had it to do all over again , knowing what had happened in Paris , we would 've told a different story -- but we were at a point where there was no turning back . But it did really influence the next three seasons because we came back to the States . GORDON And if anything , you showed the rot inside -LSB- America -RSB- from that hyper correction . PATINKIN This is a novel , this television series . Certainly , there are chapters that are n't helpful to one group or another -- and there was pushback on that , to say the least . But there was also a lot of care taken to make other people the bad guys -- white guys , the government , the CIA . But they did n't get as much attention as the terrorists . GANSA We 're now deconstructing the authorship of things . Sometimes , I 'm like , `` Do we have the right to write this ? '' I really do n't know . But if we started this show today ... GORDON Oh , we 'd be pilloried ! Pilloried ! Gordon accepted the best drama series Golden Globe in 2012 . PART V : Despite pleas from Showtime to continue , producers agree to an endgame for Homeland with a three-season renewal in 2016 . After several delays , in part because of Danes ' pregnancy and a lengthy Morocco shoot , the final season sends the story back to the Middle East . GORDON Ending the show ? It was a very short conversation . NEVINS It was a triangular negotiation between what the producers wanted , what the studio wanted and what we wanted . Alex really wanted to write to an end point . GANSA The economics of it were so strong that we all decided we could tell three more seasons . And frankly , the advent of Donald Trump really gave us fresh wind in our sails . SALKE The show demanded money based on how big of a production it became . -LSB- In its final season , Homeland 's budget swelled to more than double the first season 's $ 3 million per-episode price tag . Danes alone was making north of $ 500,000 an episode . -RSB- When Alex and Howard want to shoot the final season in the Middle East , you 're not doing it in Barstow . You 're going to Morocco . GANSA We thought we 'd go and tell one last story about Carrie Mathison doing what she was trained to do , serve as a case officer overseas . So , we went back abroad one more time . Production on the final season sent Patinkin and Danes to Casablanca , doubling for Kabul . GLATTER We were told we had full Moroccan military support . So , in one scene we had two C130 -LSB- aircrafts -RSB- and a bunch of Humvees and helicopters as set dressing . All of a sudden , we get a bill for $ 230,000 . DANES We actually did the last days in Northridge , California . So the last shot , we 're filming in L.A. -LSB- in October -RSB- with raging fires . We should not have been filming , but we did n't have a choice . The crew was wearing masks . Of course , we 're ending this show in an inferno . GANSA Really , the entire run of the show has asked , `` Did America overreact to 9/11 ? Did we compromise our values ? Did we overreach ? '' I do n't think the world has found an answer . DANES We were so much about reflecting what was happening , politically , in the moment . How that ages , how we perceived it and what that exposes , in 10 years ' time , will be compelling to see . NEVINS You ca n't get to a finale of a long-running show without answering the dreaded -LSB- spinoff -RSB- question ... GANSA Every time Howard brings up doing more , I want to punch him . GORDON I 'm really just doing it to irritate him , but never say never . GANSA Howard gave his 40s to 24 . I gave my 50s to Homeland . And it got to a point where everyone wants to do something different . DANES I need this last season released into the world before it really ends for me , and then I 'm sure I 'll surface eventually . It 's going to be a long process of seeing who I am as an actor out of this show -- which has defined me for so long . I do n't know where to start , but I should play somebody decidedly sane . *** Who 's Who at Homeland 's `` Spy Camp '' The helpful experts -- at least those who can be revealed -- included generals , Pulitzer winners and an exiled whistleblower A. ELIZABETH JONES A foreign service officer for more than 35 years , Jones worked for the State Department in Kabul , Cairo , Amman , Baghdad and Berlin . `` Watching the impeachment hearings , '' says Glatter , `` she 'd literally be sitting right there in the gallery . Oh , that 's Beth . '' STANLEY A. MCCHRYSTAL A retired Army general who was once the head of the Joint Special Operations Command , at one point McChrystal was responsible for leading all U.S. forces in Afghanistan . He now teaches international relations at Yale University . DANA PRIEST The longtime Washington Post correspondent has two Pulitzer Prizes , including one for her beat reporting on the more incendiary features of the U.S. government 's counterterrorism campaign abroad -- including brutal interrogation techniques . EDWARD SNOWDEN Washington Post writer Bart Gellman , who ran point on coverage of Snowden 's release of top-secret documents , put the exiled former NSA contractor on an hours-long Spy Camp call before he appeared in a documentary or started giving interviews . MICHAEL HAYDEN Overseeing the NSA 's creation of domestic wiretaps during the George W. Bush administration , among other controversial moves , the onetime CIA director has since distanced himself from many conservative allies with his Trump criticism . *** Homeland : By the Numbers 7M : Weekly audience for its most watched season , No. 3 , across platforms 200 + : Territories across the globe that have licensed the series 8 : Emmy Wins , including two for Danes , out of 39 nominations 6 : Countries where the series filmed over its eight-season run 3 : AFI Awards for best television program -LRB- 2011 , 2012 and 2015 -RRB- 1 : Peabody Award for the series ' first season in 2011 Canceled , Renewed or Ending : Your favorite show 's fate -LRB- via Photo Services -RRB- 1/89 SLIDES \u00a9 Danielle Levitt ` Awkwafina Is Nora From Queens ' -LRB- Comedy Central -RRB- : Renewed for season 2 This story first appeared in the Jan. 16 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine .

0.0	{"docid": "0Nrs7kdR", "title": "On Stage : ` The Band Visits ' at Kimmel", "content": "Two of the most highly acclaimed new musicals visiting Philadelphia as part of the Kimmel Center 's Broadway Philadelphia 's 2019-2020 season have a major similarity . They are about strangers in another land -- people who have inadvertently been stranded far from home . The shows are `` Come From Away , '' which recently had a run in Philly and `` The Band 's Visit , '' which is running now through January 19 at the Academy of Music -LRB- Broad and Locust streets , Philadelphia , 215-731-3333 , www.kimmelcenter.org -RRB- . `` Come From Away '' is set in Newfoundland , Canada and features a relatively homogeneous group of characters -- North Americans who were stranded in the Maritime province when flights were rerouted during the 911 crisis . `` The Band 's Visit '' is set in a `` mythical '' Israeli town and features two very diverse groups of characters -- local Jewish townspeople and an Egyptian Police Band that ended up there by mistake . It 's a story of Jews and Arabs getting `` up close and personal . '' `` The Band 's Visit '' is a stage musical with music and lyrics by David Yazbek and a book by Itamar Moses , based on the 2007 Israeli film of the same name . The musical opened on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in November 2017 , after its off-Broadway premiere at the Atlantic Theater Company in December 2016 . The Off-Broadway production of `` The Band 's Visit '' won several major awards , including the 2017 Obie Award for Musical Theatre , as well the year 's New York Drama Critics ' Circle Award for Best Musical . At the 72nd Tony Awards , the show was nominated for 11 awards and won 10 -- including Best Musical . `` The Band 's Visit '' is one of four musicals in Broadway history to win the unofficial `` Big Six '' Tony Awards , which include Best Musical , Best Book , Best Score , Best Actor in a Musical , Best Actress in a Musical , and Best Direction of a Musical . It also won the 2019 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album . The play takes place over the course of one evening in the tiny desert town of Bet Hatikva , Israel . The Egyptian Police Band was actually bound for the similarly named town of Petah Tikvah . The Egyptian Police Band arrives in Israel to play a concert . After a mix-up at the border , it is sent to a remote village in the middle of the desert . With no bus until morning and no hotel in sight , the unfortunate travelers are taken in by the locals . Under the spell of the desert sky , their lives become intertwined in the most unexpected ways . The cast of the National Tour features Sasson Gabai as Tewfiq Zakaria , Chilina Kennedy as Dina , Pomme Koch as Itzik , Adam Gabai as Papi , Or Schraiber as Zelger and Marc Ginsburg as Sammy . Ginsburg is an area native who graduated from Bensalem High . `` I did n't know much about the show other than I had heard a lot about ot and listened to the original soundtrack , '' said Ginsburg , during a recent phone interview . `` When I heard that I had an audition , I watched the movie . I auditioned initially in February 2019 . I 'm based in L.A. I had a relationship with Rubin Casting and they thought I 'd be a decent fit . `` They asked me for a video audition . They sent me a scene and a song . I did n't hear anything for about a month and then they called e to come to New York . `` I worked with a friend who helped me with the Israeli language . And I also worked with a vocal coach . I auditioned in New York and got a call two days later . That was in late March and rehearsals started in mid-May . `` Now , I 'm on the road with the tour . I have a wife and a three-and-a-half-year-old son and we live in Encino -LRB- CA -RRB- . I did n't want to leave them there , so they came with me on the tour . '' Bet Hatikva is a rural town where the residents bemoan the boring and monotonous lives they lead in the desert . It has no hotel , one caf\u00e9 and one pay phone . The arrival of a band from Egypt is the most exciting thing that has happened there in years . Dina , the caf\u00e9 owner , tells the group that the next bus does not arrive until the next day . Dina offers the band a meal and a place to stay for the night , and Colonel Tewfiq , the band 's leader , reluctantly agrees . In her kitchen , Tewfiq asks her about her background , and she tells how she was once married , and nothing in real life went as she had idealistically and naively thought . She asks Tewfiq the same , and he tells of a wife and son in Egypt . `` What draws me to this show and still keeps me passionate about it is the simplicity of it , '' said Ginsburg . `` There is something about watching real people on stage not acting -- just being . It 's about relationships and humanity -- and human kindness . `` I play Sammy and also play the roller rink guard . I play the people with hot tempers and questionable decisions . Sammy is seeing Dina , but he also is married . The roller rink guard sees Egyptians in town and , automatically , his prejudice shows . `` A lot of what I speak in the show is in Hebrew . My Israeli friends helped me . We have five native Israelis in the cast .

When music fans think of bluegrass music , they think of the South -- especially the mountains . The southern Blue Ridge area has been known through generations and still today as a hotbed of old-time , bluegrass , blues , and country music . When people think of Kalamazoo , Michigan , they think of -- well , who knows what they think of . Maybe they know it 's the home of Western Michigan University . Guitar fans might know it as the home of Gibson Guitars . Not many people would link Kalamazoo with bluegrass music -- unless they are fans of Greensky Bluegrass . Greensky Bluegrass is a five-piece American bluegrass/rock band founded in Kalamazoo in 2000 featuring Anders Beck -LRB- dobro -RRB- , Michael Arlen Bont -LRB- banjo -RRB- , Dave Bruzza -LRB- guitar -RRB- , Mike Devol -LRB- upright bass -RRB- , and Paul Hoffman -LRB- mandolin -RRB- . `` We got our start in Kalamazoo , '' said Hoffman , during a recent phone interview from his home in Denver , Colorado . `` I met two of the guys -- Michael and Dave -- at open mics . We started playing together informally . Anders and Mike joined a little later and the five of us have been together ever since . '' Greensky Bluegrass has built a reputation for bringing rock ` n ' roll showmanship to high-energy bluegrass . `` When we first started , we were learning bluegrass but still had rock-and-roll roots , '' said Hoffman . `` So , we 've always approached it with a rock mentality . `` We were a single mic band for a long time . It has evolved from bluegrass to a psychedelic rock thing . It was a natural evolution -- learning new tricks step-by-step . `` Our instrumentation is dobro , banjo , mandolin , acoustic guitar and upright bass . Two of us -- myself and Dave -- write the songs and sing lead . Altogether , four of us sing . '' Greensky Bluegrass is known for pushing the limits of traditional bluegrass . According to Beck , `` We 're a rock-and-roll band that plays bluegrass instruments . Bluegrass is such a finite thing . Because you have a banjo and a mandolin , you 're supposed to do it a certain way . But we 've always been ourselves . '' For the past 18 years , the band has played up to 175 shows per year and sold out venues such as Red Rocks Amphitheatre and the Ryman Auditorium , as well as performed at festivals such as Bonnaroo , Austin City Limits , and Outside Lands . Last week , Greensky Bluegrass released a new live album -- `` Courage For The Road : Fall 2019 . '' It features 14 songs , hand-selected from various performances on their Fall 2019 tour and remixed and mastered by the band 's longtime studio engineer Glenn Brown . Now , Greensky Bluegrass has embarked on a tour to support the new album . The tour will make a stop locally on January 18 at The Met -LRB- 858 North Broad Street , Philadelphia , http://themetphilly.com -RRB- . Greensky Bluegrass has released 11 albums to date beginning with `` Less Than Supper '' in 2004 . All their releases have been on their own label -- Big Blue Zoo . `` We always just released our records on our own , '' said Hoffman . `` We released our records on Big Blue Zoo and have used national distribution companies along the way . CD Baby has been a big help . `` We did I all ourselves . Our fanbase is a thing that we 've been feeding and it 's growing every day . It 's interesting what you can do independently . `` Our fanbase has grown by word-of-mouth . Also , the festival world has been good for our kind of music . We 've been touring our asses off for 15 years -- 200 shows a year for a couple years in a row . We certainly went at it and hit the concrete hard . We played the entire country two times a year for eight years in a row . '' The band 's most recent studio album is `` All For Money , '' which was released in January 2019 and debuted in the top 10 of Billboard 's bluegrass chart . `` We recorded ` All For Money ' -- digital and tape -- at Echo Mountain Studio in Nashville , '' said Hoffman . `` We spent two weeks recording the tracks and used a lot of analog gear . We like the way tape sounds . We like some of that vintage character and warmth . `` We do n't pay too much attention to whether it 's bluegrass or rock . We just want to push the boundaries and keep challenging ourselves . '' Video link for Greensky Bluegrass -- https://youtu.be/VRwyBwt3dLk . The show at The Met -LRB- 858 North Broad Street , Philadelphia , http://themetphilly.com -RRB- There will be two interesting and very different shows in Wilmington , Delaware this weekend -- classical music by the Serafin Ensemble and non-mainstream humor by the Popovich Pet Comedy Theater . `` Serafin used to be Serafin String Quartet , '' said Artistic Director/violinist Kate Ransom , during a recent phone interview . `` That started in spring 2001 . It became Serafin Ensemble last season . We had been functioning as a quarter for a long time . This is the beginning of our first full season as Serafin Ensemble . `` We had a lot of changes happening in the viola seat . And , our residency as University of Delaware 's String Quartet was coming to an end . So , we decided to move away from the fixed line-up of a string quartet and move to a roster of artists . We wanted more work with other instrumentalists , so we changed to an ensemble . We have a roster of 11 with strings , piano , horn , flute and voice . '' Serafin Ensemble is presenting a musically diverse program on Sunday afternoon . The program will feature three pieces -- Michael Haydn 's `` Duo for violin and viola , '' Caesar Franck 's `` Piano Quintet , '' and Joseph Haydn 's `` Piano Trio in C Major Hob XV :27 . '' `` Hob XV :27 in C major '' is the first of a set of three trios dedicated to Therese Jansen , and published in London in 1797 , after Haydn had returned to Vienna . Jansen was another pianist whom Haydn had met during his two visits to London . In 1795 , at the age of 25 , she married Gaetano Bartolozzi and Haydn was a witness at their wedding . Haydn also dedicated to her two of his most important solo piano sonatas , in E flat and C major . This trio , with its virtuoso piano-writing , suggests that she was a very fine performer . Franck 's `` Piano Quintet in F minor '' is a quintet for piano , two violins , viola , and cello . The work was composed in 1879 and has been described as one of Franck 's chief achievements alongside his other late works such as Symphony in D minor , the Symphonic Variations , the String Quartet , and the Violin Sonata . The work , which has been described as having a `` torrid emotional power , '' features three movements -- Molto moderato quasi lento -- Allegro ; Lento con molto sentimento ; and Allegro non troppo ma con fuoco . On Sunday , the Serafin Ensemble lineup will feature Kate Ransom and Amos Fayette , violins ; Luke Fleming , viola ; Jacques-Pierre Malan , cello ; and Victor Asuncion , piano . Ransom is the artistic director of Serafin Ensemble and a distinguished chamber musician , recitalist and teacher who has presented hundreds of concerts in major chamber music concert halls in North America and Europe . Ms. Ransom pursued post-graduate chamber music study at The Juilliard School with Robert Mann and holds master 's and bachelor 's degrees in violin performance from Yale University and the University of Michigan , respectively . She currently serves as president of The Music School of Delaware and plays a violin made in 1728 by the Venetian master , Sanctus Serafin . Fayette started playing the violin at age two and made his professional debut at the age of eight . He enjoys a diverse career as a performer , educator , and administrator . He holds a bachelor 's degree from the Peabody Conservatory of the John Hopkins University and a master 's degree from the Julliard School of Music .

The concert at Trinity will start at 4 p.m. Admission is free with donations appreciated . The Popovich Comedy Pet Theater is a family-oriented blend of the unique blend of comedy and juggling skills of former Moscow Circus veteran Gregory Popovich and the extraordinary talents of his performing pets . His entourage consists of world-class jugglers , Diamond the Shetland Pony and a variety of performing pets including house cats and dogs , geese , white doves and parrots . There are more than 30 pets in the show . Each one of the dogs and cats has been rescued from animal shelters and given a new `` leash on life ! '' These rescued animals love to perform their skills and stunts on stage . According to Popovich , `` One of the main messages of my show is to bring attention for animal shelters , and the many homeless pets and rescue efforts out there . Because all my pets in my shows have been rescued by animal shelters , I feel it 's my mission to ` payback ' animal shelters and try to help other pets if I have this opportunity . '' Popovich 's unique philosophy toward animal training is to build tricks around the animals ' personalities , instead of pushing them to perform . His technique centers on positive reinforcement and compassion . Comedy Pet Theater is a new way to incorporate pets in showbiz while spotlighting the personality and individualism of each pet . The animal antics are adorable and amazing with dogs and cats jumping rope , riding scooters , jumping over hurdles , balancing on perilously thin beams and moving wheels , and even pushing a stroller ... with a dog in the baby basket . Popovich is a fifth-generation circus performer whose parents were stars of the Russian circus . It was in the Big Top where Popovich honed his natural ability by forming special bonds with the animals in his parents ' act . He learned to juggle at a very early age and went on starring in his first solo performance when he was barely a teenager . For the next few years , Popovich traveled the world with the Moscow Circus , eventually becoming the star of the circus and its representative at international circus competitions worldwide . He performed his juggling act in the center ring and became the first Russian artist to ever appear in the `` Greatest Show on Earth . '' Popovich , whose resume includes being voted `` Entertainer of the Year '' in Las Vegas , has shared his expertise for raising , training and living harmoniously with pets in two books -- `` You CAN Train Your Cat '' and `` Doggy Gone Good '' . He has also produced and starred in a feature film now available for purchase . `` Popovich and the Voice of the Fabled American West '' has already won several awards including `` Audience Choice Award '' at the Dances With Films Festival in Los Angeles , and International Film Festival in Austin , Texas . The Popovich Comedy Pet Theater has a rich performance history , presenting thousands of shows in more than 20 countries and is currently in its 12th season at the Planet Hollywood Resort/Casino in Las Vegas .

That 's the first instruction from Mike Petersen , a retired soil scientist and agronomist . Petersen was a presenter at Wednesday 's South Platte River Salinity Workshop presented by the Centennial , Morgan and Sedgwick County Conservation Districts . Petersen manages the Orthman Research Farm near Lexington , Neb. , and consults with growers regarding strip-till system technology , fertilizer , crop development , root development , and water management . The agronomist addressed misconceptions about salinity in the South Platte Valley during Wednesday 's program . Chief among those misconceptions is that a good rainfall or snowmelt , along with cover crops and no-till practices will solve the problem . That ai n't so , Petersen said . `` It ai n't ever going to be like the good old days , '' he said . `` Change is mandatory . '' That 's a radical departure from the attitudes expressed in May 2019 when salinity in the South Platte first came to the public 's attention . In an article by Shay Castle of Fresh Water News the message was that it 's too soon to tell whether salinity is a problem in the South Platte . That 's when Colorado Corn announced it was sponsoring a study of the issue . That study was completed in October and is due to be released later this month . According to preliminary information in the report , the lower reaches of the river have become pretty salty . Phil Brink of Colorado Cattleman 's Ag Water Network led off with an overview of the issue , which he said has been followed in the Colorado River basin for several years . Brink said salinity levels below Hoover Dam are about 723 milligrams per liter , or about what is in the South Platte just below Denver . By the time the river gets to Sterling , however , that salinity has skyrocketed to 1,275 mg/l , almost twice as salty as the Denver reaches . While much of the problem stems from treated wastewater discharged by municipalities and industries upstream , agriculture is compounding the problem . The re-use of return flow water from upstream irrigation is concentrating salts from cropland and leaching it into the river , where it 's diverted or pumped onto crops and the cycle starts over . There are things that can be done to mitigate the damage , however . Petersen said no-till cultivation and leaving residue on the soil surface is the first step farmers need to take . Better water management , crop rotations and alternative crops are other methods producers can use to minimize salinity in the soil and , thus , in return flow to the river . `` That 's the good news , but it 's going to cost everyone something , '' Petersen said . `` And there 's just no option . Change is mandatory .

Since blazing across pop culture in early '90s , the Latinx hip-hop legends have been the high priests of smoking pot , speakers brimming with not-so-subtle , complex cannabis anthems such as `` Hits From the Bong , '' `` Insane in the Brain , '' and `` I Want to Get High . '' What listeners might have missed between lyrics rhyming `` grass '' with `` ass '' is plenty of beer in the background . `` If you go back to our first Cypress Hill album and listen to ` Hand on the Pump , ' the chorus is ` Sawed off shotgun , hand on the pump / Left hand on a 40 , puffing on a blunt , ''' says Louis Freese , better known as B-Real , a founding MC of the hip-hip trio . `` That meant drinking a 40-ounce beer while puffing on a blunt . People have been drinking beer and smoking weed together forever . '' In early February , B-Real will remix that kinship with the nationwide release of 420 Strain : Insane OG Mexican-Style Craft Lager , a collaboration with SweetWater Brewing . The seasonal release , available until the end of May , `` smells like you 're drinking a bag of weed , '' B-Real says . That sound you heard is my 17-year-old brain going boom . It 's a buck-wild new world , one I could n't have predicted in my most fully baked high school fantasy . But the last half-decade has brought recreational cannabis to California , Colorado , Illinois , and more , states plunging headlong into the legal waters . Buying dubious dime bags from some dude behind the 7-Eleven 's dumpsters is dated news , replaced by dispensaries as sleek as Apple stores , budtenders serving strains tailored to every mood , dude . B-Real is a prominent figure in this flowering cultural realignment , opening a chain of Dr. Greenthumb cannabis dispensaries stretching from Sacramento to San Francisco and a little city called Los Angeles . -LRB- B-Real nabbed his Dr. Greenthumb nickname from another Cypress Hill song . -RRB- He also hosts Viceland 's cannabis cooking show Bong App\u00e9tit , sponsored by SweetWater . `` Music , beer and weed always go hand in hand , right ? '' says SweetWater cofounder Freddy Bensch . `` We 've been big fans of Cypress Hill going back to the old days . '' The brewery has been wink-wink about weed since its 1997 founding , releasing an extra pale ale called 420 -- slang for getting stoned -- and hosting the annual 420 Fest , a music-and-beer celebration that 's featured Cypress Hill . As pot 's public-opinion polls trended upward , SweetWater put its love of cannabis front and center with its 420 Strain series that debuted in August 2018 . SweetWater mimics specific cannabis varieties ' aromatic signatures by using a calibrated blend of hops , hemp flavors , and terpenes -- organic compounds that give plants such as pine trees and mint their distinct scents . Current members of the series include G13 IPA , which smells dankly resinous , while Mango Kush wheat beer packs a pungently fruity punch and Chocolope takes a chocolaty stout on a tropical ride . The 420 Strain line has been a scorching success , with Chicago-based market research firm IRI naming G13 the top new craft beer brand in 2019 . `` We want to continue to feed it , '' Bensch says . That 's where B-Real comes in . The rapper and cannabis entrepreneur had long admired SweetWater for splashing 420 across its labels . Craft breweries , he says , are much like cannabis cultivators in `` coming up with all these different flavors that people enjoy ... It 's a great opportunity to bring our brands together and show the possibility of taking these flavor profiles and putting them in beer . '' For the collaboration , B-Real selected his flagship Dr. Greenthumb strain , Insane OG , and a Mexican lager that SweetWater goosed to around 5.6 percent ABV , more akin to a medium-bodied Modelo Negra than any clear-bottled , lime-squeezed beach beer . `` It provides a nice platform , '' Bensch says . SweetWater brewed the lager with fruity Crystal and Jolly Rancher -- like El Dorado hops , complemented by terpenes and hemp flavor that ape Insane OG 's grape fragrance . `` The fact that it smells like cannabis is fucking amazing , '' says B-Real , who traveled to Atlanta for the December brew day . He 'll return in February to celebrate the collaboration by performing at SweetWater 's 23rd anniversary bash , equally a party and an opportunity to spread cannabis education . to perform at this year 's 420 Fest . -RRB- `` People that might not necessarily be cannabis users might taste the beer and want to learn about it , '' he says . `` Maybe that drives them to cannabis culture . I think that 's a win . '' SweetWater will continue exploring the intersection of beer and cannabis in its 420 Strain series with releases such asTrainwreck hazy double IPA , which will also debut in February as a new year-round beer . It 's redolent of ripe oranges rolled in vanilla beans and pine needles , showcasing how `` cannabis strains run the gamut of flavor , aroma and occasions , and our beers will hopefully run the gamut too , '' Bensch says . It 's a fertile opportunity for craft breweries to grow their audience by creating crossover hits from the bong . `` Who 's the drinker and what 's the occasion ? I think it 's infinite , '' Bensch says . `` We 're creating a new consumer .

Listen To Episodes 5 and 6 of Boomtown To Find Out", "content": "For the last several months , Marfa Public Radio has been working behind the scenes on a project that many West Texans have caught wind of by now : Texas Monthly ` s Boomtown . The podcast , produced in partnership with Imperative Entertainment , brings listeners into the heart of America 's most productive oilfield -- the Permian Basin . It explores the lives of people directly affected by the boom and bust cycles that have defined the the region for nearly a century , from roughnecks and executives , to barbers , waitresses , and sex workers . Below , listen to two episodes of Boomtown that Marfa Public Radio 's Sally Beauvais helped report and edit -- alongside freelance journalist Susan Elizabeth Shepard and the staff at Texas Monthly -- that explore a different kind of boom in the Permian Basin . Episode 5 : Boobtown From Christian Wallace , Boomtown 's host : For more than a century , every time a new oil and gas boom gets under way , it 's followed by a boom in another industry : sex work . Young men flock to the oil patch during a boom to rake in more money than most of them have ever seen . Many of these guys are single , and those that are married often leave their families behind and send paychecks home . This creates a certain market for those who sell sex . In the 1920s , when West Texas boomtowns were little more than glorified campgrounds , the women who provided these services were called `` camp followers . '' Today , sex work is n't the only way to make a fast buck off of lonely oilfield workers . Feminine charms are also valuable in the service industry . Over the next two episodes , we explore several ways that some women are cashing in on the boom . To tell this story , journalist Susan Elizabeth Shepard takes over hosting duties . Susan worked as a stripper while attending the University of Texas in Austin . After she graduated , she started traveling the country , working at clubs on an unofficial circuit . In 2007 , a friend tipped her off to the oil boom in North Dakota 's Bakken Shale Formation . Over the next six years , she danced at a club in the small boomtown of Williston . While most of the cities and small towns Susan worked in had a lot in common , Williston was different . She chronicled her experiences working there in an essay for BuzzFeed , `` Wildcatting : A Stripper 's Guide to the Modern American Boomtown . '' In the first of two episodes , Susan and her reporting partner , Sally Beauvais of Marfa Public Radio , take us behind the scenes to speak with baristas at a lingerie coffee shop , as well as the manager of a locally owned `` breastaurant '' and a dancer at one of Odessa 's two strip clubs . Episode 6 : A Thin Line From Christian Wallace , Boomtown 's host : In our second of two episodes focusing on sex work in the Permian Basin , guest host Susan Elizabeth Shepard returns to speak with advocates and law enforcement who work directly with both sex trafficking victims and those who sell sex consensually . She is joined again by reporter Sally Beauvais of Marfa Public Radio . As Susan explains in this episode , there are many misconceptions about sex work , and about trafficking -- and strongly differing opinions about everything from the legal rights of those who sell sex consensually to who is actually a victim and who is not . Susan takes us to an office in downtown Midland to meet Lisa Bownds , who is in the process of opening The Village , a shelter for female victims of sex trafficking . The 25-acre property outside of Midland is a dream of Lisa 's that 's been years in the planning . In 2016 , Lisa formed Reflection Ministries , a faith-based trafficking outreach program , in part because of her own experience as a trafficking victim . Bownds tells Susan that The Village will provide housing for twenty trafficking victims when it opens in February -- and hopes that in the next few years it will expand to house up to one hundred victims . While there is no hard evidence to support claims of major spikes in trafficking in the area , Lieutenant John Sikes of the Odessa Police Department tells Susan the boom has led to a definite uptick in sex work . As the manager of the OPD 's Intelligence Division , John oversees the vice unit -- and as a lifelong Odessan , he 's accustomed to the ebb and flow of crime that comes with booms and busts . Thefts and burglaries rise during hard times and the number of prostitution charges climbs with every boom . It makes sense , he says : `` This is where the money is . '' While John says he 'd rather go after `` the sharks '' and put traffickers behind bars than make one hundred prostitution cases , those cases still get made . Researcher and activist Terra Burns tells Susan that she thinks the best way to fight trafficking is to decriminalize the selling and buying of sex . An Alaska native , Terra has experienced oil booms firsthand as a sex worker . The experiences she shares with Susan epitomize the complicated realities of sex work . She says that some of the same polices enacted to protect the women involved can ultimately end up harming them . While Lisa and Terra both want to protect trafficking victims , their positions are at the root of two different approaches to fighting trafficking and highlight the complexity of the ongoing debate over sex work .", "url": "https://marfapublicradio.org/blog/whats-it-like-selling-sex-appeal-in-the-permian-basin-listen-to-episodes-5-and-6-of-boomtown-to-find-out/", "kws": ["Permian^^Basin", "Boomtown", "Episodes", "boom", "Williston", "oil^^and^^gas", "Sex^^Appeal", "oil^^booms", "sex^^work", "Odessa", "West^^Texas^^boomtowns", "podcast", "Marfa^^Public^^Radio", "sex^^trafficking", "Selling", "listeners", "North^^Dakota", "lonely^^oilfield^^workers", "downtown^^Midland", "Alaska"], "text_category": {}}

Year on year , the shifts in the K-pop scene may not be apparent , but looking back on a block of ten years , so much has changed . The way fans consume music shifted from CDs and illegally downloading zips -- in 2010 , the iTunes store was nowhere as well-stocked with K-pop as Apple Music is today , nor was Spotify available internationally -- to streaming . K-pop also cycled through a ton of genres : from electro-pop , dance pop , and dance ballads , to hip-hop and trap , and to future bass and tropical house . The music and styling went from emo and dramatic to mellow and moody , while breaking news went in the opposite direction , becoming darker , more complex , and more shocking than before . The Seoulbeats Decade in Review series delves deeper into some of these changes , balancing a critical lens with the writers ' perspectives as fans . We first dipped our toes into a decade retrospective with a look at the Korean hip-hop scene . For the second Decade in Review feature , because combing through hundreds of releases for a top five list for our End-of-Year Reviews is n't quite challenging enough , the Seoulbeats editors found a new form of self-torment : picking one song per year from 2010 -- 2019 to talk about . Our team of six -- many of whom have been K-pop fans since the mid - and late-2000s -- put our K-pop grandma heads together to look at the releases that stood out each year and defined the landscape , shaping it towards the scene we see today . Editor 's Note : This is the second part of the review ; for song picks from 2010-2014 , please check out part one here : seoulbeats.com/2020/01/sb-decade-in-review-a-song-a-year-2010-2014/ 2015 Editors ' Picks : BTS -- `` I Need U '' , `` Run '' / Day6 -- `` Congratulations '' / Shinee -- `` View '' Karen : 2015 can be hailed as a great year that saw BTS ' HYYH being released , an album that would propel the group to great fame . But hold your horses , because the year also saw many important debuts of groups like Twice , Seventeen , GFriend , and my personal favourite , Day6 . The band 's debut song `` Congratulations '' is still unforgettable , no matter how many albums they 've released . Even as they continue to experiment with various music genres , `` Congratulations '' encapsulates the spirit of Day6 and is almost a trademark song of theirs . It 's fascinating to see how something like a debut song can already articulate the band 's music style so well . Chelsea : I loved Day6 's The Day album , though `` Congratulations '' was probably one of my least favorite tracks on it . If B-sides counted , I would vote for Day6 's `` Blood '' because it was my song of spring . Realistically though , I completely agree that HYYH was one of the most significant developments of 2015 . So much so , that when choosing a song of the year for 2015 , it 's hard to choose which BTS song wins . Aastha : Oh , for sure . If you look across the HYYH albums , there are multiple noteworthy tracks . But just between the titles , `` I Need U '' and `` Run '' , the latter is my pick . Despite the uptempo beats of the song , it manages to evoke feelings of nostalgia and wistfulness . And what an impact it made on BTS ' videography and discography . While `` I Need U '' could stand alone as a title , `` Run '' was the starting point of a narrative that set BTS ' creative path for the next few years . Both `` I Need U '' and `` Run '' were such turning points in their sound , and perhaps without these electro-pop titles we would have never gotten `` Blood Sweat & Tears '' . It says something about audience reception when expanding their sound from hip-hop in preceding albums to pop in HYYH shot them to fame . Qing : As Karen noted , this was another year of great debuts : Seventeen brought their youthful brand of funk pop and hip-hop in `` Adore U '' , and GFriend 's `` Glass Bead '' delivered a shot of nostalgia for those familiar with SNSD 's debut , `` Into the New World '' . Yet my choice is unequivocally BTS ' `` I Need U '' . From the opening harmonisations and synths that pelt down like droplets of water from a leaking faucet , it evoked a sense of space like I had never heard any other K-pop song do before . The soundscape the production created was empty , desolate , young , vulnerable ; it changed what I noticed about and came to expect from song production . Listening to it did n't just feel like being absorbed into a story the way `` Error '' did ; I was transported into something even more personal : the diary entries , the inner world , of someone too young to be this disillusioned . Janine : Choosing my favourite BTS song from this era is too difficult , so I refuse to do it . HYYH is my favourite era and I 'm not ashamed to admit it . Album tracks like `` Autumn Leaves '' , `` Hold Me Tight '' , and `` Outro : House of Cards '' had me playing BTS when I was in a late night funk , while the uptempo hits were still there to remind me why I was a fan in the first place . Because the BTS question is too difficult to answer , I will pick a song I slip on in the summer every year since it was released : `` View '' by Shinee . Odd was an album that did n't only show consistency from a very solid , musical group -- it remarkably showed there was even more to expect from Shinee . Chill tropical EDM with melodies and harmonies as sweet as summer soft-serve , `` View '' is the song you did n't know you needed at your pool party . For sheer longevity , it gets my vote . 2016 Editors ' Picks : Seventeen -- `` Very Nice '' / Twice -- `` TT '' Karen : It 's not fair that we have to only pick one song for 2016 , and it gave me a huge headache , because this year was truly too great to be true . Lee Hi 's `` Breathe '' and Got7 's `` Hard Carry '' came along with the debuts of Black Pink , NCT 127 , NCT Dream and much more . The groups that have risen to popularity in recent years mostly debuted in 2015 or 2016 , and the songs released during this period of time represent their early days of hardwork as they build their own identity . However , my true troubles came with choosing between Seventeen 's `` Boom Boom '' and `` Very Nice '' , I went with `` Very Nice '' because of how it encapsulates Seventeen 's image of youthfulness and spontaneity , a concept that they carry into future releases . Seventeen might have many more amazing performances to come , but `` Very Nice '' remains a great hit even now for its bursts of energy , conveyed musically in the chorus that explodes with each line of `` very nice '' . `` Very Nice '' can probably be termed as the group 's trademark song , one that has found its way from the K-pop sphere to greater exposure . It is still often heard on variety shows or sports events in Korea , with the catchy phrase `` very nice '' ringing in good cheer . Qing : 2016 was the year that K-pop started bailing out of proper choruses , replacing them with instrumental breakdowns and a chanted catchphrase . But `` Very Nice '' reminded me so much of early K-pop 's straightforward charm that I forgave its lack of a melody in the chorus . Much as I love my dramatic dance ballads , and the tangle of angst they offer up , there 's something undeniably appealing about a simple song that 's so pure and emotionally accessible in its joy and excitement . But it also switches up the rhythm and vocal arrangements just enough to keep the listener on the edge of the seat , much like how the persona of the song must be feeling . Janine : 2015 and 2016 are tortuous to choose a favourite ! There were so many giant hits that have made a huge impact personally and to the landscape of K-pop . We began to witness the decline of choruses , but my favourite from the year has a fairly standard three-chorus structure . In fact , I would call it a pretty generic composition , but no song can touch Twice 's triumphant `` TT '' on sheer earworm appeal . Is it a little cringey ? Absolutely . Does it matter ? Absolutely not . `` TT '' - sus -LRB- as it is affectionately known in my house -RRB- has joined `` All I Want For Christmas Is You '' on my Christmas playlist and `` Monster Mash '' on my Halloween playlist because it is both deranged and euphoric . The more you listen to the artificial hand claps , ascending and descending whoos in the background , and the weird jukebox noises , the more you are drawn into the demented funhouse of Twice 's universe . 2017 Editors ' Picks : Seventeen -- `` Clap '' , `` Do n't Wan na Cry '' / Taemin -- `` Move '' Qing : 2016 was a great year musically , but in 2017 I developed a love-hate relationship with K-pop . Following the new waves K-pop -- particularly BTS -- was making in the American market , Western EDM trends dug their claws in deep . While this phenomenon injected fresh sounds into the increasingly saturated landscape , it also robbed K-pop of so much that makes it special . No track embodies my ambivalence better than Seventeen 's `` Do n't Wan na Cry '' . It features a sleek , minimalistic soundscape that we do n't hear in the earlier part of the decade ; it points to the production possibilities that attention towards Western EDM trends opened up . The buildup of bubbling synths , drums , and plaintive vocals is cinematic . It 's so damn near perfect , but the oh-so-trendy , hopelessly generic future bass synths and the lack of a melody in the chorus keeps it from being so . Karen : I 'm going to first thank Qing for picking `` Do n't Wan na Cry '' , just so I can be free from any dilemma and pick Seventeen 's `` Clap '' . The song hooked me in from the start , with the guitar riffs and progression into a mixture of funk and rock . It screams charisma , but what 's even more impressive is how it manages to suppress the potentially overpowering electric guitars by using it sparingly . I love how the music goes bare right before the bridge , and the choreography snaps into place with the bass beats . `` Clap '' brilliantly uses the diversity in vocal and rap deliveries to propel the song forward , with the instrumental backdrop only as a complement , spotlighting the group 's strength in numbers as they echo the chorus . As with many of their songs , the energy of `` Clap '' makes it perfect for live performances , showcasing the wholesomeness of Seventeen 's talents in marrying skillful vocals with stunning stage presence . Janine : 2017 was a turning point in my own K-pop journey , because I found myself seeking out deep cuts from groups I had n't listened to before and crucially , I began listening to solo projects . I 've always been a group fan but this year is when I started to give my attention to musicians like Sunmi , Ha : tfelt , Chungha , and IU -LRB- yes , I know I am a monster -RRB- . The rise of EDM and future bass was widespread enough to force me to widen my scope of attention , and I ended up finding some of my favourite artists today . Taemin captivated the world with `` Move '' . The performance elements are rightfully remarked upon but for me , the album is just as important . Taemin put moody dance synth pop like `` Move '' and `` Thirsty '' next to big R&B ballads like `` Love '' and crying in the club joints like `` Stone Heart '' . Move gave me life and reminded me good music exists every year , you just have to listen for it . 2018 Editors ' Picks : N.Flying -- `` Hot Potato '' / Red Velvet -- `` Peek-a-Boo '' / Shinee -- `` Countless '' / The Rose -- `` She 's in the Rain '' Aastha : I had the hardest time choosing between The Rose 's `` B.A.B.Y '' and Red Velvet 's `` Peek-a-Boo '' , but I 'd have to say that `` Peek-a-Boo '' reigns . With `` Peek-a-Boo '' and Perfect Velvet , SM showed how a well-curated concepts and calculated planning can do wonders and justice to girl groups . Previously , Red Velvet had been known for their `` red '' concepts , with `` Ice Cream Cake '' and `` Dumb Dumb '' . SM gave Red Velvet so much depth and dimensionality by fleshing out not just the cute and bubbly `` red '' side but also the mature and classy `` velvet '' side . It also helps that `` Peek-a-Boo '' by itself is a notably catchy song ; the combination of staccato percussion beats , a smooth synthline and an addictive hook had little room for failure . Qing : Gosh , what happened to 2018 K-pop ? There were solid releases , but I struggled to find a stand-out . The trends that I hated -- the lack of proper choruses -- continued dominating songs . Maybe that 's what sent me running into the arms of N.Flying 's `` Hot Potato '' -LRB- and I know I 'm going out on a limb here -RRB- . It 's silly but confident , packed to the brim with soaring melodies and the fun and energy that 's missing from so many title tracks released in 2018 . Having choruses you could sing along to used to be such an essential ingredient in any K-pop title track , it 's hard to imagine we 've arrived at a point where songs like `` Hot Potato '' have become a rarity . Karen : Aastha , I 'll save you from your hesitations by pushing The Rose 's `` She 's in the Rain '' into the list . The band certainly deserves more attention for their musical talent . The Rose vibes with a sound similar to British pop rock at times , which might not always appeal to a Korean audience . As opposed to their debut track `` Sorry '' , `` She 's in the Rain '' was the song that I kept returning to for its lyrics and magical ability to conjure an atmosphere of melancholy . It 's not an especially complex song , but the slow progression from the acoustic guitar strumming into a more layered chorus pushes the song to its emotional climax . I was especially hooked on the phrase , `` It 's better to be held than holding on , '' which Woosung delivers like a stab right in the feels . Janine : 2018 was a very emotional year in music as Jonghyun 's final album Poet | Artist was released ; this was followed by the Story of Light series by Shinee which explored the process of grieving in the public eye . It was very difficult for me to think of anything that affected me as much as the three-EP project . The Story of Light was incredibly heartbreaking if you knew the backstory and enchanting even if you did n't . Shinee cemented their place as one of my all-time favourite groups by remaining to create consistently excellent electronic music like `` Countless '' , even when processing the most tragic circumstances . My affair with soloists began to seriously threaten my loyalty to groups this year too . Join us , Qing -- we have Eric Nam ! And choruses ! 2019 Editors ' Picks : Dreamcatcher -- `` And There Was No One Left '' / Ha Sungwoon ft. Park Jihoon -- `` Do n't Forget '' / Stray Kids -- `` Miroh '' Pat : I have nothing to say except give me back my choruses , you cowards . Karen : Well , it has been a pretty bland year -- which makes it perfect to spotlight the underdogs and rising stars . I caught Ha Sungwoon performing at KAMP Singapore , and I became a fan . `` Do n't Forget '' was the song that stood out to me , and only after the concert did I realise he sang it with fellow Wan na One member , Park Jihoon . It balances melodic rhythm with whimsical lyrics . Having two male vocals made for good synergy , making it more dynamic as opposed to his other songs . Honestly , this song made me realise that I had no idea where these Wan na One members went , though they have so much talent , and made me wonder why they are n't being spotlighted more . Qing : And to think I complained about 2018 ! I ca n't decide if I want to give 2019 K-pop a consolatory hug for being so splendidly unspectacular , or grab it by the neck and throttle it for letting this much talent in producing and performing go to waste . But like Karen , I found my ears perking up at what the young ones have to offer . It 's fitting that at this juncture that feels so stagnant with unexciting trends , my pick goes to a group that reminds me so much of B.A.P and their rookie rebellion against dominant styles . K-pop has flirted with trance before -LRB- most notably A.C.E with `` Callin ''' and `` Cactus '' , and Monsta X with `` Be Quiet '' and some b-sides -RRB- . But Stray Kids -LRB- also a revelation from KAMP Singapore -RRB- took psychedelic trance 's hand firmly and brought it on a date . Not only was the date that is `` Miroh '' a smashing success , it also made me see the prospect of this becoming a serious relationship for the genre and K-pop at large . As the marimba-like synths plink on , the vocals keep soaring higher and higher , culminating in , yes , an instrumental breakdown punctuated by roars and eagle shrieks tying in with the jungle metaphor of the lyrics . But this is quickly followed by an actual melody , and as a result , the energy level never flags or plateaus , the way it does in so many recent songs . Writing this post , I 've been reflecting on just what about recent K-pop 's lack of proper choruses bothers me . It goes beyond personal music preference . It 's that the best K-pop songs have always felt like a complete experience that commands the listener 's full attention . They 're not throwaway tracks that work as ambient background music for a store . Taking amazing buildups and proper choruses away felt like K-pop lost what made it most powerful . So moving into the 2020s , I have just one wish as a fan : I want my kick-ass choruses back . Janine : Y\u2019 all , I 'm about to beat my well-worn drum : good music exists in every year , we just have to find it . 2019 brought us some really strong girl group efforts like No. 1 from CLC , XX from Loona , White Wind from Mamamoo , and my personal favourite The End of Nightmare from Dreamcatcher . Weak or non-existent choruses aside , I am getting the theatricality , concepts , and ambitious production style choices I need from Dreamcatcher . The babymetal concept has been expanded to include other influences and the group is better for it . `` And There Was No One Left '' is a departure from the rock influences of the rest of their discography , with the chorus being replaced by a catchy instrumental hook . Everything we hate ! But the bassline is incredible and the members deliver sultry vocals to let you know , no genre is outside of their abilities . I can only urge K-pop listeners to push past the overwhelming fatigue you will inevitably feel when first listening to the most popular songs and allow artists to surprise you . I had stopped keeping up with Got7 for about two years before I heard the tight , incredibly sexy EP released by Yugeom and JB 's subunit Jus2 . The EP prompted me to listen to `` You Calling My Name '' and suddenly , I 'm reinvested in Got7 's journey . To everyone who is languishing without decent hooks -- it takes about three years for the circle to come around . 2020 could be the turn .

News Meet The First-Time GRAMMY Nominee : Jessie Reyez 's Best Urban Contemporary Album Nomination Is For Her Parents Ahead of the 62nd GRAMMY Awards , Jessie Reyez opens up about her Best Urban Contemporary Album nomination for her second EP , ` Being Human In Public ' GRAMMYs Jan 14 , 2020 - 5:46 pm Being Human In Public , Jessie Reyez says , is about `` being untouchable from other people 's opinions . '' The seven-track EP released in 2018 is a continuation of what she began on 2017 's Kiddo : tough , yet vulnerable songwriting featuring strong vocals over R&B beats . `` You ai n't scared to f**k , but you scared of being lovers / Why is that , huh ? '' she calls out in `` F**k Being Friends . '' But the tough-talking Reyez is n't afraid to let her guard down either . We see a softer side to her on `` Apple Juice . '' `` You should know that I 'm at your mercy / I 've spent my life searching for you , '' she sings , demonstrating how even the most walled-off hearts are susceptible to love 's power . Reyez 's way of navigating matters of the heart as a 20-something has earned her more than 13 million streams a month on Spotify . Her talent has led her to become the `` voice to watch out for , '' and her second EP , Being Human In Public , has nabbed her a 2020 GRAMMY nomination for Best Urban Contemporary Album . Jessie Reyez | Meet The First-Time GRAMMY Nominee Chatting with the Recording Academy ahead of the 62nd GRAMMY Awards , Reyez said that being nominated for an EP feels `` unreal . '' -LRB- She joins the likes of H.E.R. in being nominated without having released an official full-length album yet . -RRB- Since gaining traction online in the mid-2010s , Reyez has collaborated with the likes of Calvin Harris , Tory Lanez , Eminem , Normani , 6lack and Sam Smith on the singing and songwriting front -LRB- she co-wrote Harris ' pop hit `` One Kiss '' featuring Dua Lipa -RRB- . But as much as she enjoys writing for others , her focus is on her own artistry , and that includes nurturing her Latina roots . Born to Colombian parents in Toronto , Canada , Reyez became interested in music thanks to her family . She would sing with her dad in church , her brother played the clarinet and a lot of records were heard around her house . Her father would play cumbia records all the time when she was growing up . In other interviews , she 's mentioned the impact Colombian artists like Carlos Vives -LRB- who brought Vallenato , a kind of folk music in Colombia to other parts of Latin Americain and beyond -RRB- have had on her . She features her first song in Spanish on her GRAMMY-nominated album . Co-written with GRAMMY-winning Argentine singer/songwriter Claudia Brant , `` Sola '' touches on the expectations placed on women in relationships . When asked about what featuring a Spanish-language song on her album means to her , Reyez has a simple answer : `` It means I 'm being myself . Being me is being Canadian , being Colombian . '' Before releasing a Spanish-language song , Reyez incorporated Spanglish in her music effortlessly : `` F**k it , remember back when I told ya / That I 'm a loca Colombiana -LRB- Yo te lo dije -RRB- , '' she sings on `` F**k it . '' Outside her album , Reyez has teamed up with big names in Latin music too . Among them are Latin GRAMMY winner Karol G , GRAMMY-nominated heavy-hitter urbano producer Tainy and GRAMMY-nominated bachata/pop singer Romeo Santos . Amidst the success Latin urban is seeing , Reyez is n't jumping on a trend ; she is simply being herself : a leading young Latinx artist showing the mainstream that you ca n't make an artist choose between one of their identities . She 's also an artist who understands that there 's power in a platform . In her song about long-distance love , Reyez touches on the undocumented immigrant experience . `` You 're still a world away / And you 're still waitin ' for your papers / Been feelin ' like the government wants us to break up , '' she croons . `` I feel what you feel when you 're far away / It 's been a hundred days / Since I kissed your face . '' '' The song 's video features images of President Trump along with scenes of ICE separating family members . Reyez is proud to come from immigrant parents and always felt welcome growing up in Canada . `` Canada has this really cool way -- specifically Toronto -- of encouraging you to wave both flags , if you 've been born there , like wave your flag and then wave your parent 's flag too and be proud of it , '' she told the Recording Academy in 2018 . Today , Reyez says her nomination is as much for her as it is for her parents . `` They have so much to do with who I am . They 're responsible for how I was raised , '' she says . `` It 's because of them that I am who I am , so of course this is for them . '' And that 's exactly who was there when she found out she was nominated for a GRAMMY . In a video posted to Instagram , Reyez opens the door seemingly just haven woken up and gets greeted by her parents with a huge hug and the news of her nomination . `` They 're my best friend . They 're the people who look out for me the most , '' she says . Her nephews also act as a stabilizing force , never letting her head get too big . `` Oh Tia , are you saying that you can sing now ? '' one of them joked after she explained how they could pursue a career in graphic design if they wished -LRB- after all , she 's making a living from her dreams -RRB- . `` That 's how they keep me grounded , '' she said laughing about the moment . Although a light-hearted exchange , Reyez takes it as a reminder that she is always working on becoming better . In her words , she 's `` hella meticulous '' about her craft . Being Human In Public is one manifestation of her drive . But one thing 's clear , she wants to reach the top by being herself . That 's a major theme behind her album and the reason behind her album title . Being real is something that can be hard to achieve in the age of Instagram when everything and everyone seems so polished . `` I do n't want to dress up . I do n't want to put on makeup . I do n't want to be fake nice to anybody , I just want to be myself , '' she says . At the moment , she feels in control of her narrative on social media but says that that could change as her career grows . Whatever happens , `` Nobody 's gon na say -LSB- she -RSB- did n't give it all , '' as she declares in `` Saint Nobody .

0.0	{"docid": "0Ns0s3q3", "title": "What Are the Best Workout Leggings for Women ?", "content": "The days of one pair of leggings for every workout are long gone . We are in an era of kit made specifically for niche classes -- from soft , high-waist leggings for hot yoga and barre to sweat-wicking and compression fabrics for interval training and CrossFit . Deciding which leggings are the right match for you and your workout can be confusing , so we asked 11 top fitness experts , including a barre teacher , a yoga instructor , a running coach , and a body builder , for their go-to leggings for every session . Best Overall Gym Leggings Lululemon Align Pant Full Length 28 '' Lululemon was praised repeatedly by our panel , but it was its Align Pant that four of our experts could n't get enough of . ` They are the softest pair of leggings I own -- they feel like a second skin ' , says Tally Rye , personal trainer and author of Train Happy , who wears them to work with her clients and for her own gym workouts . For Maria Eleftheriou , head of barre at Psycle London , Align 's allure is in the way they ` hold their shape and quality during movements ' . Digme Fitness founder Caoimhe Bamber likes the way the ` thick , high waistband helps you feel tucked in ' , while Courtney Murray , a barre teacher at triyoga , singles out these as one of the few black leggings that ` remain completely opaque , despite constant washing ' . They 're available in sizes UK 4-18 , with three lengths and 29 colours , They also have a handy pocket inside the waistband , big enough for your locker key . Keep an eye out for the brand 's We Made Too Much sales , which often feature heavily discounted Align Pants in bold shades -LRB- think mustard yellow and rose pink -RRB- . Best for running Nike Racer Women 's Warm Running Leggings Three of our fitness experts recommended Nike 's range of leggings for multiple disciplines , but for winter running , Rowen Aida , instructor at SoulCycle and short-distance road runner , returns again and again to Nike 's mid-waist Racer style . Now on her third pair , she rates their soft and stretchy yet supportive material -- a thick , suede-like polyester and elastane mix -- which offers warmth and protection against the elements . ` Also , they have a zipped pocket on the back , which I use to store my phone and keys ' . Racer come in sizes UK 4 -- 22 , and three colours -- turquoise , cedar , and black -- but Aida always chooses the latter because `` it does n't show up any awkward sweat spots '' -- thanks , largely , to the Dri-Fit material , which moves sweat away from the body and to the surface of the fabric , allowing it to evaporate quicker . Best for spin P.E. Nation Straight Fire leggings Australian label PE Nation describes itself as ` active streetwear ' and counts Kylie Jenner , Joan Smalls , and Margot Robbie as fans . Its bright-orange high-rise Straight Fire are the only leggings Eleftheriou wears during spin classes . `` They are incredibly flattering and they take a lot of wear -- even after the intense sessions I do , '' she says . Fi Clark , a fellow spin fan and yoga teacher at FLY LDN , agrees . `` In spin there 's so much movement of the hips and knee flexing , and these withstand those highly repetitive movements in a hot and sweaty environment , '' she says . Available in sizes XS -- L -LRB- though they come up small , so go a size up -RRB- , Clark likes the front-zip fastening and the material , which is ` light and breathable , and dries quickly ' . Best for high-intensity workouts Lululemon Fast and Free HR Tight 25 '' Three on our panel praised the Lululemon Fast and Free HR Tight for offering comfort and flexibility during fast-paced HIIT classes , dynamic stretches , intervals , and circuit training . ` They 're silky on my skin , as well as shapely and supportive ' , says Bamber , who has several pairs in different colours -LRB- there are seven in total , in sizes UK 4 -- 18 , and three lengths -RRB- . Rye likes the ` useful pockets on the back of the waistband and outside thigh , and thick , comfortable high waist ' , and thinks ` they are great cost-per-wear : I have worn them two or three times a week for the past three years , and they are only just wearing out . '' They dry quickly after the ` sweatiest classes ' , according to Eleftheriou . Best for CrossFit Women 's UA RUSH Leggings # 40 -LRB- was # 60 , now 33 % off -RRB- CrossFit 's challenging strength and conditioning exercises require sturdy kit that does n't need constant readjustment . Nicki Petitt , former GB trampolinist and F45 coach , says the only leggings that meet that requirement are Under Armour RUSH Leggings . ` The fabric is designed to absorb the energy and heat created while training and return it back into your muscles , meaning improved strength and endurance ' , she says . ` I was a little skeptical of the claims , but wow ! I train hard in them and recover fast ' . Petitt points out Under Armour 's broad range of RUSH leggings , which include 12 styles , several colours and prints , three lengths , and all available in sizes XS -- XL . Petitt , who is five-foot-five , wears the XS , and finds they stay in place when she runs and bends , and ` they 're shapely on the bum , tight on the quads , and there 's no bagginess behind the knees ' . Best for dance Sweaty Betty Power Mesh 7/8 Gym Leggings ` When I dance , I need to feel powerful , and Power Mesh 7/8 Gym Leggings help me do just that ' , says Bonnie Lister Parsons , founder of Seen on Screen . ` They hold my body really well , and have the right balance of quality and look , with mesh panels on the inside and calf that make them stand out from other standard black styles ' . Available in XXS -LRB- a UK6 -RRB- to XL -LRB- a UK16 -RRB- , with a rear waistband pocket big enough for an iPhone 7 , Lister Parsons rates their soft , body-hugging fit , which means they do n't budge during her fast-paced classes . The leggings , which are made from compression material , also come in a cropped style , which sit just below the knee , plus there 's a matching crop top in the same range . Best for yoga Lululemon Wunder Under HR Tight Lululemon comes up again with its Wunder Under HR Tight , recommended by three of our panel . Clark teaches yoga six days a week and says they ` are the only leggings I feel comfortable in ' . Clark practises a lot of yin yoga , which involves seated and lying-down postures , and finds ` these give me enough room to move around the mat ' . Wunder Under come in three colours , but Clark is drawn towards black , which ` look amazing with everything from a brightly patterned sports bra to boots and a nice top if I 'm dashing out from teaching an evening class ' . They also wash well -- Clark has had some pairs for over three years , and she still get comments about how well they fit . Eastnine coach Tashi Skervin-Clarke calls them ` squatproof ' , while Eleftheriou says the Wunder Under in 28-inch length has finally given her a pair of leggings that flatter her five-foot-nine height and ` hold their shape during movements ' . Best for hot yoga Zero Gravity High Waisted 7/8 Running Leggings Sweaty Betty Zero Gravity Leggings are actually designed for running , but Charlie Morgan , Hotpod 's head of yoga , champions them for hot yoga classes . Available in two lengths -- \u215e and cropped -- Morgan finds ` the fabric sculpts your body and allows for easy movement , but it 's also light-weight and sweat wicking ' . They are made from compression fabric , which helps reduce fatigue and promotes muscle recovery , but during practise ` you feel as if you 're not wearing anything ' . Eastnine 's Skervin-Clarke echoes this ` glove-like fit ' and also points to the fashion-y prints -- although you 'll have to join the waiting list if you want the olive animal print . Best for plus-size Sturdy by Design Midnight Sports Leggings Julie Creffield , five-time marathon runner and founder of the website Too Fat to Run , spent years trying out different leggings during her training runs and racing before discovering Sturdy by Design . Founded by Wiltshire-based bodybuilder Charlene Harvey , the brand is designed for curvy and muscular body shapes , with an emphasis on durability and bold patterns . Creffield has worn the brand for the last two years . `` I used to get terrible chafing on my thighs no matter what preventions I took , '' she says . `` These leggings have lots of stretch , and you can do the squat test in them and not reveal your underwear . '' Highlights include the ` massive ' comfortable waistband and drawstring -- a combination Creffield 's struggled to find in other brands -- and the ` incredible ' graphic prints , which stand up to repeated wear and washing cycles .

House Bill 2044 proposes to mandate parental review boards at every public library to determine what is and is n't `` age-appropriate '' and would pull funding from any library in the state that does n't comply the new draconian measures . No public library shall receive any state aid under this section if such library allows minors to access age-inappropriate sexual materials in violation of section 182.821 . The Bill At first , it appears like boilerplate obscenity laws , until the differences start to sink in -LRB- all emphasis is mine -RRB- . 2 . As used in this section , the following terms mean : -LRB- 1 -RRB- `` Age-inappropriate sexual material '' , any description or representation , in any form , of nudity , sexuality , sexual conduct , sexual excitement , or sadomasochistic abuse , that : -LRB- a -RRB- Taken as a whole , appeals to the prurient interest of minors ; -LRB- b -RRB- Is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community with respect to what is appropriate material for minors ; and -LRB- c -RRB- Taken as a whole , lacks serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value for minors ; By adding the caveat of `` for minors '' to the already vague obscenity law language , it creates an even more difficult to define target . Now we are deciding what excites or what lacks merit for a faceless group of children . Something like Anna Karinina could be deemed as having no merit `` for minors '' as its text is mature and difficult to read , but that does n't mean a bright teenager would n't benefit from reading it . As anyone knows who has ever met more than one child , they are all different . Which is why each parent is given the responsibility to decide for their own children , instead of putting five adults together to get to pick for everyone 's kids . -LRB- a -RRB- The board shall determine whether any sexual material provided to the public by the public library is age-inappropriate sexual material . To make such determinations , the board shall convene public hearings at which members of the community may present concerns to the board . After receiving comments from the public , the board shall examine individual instances of the questioned sexual material to determine whether it is age-inappropriate sexual material under this section . -LRB- b -RRB- The board may order any material deemed to be age-inappropriate sexual material to be removed from public access by minors at the public library . -LRB- c -RRB- Any such determination or order made by the board shall be the final determination or order on such materials , and shall not be subject to any review by the governing body of the public library , the state , or any political subdivision thereof . This subdivision shall not be construed to prohibit judicial review of any determination or order made by the board under this section . Librarians study for years before they delve into collection development . But these five parents who will have absolute power that may not be appealed , are not determined by credentials , they are elected by a show of hands every two years . There is no way this will go well . As evidenced by a recent article about Florida , some people equate the mention of same-sex love with sex . Some people will feel that comics and graphic novels have no `` serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value for minors '' which our 2019 Comics in Education study shows is n't true . No one knows what 's `` age-appropriate '' because some kids are reading Harry Potter at 6 and some kids stick with Green Eggs & Ham for a couple extra years . Neither of those kids are bad , or wrong , they are just individual humans -- which is why there is already a system in place to deal with this sort of stuff . And the current system does n't put librarians in prison . Any public library personnel who willfully neglects or refuses to perform any duty imposed on a public library under this section , or who willfully violates any provision of this section , is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or by imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year . Yes , This is Censorship Beware when a politician tries to explain that something they are proposing is n't censorship -- because 90 % of the time it is exactly that . According to one local news site , Rep. Baker said , The main thing that I 've heard is that I want to ban books or ban content or censor content , and that 's not the case . I just think that there 's a line between what is open and available access for our children . Even the bill specifies it would n't be taken out of the library , it would just be put in a section that 's not for children . As we examined in a recent Kansas case where a parent objected repeatedly to LGBTQ + kids books Lily & Dunkin , I Am Jazz , and George -- moving kids books into the adult section limits the ability for kids to discover them on their own , relegating them to a section where they might as well be invisible , and send a signal to children that these books are wrong or bad . With the current system of inclusion , a child can come across books that speak to them , or spark an interest , and if their parent does n't feel they are ready , they do n't check out those books . Rep. Baker also told the local news , The main thing is I want to be able to take my kids to a library and make sure they 're in a safe environment , and that they 're not gon na be exposed to something that is objectionable material . Unfortunately , there are some libraries in the state of Missouri that have done this . And that 's a problem . No , Missouri libraries are n't offering pornography for kids . Baker is a minister and the dean of students at a local religious college . Last year he tried to get a bill passed that would allow high schools to offer electives on the new and old testaments of the Bible . Unfortunately for the rest of the religious people in the country who are n't biased , he 's probably talking about LGBTQ + books . Exemplified by the religious leader who burned an Iowa library 's copies of LGTBQ + titles This Day in June , Two Boys Kissing , Families , Families , Families ! , and Morris Micklewhite and the Tangerine Dress -- and filmed and posted the whole thing to Facebook Live -- this is a common area of contention for some religious individuals . Then again maybe Rep. Baker just really hates the Twilight series , there 's no way to know what he finds so objectionable . As Carrie Cline , Director of the Neosho Newton County Library , points out `` If it is okay with you that your child has chosen something off the shelf and wants to check it out , that 's between you and your family . I think if they have chosen something that you think is inappropriate for whatever reason , then I think that 's a great teachable moment to explain why you as a family think that that item is inappropriate , and put it back and do n't check it out . '' But Baker believes , `` I just think that we need to be careful about funding something with our taxpayer dollars without parental consent . '' Can you imagine requiring a parental committee to decide where new roads would go ? What about a parental committee to decide how much Missouri politicians make ? Parents , for better or worse , do n't get to decide where taxpayer dollars go . And the continued demystification of roles in our society is working against improving the world we live in . Parents are just other people with kids , they do n't have insight into library sciences or education . We should n't want a parental oversight committee running the kids section of a library anymore than we would want a parent 's help performing an appendicitis or prosecuting a criminal case . Maybe we 'd like a parental committee overseeing local politicians , but it 's doubtful anyone is proposing that bill .

Thrilling Combination of Dance , Song and Heartache in ` A Chorus Line ' at Welk", "content": "A Chorus Line won Best Musical , Best Book and Best Original Score in 1976 , and those watching the Welk Resort Theatre 's reprisal -LRB- through March 22 -RRB- may call it the best commercial for becoming a dancer or actor , or absolutely not . We follow 17 hopeful men and women through a strange and stressful audition for a Broadway production . The opening number `` I Hope I Get It '' is exhilarating and celebrates the tenacity of performers . We hear a rehearsal piano , dancers surge forward , and tensions grow . The dancers try to be brave but are desperate and have doubts . `` I need this job ... How many people does he need ? '' The director Zach , played with realistic presence by Jeffrey Ricca , wants a strong chorus of `` four boys and four girls . '' So the weeding process begins ; we are left in tears as the dancers hold their 8 \u00d7 10 headshots in front of them . The audition structure becomes excruciating when Zach insists on hearing their personal life stories . It 's unsettling to hear about childhood abuse and painful struggles with families , aging , and acceptance . Anthony Michael Vacio delivers a heart-wrenching soliloquy as Paul , a gay man who finds acceptance as a drag queen . A Chorus Line was gleaned from taped workshop sessions with dancers in the 70s and explores the lives of performers -- their joys and sacrifices . It made important cultural leaps that are still relevant . Set on a bare stage with mirrors , the show explores key events and decisions that grow dancers . They find beauty in ballet . They accept their sexuality and limitations . The irony is how the director pushes them to reveal personal stories , yet insists they dance as a unit and stifle their sparkling personalities . Still , we meet Diana , a Latina who felt nothing in high school drama class , and bravo to Lauren Louis in the role , leading a montage of memories with full voice , in spite of a malfunctioning microphone . Mikayla Agrella as Cassie has more energy than the sun and reminds everyone to go out there and reinvent yourself . Their stories are depressing with flashes of levity . As the sexpot Sheila , Natalie Nucci , a Welk favorite , struts like a diva and threatens to smoke on stage . As Mark , Drew Bradford never breaks character , even recalling his wet dream , confession , and drinking too much water . Holly Echsner , as Val , has jaws dropping when singing about plastic surgery . In her song best known as `` Tits and Ass , '' she explains how talent does n't count for everything ... '' Danielle Airey , as ditzy Kristine , makes singing tone deaf a comic art form , with help from a smooth-voiced Cody Walker as her adoring husband , Al. . Director/choreographer Hector Guerrero preserves the angst and passion of working dancers and actors . His cast is diverse and enthralling , and the dancing is eye-popping , from the opening -- step kick kick leap kick touch -- to the feel-good finale with the full cast of 19 in sparkling costumes . The production has Broadway energy and would be more successful with a live orchestra and interactive rehearsal piano , rather than a recording . Guerrero 's cast includes : Natalie Nucci , Jeffrey Scott Parsons , Anthony Michael Vacio , Mikayla Agrella , Jeffrey Rica , Lauren Louis , Emma Nossal , Amanda Neiman , Trevor Rex , Donny Gersonde , Katie Marshall , Danielle Airey , Sarah Morgan , Aaron Shaw , Fisher Kaake , Devon Hunt , Cody Walker , Holly Eschner and Drew Bradford . https://sandiegotickets.welkresorts.com/eventperformances.asp?evt=30# !

0.0	{"docid": "0Ns49WAr", "title": "Springfield M1A Tanker Review", "content": "The Springfield M1A Tanker is a re-creation of a gun that never really existed . The M1 Garand is perhaps the most beloved battle rifle ever fielded by the United States . Developed by John Garand , it was the epitome of a service rifle : hard-hitting and dependable in all manner of hostile environments . But it was n't perfect , and toward the end of World War II , some in the Army who were serving in the Pacific theater began looking for a shorter version for jungle combat . Who could blame them ? With its 24-inch barrel the Garand could hardly be called handy in close quarters . They wanted a version of the M1 with an 18-inch barrel , and as the story goes , more than 100 of these were produced by armorers in the Pacific , with a few sent to the States for testing and trials . This gun , the T26 , was never adopted and probably never fielded . Somewhere along the line it got the moniker `` Tanker '' hung on it -- even though the original intention had nothing to do with crews serving in tanks . Regardless , you got ta admit it was n't a half-bad idea , and Springfield Armory is paying tribute to the effort with its new M1A Tanker . Sure , Springfield 's Tanker is the 7.62 NATO/magazine-fed M1A and not the .30 -06 / clip-fed Garand , but the concept is the same . And it makes sense for Springfield , which has long been in the business of producing shortened M1As with its SOCOM lineup of carbine-length guns based on the M1A action . I like the other SOCOMs just fine , but as a hidebound traditionalist , the Tanker with its military-style walnut stock is more to my taste . It 's not totally GI , though . Springfield was smart enough to throw in some user-friendly features to appeal to modern rifle shooters . Chief among these is the front sight . Instead of a plain ol' post , the Tanker features an XS Sights post with a white stripe and a tritium insert . And the 16.25-inch barrel also has a ported muzzle , the same design you 'll find on the other SOCOMs . It incorporates two matching six/five/six rows of small ports at the 11 - and one-o'clock positions . Unlike its stablemates , though , there 's no easy way to mount an optic . Springfield does produce an excellent scope mount -- the 4th generation aluminum mount for an additional $ 155 -- but there 's no top Picatinny rail section atop the Tanker . The rear sight is the standard T105E1 , and mine required only a minor reposition to get it to `` mechanical zero '' where the index mark on the sight body is laterally centered on the index marks on the receiver . Do this by holding the elevation knob while turning out the screw on the windage knob until the latter is free to move . Then simply click the windage knob left or right to align it . It 's an article of faith with this sight system that the next procedure is to move the front sight in its dovetail to correct for windage . The front sight is held in place by a setscrew , one requiring a 7/64 Allen wrench . You 're better off with a single wrench than with a multi-wrench folder or a bit in a driver handle because there 's not a lot of clearance . If you read the printed material that comes with the Tanker , you 'll see that moving the sight 0.008 inch moves point of impact one inch at 100 yards . Ahh , but that 's for an M1A with a standard-length barrel . With the shorter Tanker barrel , according to my calculations , you need to move the sight 0.006 inch to shift your group left or right by an inch at 100 yards . Do n't forget to retighten the front-sight screw . Do this on a calm day and you now have your no-wind zero . If you retighten the windage screw so the knob does n't turn , you simply hold off for wind . Now , it 's been nearly 40 years since I pulled on a heavy shooting coat , sprayed Firm Grip on a shooting mat and competed at Camp Perry 's Highpower National Matches with an M1A -- and I did it only once -- but I did n't remember going through all this front-sight business . So I asked Vince Greiner , my old Army roommate and four-time civilian service rifle national champion , about how he handled wind . `` I always used the knobs , '' he said . And that makes more sense to me if your goal is to shoot Xs out to 600 yards . But the `` set it and forget it '' approach outlined in the literature -- basically right out of the Army M14 technical manual , which also comes in the case with the Tanker -- certainly works for a short-barreled fun/defense gun like the Tanker . The elevation knob works in one-m.o.a. increments and is marked 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 and 11 , with an un-numbered mark between each number . To zero elevation , run the sight all the way down , come up eight or so clicks and shoot a group at your zero distance -- 100 yards being typical . Adjust as necessary , and once the elevation is where you want it , turn the elevation knob counterclockwise , counting clicks as you go . When you hit bottom , you know how many clicks up it takes to be zeroed at that particular yardage . Repeat as necessary for other desired distances . Sounds antiquated , but it works . Competition shooters will run their M1A sights all the way down and then dial them up for each yard line -- 200 , 300 and 600 for standard courses of fire . If you want the numbered marks on the elevation knob to mean something -- say you want the `` 2 '' to be your 200-yard zero -- dial in your 200-yard zero , hold the knob tight and loosen the elevation knob screw entirely . Move the knob to the `` 2 '' and tighten . The Tanker 's sights are excellent , but my vision ai n't what it used to be , and it 's incredibly difficult for me to maintain a precise , consistent six-o'clock hold . I did n't win any trophies at Camp Perry more than three decades ago when my eyes were relatively good , and I surely could n't today . While the 50-yard five-shot averages I got from the bench are not great , I had enough individual good groups -- under 1.5 inches -- to know the rifle is capable of far better accuracy in hands other than mine . When I was able to find the sweet spot in my bifocals and maintain a consistent aiming point , the rifle shot quite well . Even so , this is n't a National Match gun . It 's a fun gun and a more-than-capable defensive gun . As for the latter , the combination of the white stripe and the tritium insert makes the front sight easy to pick up in most any light condition . For an off-the-rack M1A , the Tanker has a great trigger , especially considering how ancient the design is . I 'm partial to two-stage triggers in the first place , and the one on my sample broke right at 4.5 pounds and was decently consistent . About three of those pounds are taken up in the first stage , so there 's only a little over a pound left to go to break the shot . I certainly did n't have any issues with the trigger at the bench , but where it really shines is in position shooting . I burned about 100 rounds from offhand , prone , sitting and kneeling at 100 yards . Shots broke cleanly , and I was able to shoot grapefruit-size groups from prone and volleyball-size groups from sitting and kneeling at 100 yards . I also found the sights a whole lot easier to use when taking a center-mass hold instead of six o'clock . You 'd think a short .308 like this would be a handful . It 's not . Yes , the ports that do such a marvelous job of taming recoil would seriously box your ears if you fired the Tanker without hearing protection . In fact , you might even consider doubling up -LRB- plugs under muffs -RRB- if you 're shooting at a covered range . But in field shooting , the porting makes the rifle not only controllable but also comfortable . Even from standing -- the position most susceptible to recoil forces -- the gun came back on target quickly . Some of this is due to its weight . Despite the shorter barrel , the gun still weighs nearly nine pounds . The M14/M1A was a heavy gun to begin with , which is a big reason why the United States military went looking for a replacement for it in the early days of Vietnam . While a simple design , the components are heavy , which you can see once you field-strip it . To disassemble , place the rifle , sights down , on a flat surface and pull the rear of the trigger guard toward the butt and up . Then lift out the trigger group . Next , separate the barrel group from the stock . Here I discovered a slight gouge in the right side of the stock channel , possibly caused by the removal process , although I did n't feel any unusual resistance when I pulled the groups apart . With the barrel group upside down , compress the recoil spring toward the muzzle with one hand to relieve tension on the connector lock . You 'll see a pin bearing against the recoil spring guide . Just put a fingernail behind it and slide it toward you . Maintain control of the spring and its guide and lift it out . Springfield recommends the use of safety glasses for this step , and I think that 's a good idea every time you 're working on any parts that are under spring tension . To remove the operating rod , pull back on the handle until the rod 's guide lug aligns with the cutout in the guide , then pull out and up . It 's a little tricky , but it 's one of those deals where the first time you do it , as you 're wrestling with it and wonder whether you 're doing it correctly , the part suddenly comes out . Remove the bolt out toward the chamber , giving it a slight twist as you pull . No further disassembly is recommended . Reassembly is relatively easy , although at first I struggled with replacing the operating rod . The trick is you want the rod to enter the rod guide just slightly , then position the op rod hump over the bolt roller and voil\u00e0 -- it all just goes together . Like I said , you 'll see it 's a robust system , and the Tanker proved to be as reliable as every M1A I 've ever fired . At one point I mixed a number of loads in the 10-round Parkerized magazine -- from the 123-grain Lapuas to the 168-grain Winchesters -- and fired them as quickly as I could . There were no malfunctions , and that was the case throughout accuracy testing and position firing . The stock on this particular sample is a surprisingly handsome piece of walnut , with nice figuring on the butt . It 's oil-finished as befits a traditional military rifle . The stock features the hinged buttplate from the M14 . When the military switched from the M1 to the M14 , originally it was thought the latter rifle would supplant not only the M1 Garand but also the M1 Carbine , the Browning Automatic Rifle and M3 submachine gun . As such , it was a select-fire weapon , but reportedly few of these were actually issued because the M14 was a real handful in full-auto mode . Anyway , swinging up the hinged buttplate and placing it atop the shoulder was to supposed to provide additional control in full auto . Swinging it up also reveals a hinged-lid compartment designed to contain cleaning kits and chemicals . Opening the compartment on my sample required a bit of force with a non-marring tool . The stock also features sling swivel assemblies at the toe of the stock and out near the front of the fore-end . The one at the toe is fixed ; the one at the fore-end moves stiffly in its fixture and will likely loosen up with use . I wish I 'd had a traditional military sling to use with the rifle , but a simple nylon web sling worked nicely . Other features that will be familiar to M1A fans include the safety -- which moves into the trigger guard on Safe -- the paddle magazine release behind the magazine well and the bolt lock on the left side . If you 're not familiar with this design , you 'll need to learn the trick of inserting the magazine at an angle , front lip of the mag up and in first before rocking it backward into place . I really enjoyed working with this rifle -- from the satisfying `` clack ! '' you hear when you yank back on the op rod and let it fly to chamber a round , to the sweet scent of the oil-finished stock , to the authoritative feel you get when you squeeze off a round . And it checks a lot of boxes . It has all the characteristics you 'd want in a head for the hills gun : great handling , plenty of power and sufficient accuracy to get nearly any job done . It 's fun to shoot . Or it could simply be a nice addition to your gun collection because of its interesting history as the `` gun that never was .

After all , he covered the floor of Palais de Tokyo in thick white smoke , and after watching Chernobyl we all have power plants on the brain . `` Enough of the doom ! Stop it ! Enough ! '' Owens said , presented with those reflections post-show . `` It was a reaction against doom . It was camp . It was grinned determination to pursue determination . '' Grim determination ? `` Grim determination , that 's a good one , '' he quipped , oblivious to this interviewer 's fashion week hearing damage . `` I think it 's easier to complain than to be scared about things . The most moral thing to do is to get yourself together and do the best with what you 've got for as long as you 've got . It 's not selfishness , it 's about bringing something to the party ; contributing . '' In his self-penned show notes , Owens wrote about the performance gene he has detected and accepted within himself : `` At 58 , I find myself , for better or worse , performing . The difference between behaviour and performance implies falseness and rehearsal in the latter . But maybe concentration on behaviour can be a bit passively dry ? And performance a joyous contribution ? '' It explained the fetishised exuberance that permeated his collection , with all the jaunty pagoda shoulders , glamorous reptile textures , animal patterns , knitted hosiery and platform heels a Thursday afternoon could take . `` Five years ago , I would n't have looked like this . I 'm changing . I 'm not sure where it 's going and why it 's happening , but you 've got to step up and participate and contribute , '' Owens said . After years of speaking about the ecological decline that 's now everyone 's favourite sad topic , Owens is forging ahead of us all , and not only with optimism as his cure . All the plastic in the collection was sustainable . The snakeskin was n't snakeskin at all , but the `` ecological and responsible '' biproduct of the fish piracuru . `` I feel hypocritical talking about it because I 've poisoned more than I 'll ever be able to recover , '' Owens said , asked about the measures he 's taking to improve his own business . `` But the message is n't so much about sustainability and ecology . Anybody can start doing something now , even this late in the game , even after all the hypocrisy . If somebody like me can do it , anybody can start making an improvement . And that kind of effort reverberates and it affects people in the future , '' he reflected . `` It used to frustrate me .

In the latest screen version of the children 's literature classic , Dolittle , released in the US today , he is also Welsh ... or at least Wales-adjacent . Because whilst he 's still able to talk to the animals , it would appear that Dr Dolittle is not so proficient in his new native voice . More like this : - The brilliant women the Oscars ignored - What makes a Hollywood heartthrob ? - Will the Star Wars universe survive ? There was tantalisingly -LRB- and tellingly -RRB- little of Downey Jr speaking in the film 's trailer but just enough to threaten a film already beset by production issues -- a title change , reshoots , and a postponed release date -- with the heavy burden of an infamously bad accent . And now reviews have confirmed that his pronunciation is wayward , to say the least , with Vulture 's Bilge Ebiri describing it as `` an ill-advised and half-hearted Welsh accent which occasionally -LRB- and I 'm assuming inadvertently -RRB- slips into Irish , Indian and Jamaican intonations '' . The Dodgy Accent Hall of Fame -LRB- ruled over , of course , by Dick van Dyke -RRB- is a busy place . Echoing through its chambers are Russell Crowe 's not-very-Nottinghamshire Robin Hood , Anne Hathaway 's clunky ` Yorkshire ' twang in One Day , Don Cheadle 's all-gone-Pete-Tong Cockney in the Ocean 's Eleven franchise , and rather too many non-native Bostonians from The Departed cast . Recently , almost the entire cast of BBC gangster drama Peaky Blinders has been inducted . No other production seems to have generated quite the onslaught of accent-based anger as the Shelby family and their compatriots bringing cod-Brummie to the masses . Even the Scottish and Northern Irish characters have been called out for missing the mark . Our new accent fixation It seems like we 're more obsessed with analysing accents than ever before . Voice coach Eric Singer garners millions of views for his videos critiquing accents from Idris Elba to Daniel Day-Lewis to Cate Blanchett , while on the flip-side , there are some actors who assimilate so seamlessly , that the uproar comes when audiences hear them speak out of character . Killing Eve fans were shocked to hear Jodie Comer 's Liverpudlian accent in real-life after getting to know her as that show 's vocally chameleonic assassin Villanelle , who switches between Russian , French , Italian and German . And Christian Bale has played so many iconic roles using US accents -- Patrick Bateman , Batman and Dick Cheney , to name a few -- that audiences are often surprised to hear his own voice -LRB- he was born in Wales but grew up in England -RRB- when he gives interviews and awards speeches . Also , when done right , putting on an accent definitely offers a little bump to your award-season chances , as demonstrated this year by the likes of Florence Pugh and Saoirse Ronan convincingly relocating their respective British and Irish accents to 19th-Century Massachusetts for Little Women , or native Aussie Margot Robbie turning American in Bombshell and Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood . The key things to mastering an accent are courage , playfulness , a good ear , inventiveness , creativity and a real sensitivity -- Joe Windley For Rada lead voice tutor Joe Windley , the keys to mastering an accent successfully are `` courage , playfulness , a good ear , inventiveness , creativity and a real sensitivity to the diverse range of sounds that can be used in any given speech system '' -LRB- and for what it 's worth , Jodie Comer is top of his list of most vocally-skilled stars -RRB- . Meanwhile the real challenge for actors is being `` able to manifest the speech in such a way that it serves clarity and maintains authenticity '' . Classical acting training has traditionally focused on the voice being ` whole ' , meaning full of tone and fully articulate , but this is not how most people naturally speak . Recently , instead , there has been a contrasting obsession with authenticity , even though the specificity of an accent might only be noticeable to the community from which it comes . For example if the accents in Peaky Blinders sounded lightweight to locals , in the US they have proved convincingly alien enough that viewers have been switching on the subtitles . And trying to determine an ` authentic ' accent for any particular country or region is not clear-cut : even when we speak in our own accent , it can vary significantly , as we code-switch depending on what context or to whom we are speaking . A truly bad accent has always had the capacity to derail a production , yanking audiences out of the moment as it becomes impossible to look -- or should that be listen -- past . But , more than that , dodgy accents can also be morally problematic , serving to reinforce stereotypes , as explored in Hari Kondabolu 's 2017 documentary The Problem With Apu . The days when English-speaking actors put on accents and told the world they were Russian or German or Swedish or Italian -- those days are gone -- Ralph Fiennes The film looks at the Simpsons character of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon : one of the best-known -LRB- and only -RRB- representations of a south Asian person on mainstream television , but voiced by white actor Hank Azaria with a deliberately comic exaggeration that has increasingly been called out as racist . The problem of south Asian vocal caricaturing is also highlighted in Aziz Ansari 's Netflix comedy Master of None which features an episode titled Indians on TV , and deals with south Asian actors being asked to do stereotypical ` Indian ' accents at auditions . No more ` funny voices ' Accents are absolutely part of the wider debate about representation in film and TV . The idea of an accent , particularly one of a different nationality to the actor , being just a ` funny voice ' is increasingly unacceptable . When Ralph Fiennes was promoting The White Crow , his biopic of Rudolf Nureyev , he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme of his decision to cast predominantly Russian actors : `` I feel the days when English-speaking actors put on accents and told the world they were Russian or German or Swedish or Italian -- those days are gone . One has read quite a lot of critical responses to films that are still doing that , where people go , ` Have n't we had enough ? ' The landscape has shifted . '' Additionally , the deployment of accents can still be reflective of classism , and domination by the middle-and-upper classes . As actress Rebecca Humphries points out , for example , regional British accents are still sometimes used as a punchline . Humphries , who has worked at the Donmar Warehouse , National Theatre Company and the Royal Shakespeare Company , is originally from Norfolk , and is currently filming a project playing an extremely posh character , with a dialect coach on set . As a working-class person , she is conscious not to mock the accent , but says that in Shakespeare , it can be the opposite , when a broad , regional , working-class accent is frequently used for comedic roles . `` It does my utter head in , '' she says . `` To make it ` funny ' . It 's because there 's a class snobbery there that the thicker -LSB- accent you have -RSB- , the funnier you are . '' These days , actors have more reason to worry about getting their character 's chosen pronunciation right , however -- for in 2020 , film and television are not just available for consumption but for dissection . Screen-grabs and sound clips allow us to pore over performances for embarrassing mistakes , whether Quentin Tarantino 's misguided effort at Australian in Django Unchained -LRB- highlighting the perils of directing yourself -RRB- or Nicholas Cage 's Dolmio-esque Italian in Captain Corelli 's Mandolin . What we found very quickly is that actors will act accents . They will not act , they will act accents -- Craig Mazin Hence the increasingly great lengths actors go to in order to nail an accent down . Scot Martin Compston stays in his London accent throughout the four months it takes to film a series of BBC cop drama Line of Duty . Booksmart actress Beanie Feldstein worked in a Wolverhampton shop to hone the Black Country accent necessary for her lead role in the upcoming film adaptation of Caitlin Moran 's best-selling novel How to Build a Girl . Meanwhile , for the forthcoming Ohio-set film Queen & Slim , London-born Daniel Kaluuya worked at a Costco in Cleveland . As Humphries puts it : `` The thing about theatre is that that performance is then gone . But on screen , that performance is around forever , and it 's within your interests not to f**k it up . People wo n't forget it . '' However , with all the scrutiny applied to getting accents right these days , another option that has crept in very recently is to forgo the challenge by ignoring ` authenticity ' completely , and have actors simply perform in their native intonation . Such was the case with last year 's critically-acclaimed HBO series Chernobyl , which told the story of the 1985 Soviet nuclear disaster with a largely British cast speaking in various different varieties of British accent . `` What we found very quickly is that actors will act accents , '' said creator and script-writer Craig Mazin explaining the decision . `` They will not act , they will act accents , and we were losing everything about these people that we loved ... My hope is that the accent thing just fades away in seconds , and you stop caring about it . '' What is ` authentic ' ? Such a creative strategy may seem to offer a ` backlash ' against authenticity , but perhaps it 's more about the creators concentrating on being authentic to the essence of the story , rather than every tiny detail . Another example of this approach can be found in Armando Iannucci 's The Death of Stalin , where Soviet officials have accents from Brooklyn , Yorkshire and the East End . Humphries says that this option of abandoning accuracy is also becoming more common in theatre : `` For a really long time , things needed to be quite rigid and firmly in place , and now there 's this real fluidity ... If -LSB- the performance -RSB- is really good then the only people who are moaning about -LSB- accuracy -RSB- tend to be old-school purists and they 're just quite boring . '' You 've got to pump yourself full of all this knowledge about how to stand , how to speak , so that once you 're on set , with any luck , it 'll be in your body and your voice -- Rebecca Humphries However if you are going to put a different voice on , in order to avoid Mazin 's concern of `` acting accents '' , Humphries says that the key is to get to a point of feeling physically at ease . `` The idea being that you 've got to pump yourself full of all this knowledge about how to stand , how to speak , so that once you 're on set , with any luck , it 'll be in your body and your voice so that you can do the acting and the reacting -- the good stuff . '' But that process is a luxury rarely afforded to many shows , when time is short and performers have tight schedules as they move between jobs . Actor Charlie Allen explains that in theatre , there is often more of an opportunity to perfect an accent . `` If you 're doing film and TV , you 're essentially kind of on your own before you turn up on set , and you 're not necessarily getting the feedback or guidance that you would do if you were in the theatre rehearsal room . '' Brighton-born Allen has direct experience of this , facing the same challenge as the Peaky Blinders cast recently when playing a Brummie character in new play , Skin in the Game by Paul Westwood . Even more dauntingly , one performance actually took place in a community centre at the foot of the Birmingham high-rise block of flats in which the play is set . In contrast to Peaky Blinders , though , the accents went down well : `` I think I cheated a little bit because I actually have family from Birmingham , '' Allen says . `` Saying that , it 's one thing speaking to your family and speaking in your own natural rhythm -LSB- and another -RSB- when you 're picking up somebody 's play script and all of a sudden you have very specific things to say . And it was quite easy to tip over into Liverpudlian or Scouse , which we had n't even considered at all . '' To fudge or not to fudge ? However , although people might profess to crave authenticity , meticulous accuracy is n't always helpful -- or at least considered financially judicious . Often an accent can be historically accurate , while also being seen as alienating to a mass audience by the moneymen . For example , Chris Pine was mostly praised for his Scottish accent as Robert the Bruce in Netflix 's Outlaw King , but in real life , the 14th-Century Scotsman would probably have been speaking French . It is n't surprising that producers decided to forgo the confusion that would inevitably have arisen from making him a Francophone . Sometimes , either the producers or the actors themselves decide that a fudged accent , resting loosely in the vicinity of the correct pronunciation , might be the sweetest , and certainly the safest , spot for the widest possible audience to understand . The US Deep South is particularly at risk : Reese Witherspoon in Sweet Home Alabama , Julia Roberts in Charlie Wilson 's War and those of The Walking Dead cast who are n't originally from Georgia have all been called out for being generically Southern , rather than specific to the states in which they 're set . However Windley disagrees with such fudging . `` If you 're going to set it in a particular place , you really are duty bound , I think , to find the authenticity of that place , '' he says . `` But that does n't mean to say you can only cast actors who come from there . '' He prefers to talk about `` speech systems '' rather than accents or dialects , which he finds `` problematic '' terminology that fails to take in the diversity of human speech , or to acknowledge how voices are informed by age , gender , time and cultural context . The way we speak , he says , is `` a living force . It 's not an external piece of clothing that you stick on from the outside '' . Accents are not just about the voice . The accent can make you hold your head differently -- Ania Marson He continues : `` If you just study a speech system without fully exploring the context , and then you put it over the top of a situation , it will come over as phoney . '' In short , getting an accent right is a lot more complicated , say , than simply shortening a few vowel sounds and calling everyone ` duckie ' . An accent needs to be embedded into the context of the story , rather than floating around on top of the performance , connected to nothing . Actress Ania Marson agrees . She has been acting for almost six decades , most recently appearing in Killing Eve , The Alienist and Britannia . `` Accents are not just about the voice , '' she says . `` The accent can make you hold your head differently . Your whole mouth changes in order to incorporate that , so there 's a kind of physicality that takes over which is fascinating . If you 're doing it in the right way , you sort of morph into a different person . '' There are some accents in film and TV history that are almost unanimously accepted as terrible , whether because they wander like the critically panned Keanu Reeves in Bram Stoker 's Dracula , whose attempt at a posh London accent does abominable things to vowels -- or because the choice does n't ring true , like Angelina Jolie opting for a Russian-ish inflection despite Alexander 's Ancient Greek setting . Others are polarising : whether or not Robert Pattinson 's Monty-Python-esque take on the Dauphin in Netflix 's The King works probably depends on whether you thought his camply exaggerated French accent was hilarious or hideous . But how we judge accents often comes down to a subjective decision about how important we think authenticity is in any particular instance . What is crucial is that we believe the stories we are watching , and that belief comes from somewhere considerably more inscrutable than what country , region or state a character sounds like they 're from . However , considering all the potential risks that come with attempting an accent , it does seem worth asking the question , is it absolutely necessary to try putting one on in the first place ? Dr Dolittle is not , of course , a real person , and authenticity is probably not the most important element in a story about talking animals . Having said that , given that Robert Downey Jr 's voice still seems to the least believable part of it , producers might be wishing that he 'd stuck with his native New York tongue -- or at least plumped for London , given his previous experience playing Sherlock Holmes . Dolittle is released today in the US and 7 February in the UK and Ireland . Love film ? Join BBC Culture Film Club on Facebook , a community for film fanatics all over the world .

Cora would not be the former Red Sox manager today if he had n't been implicated by Major League Baseball in a pair of electronic sign-stealing schemes . His transgressions as bench coach of the Astros and , allegedly , in Boston certainly merited his departure Tuesday night . How the franchise moves forward promises to offer a stern test of character . Chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom never could have anticipated such a challenge so early in his tenure . The first formal statement issued by the club seemed to convey genuine emotion at being forced to reach such a conclusion . Wednesday 's press conference at Fenway Park brought more of the same for roughly 45 awkward minutes . Club CEO Sam Kennedy went out of his way on multiple occasions to use the phrase offered by the Red Sox on Tuesday . Boston and Cora `` mutually parted ways '' -- not a firing , not a resignation . `` It 's not ideal , '' Red Sox principal owner John Henry said . `` It 's not what we would like to be doing at this point . We were all surprised to read this report on Monday . '' Cora was named 11 times in the nine-page document released by MLB commissioner Rob Manfred to begin the week . Cora 's central role in Houston 's malfeasance brought both a personal dark cloud and one that threatened to linger over any future employer . The current MLB investigation into Boston 's 2018 champions could make Cora a two-time loser at Manfred 's office doorstep . `` Everyone acted in the best interests of the club and knew it was best to part ways , '' Kennedy said . `` -LSB- Cora -RSB- was remorseful . He apologized . '' The Red Sox had no choice . And it feels like they 're trying to give Cora an eventual chance to rehabilitate his career after he serves any potential upcoming ban from Major League Baseball . It speaks more to the human side of Cora and what he created in Boston than some of the actions that led to the end of his time here . To bestow that single label of cheater on Cora -- some sort of scarlet letter or all-encompassing epitaph for his brief tenure -- is to miss the point entirely . There are real psychological consequences to face for Red Sox staff members and players in the coming weeks and months . Cora 's two years with the club seemed to leave a personal connection not seen since Terry Francona was last at the helm in 2011 . `` My brother , more than my manager , you were a friend , a pana -LSB- pal -RSB- and advisor during these two years , '' Red Sox pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez posted on his personal Instagram page late Tuesday . `` I learned a lot from you . Thank you for everything . '' Hiring Cora to serve as Boston 's 47th manager started as an unquestioned triumph . The Red Sox were bringing in a winner , a well-liked former player who understood both the product on the field and the media game off it . Boston was also taking another significant step toward addressing its shameful overall record regarding race relations , with Cora representing its first manager of color . His debut season in 2018 was something out of a dream . Cora guided the Red Sox to a franchise-record 108 wins and playoff victories over the Yankees , Astros and Dodgers . That final Chris Sale strikeout of Manny Machado on an October night in Los Angeles seemed to make Boston immortal . In fact , it was the high point that preceded what has been a shocking 15-month fall from grace . What 's left behind most of all is uncertainty . Bloom is presiding over his first real managerial search . Players who were clearly aided by Cora 's uncanny motivational touch -- Rodriguez , Rafael Devers and Xander Bogaerts come to mind -- will be forced to find common ground quickly with the fourth Red Sox manager in a decade . Despite being handsomely paid and accustomed to the vagabond 's existence that accompanies a life in professional sports , players have feelings . They bleed . They occasionally struggle for confidence . They 're still affected by success and failure like the rest of us . Cora seemed preternaturally equipped to handle that part of the job . But it was his own thirst for victory -- his fatal professional flaw , as it turns out -- that led to his downfall . Boston 's acceptance of that fact began Wednesday afternoon , and its organizational future will be determined by what comes next . bkoch@providencejournal.com On Twitter : @BillKoch25", "url": "https://www.providencejournal.com/sports/20200115/cheater-yes-but-there-was-more-to-alex-cora", "kws": ["Alex^^Cora", "cheater", "Sam^^Kennedy", "Red^^Sox", "Xander^^Bogaerts", "grace", "Eduardo^^Rodriguez", "scarlet^^letter", "Rob^^Manfred", "bench^^coach", "Terry^^Francona", "BOSTON", "Dodgers", "Major^^League^^Baseball", "Chaim^^Bloom", "Astros", "feelings", "Yankees", "Fenway^^Park", "MLB"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"Sports": 1.0000100135803223}, "second_cat": {"Sports_Baseball": 1.0000100135803223}, "third_cat": {"Sports_Baseball_MLB": 1.0}}}
0.0	{"docid": "0Ns6MBkU", "title": "All in the FAM", "content": "In the early 1990s , somewhere `` Orlando-adjacent , '' Travis Stubbs -- an exhausted , lowly `` distributor '' for a shady company called Founders American Merchandise -LRB- FAM -RRB- -- falls asleep at the wheel , careens off the road , and gets eaten by an alligator . It could happen , but in this case it did n't . Travis is a character in the Showtime black comedy On Becoming a God in Central Florida starring Kirsten Dunst as Travis 's wife , Krystal . The gory scene where Travis gets chomped on by an alligator appears toward the end of the pilot , a pretty good omen of the surreal and deeply weird things to come . Travis 's death jumpstarts the real story : that of Krystal as a skeptical , scheming , working-class widow out not for revenge on FAM so much as survival . The show introduces the dizzying array of jargon peculiar to the world of multilevel marketing -LRB- MLM -RRB- -- a branch of the direct-selling industry that often operates a lot like pyramid schemes . The man who recruited Travis to FAM is his `` upline , '' Travis in turn recruits more distributors who constitute his `` downline . '' Travis is a true believer in FAM 's mantra that by becoming his own boss , quitting his regular J-O-B -LRB- Just-Over-Broke or Jerks-On-Board or presumably many other things -RRB- , working hard , and `` trusting the system , '' he can become fantastically rich -- by buying FAM products from his upline and selling to his downline . Meanwhile Krystal , the unsupportive wife who sees through the scam , is a `` stinker-thinker . '' In other words , the world of FAM is arcane and , on paper , would seem to make for profoundly unsexy television . Good thing then that the show is at equal turns uncomfortable and fun , replete with cheeky and dark visual metaphors for the nature of the 1990s-era world of pyramid schemes . Pelicans fall from the sky at a bargain-basement imitation of Disney World . Krystal contracts bird flu and the scene turns psychedelic as she drives from one ghost neighborhood to another , trying to recruit distributors in places where it seems everyone has been evicted . Everything is at maximum fever pitch , which makes sense : weird is a form of verisimilitude when it comes to MLMs -- as anyone familiar with the famous anti-MLM Reddit group , or with Last Week Tonight with John Oliver , or with the podcast The Dream knows well . The jargon of On Becoming a God , of course , is n't fictional . It 's the jargon of pretty much every MLM , a particular brand of an evangelizing cult that sells the prospect of wealth and success . In structure , an MLM is simple : the workforce of the company is a network of distributors , designated as independent contractors , who pay for products , rallies , access , motivational tapes , etc. , in order to recruit more distributors to buy product and recruit yet more distributors , all seemingly under the impression that the set-up is in actuality a distributor 's own business . But there 's something less simple about how the clubby , cloying homilies manage to dupe so many people . The jargon of On Becoming a God , of course , is n't fictional . It 's the jargon of pretty much every MLM , a particular brand of an evangelizing cult that sells the prospect of wealth and success to millions , despite the fact that only about 1 percent of MLM participants ever see profit of any kind . Then again , because of the gradual weakening of Federal Trade Commission -LRB- FTC -RRB- regulations over the many decades since the first MLM , Nutrilite , appeared on the scene , most MLMs have been ruled to be legal , and are not , according to the FTC , inherently synonymous with pyramid schemes . And though it was forged in Christian Evangelicalism , the modern MLM tends to downplay religious fervor , of late targeting predominantly women . Companies like Mary Kay and Avon -- and more recently , LuLaRoe -- have had great success in drawing in women by focusing on a community of interest in beauty products . The recession played no small part . In 2008 , Mary Kay launched ambitious television advertisements . In April 2011 alone , the company signed up 165,000 consultants . The following January , the company touted a 15 percent increase in sales during the previous year . The chain of evangelizing creates a faithful legion . Herbalife , the company with the third-highest revenues among all MLMs in 2017 , had approximately seventeen times as many distributors as Apple had full-time-equivalent employees in 2018 ; twenty-nine times as many as Royal Dutch Shell . Avon , with the second-highest , had forty-five times as many as Apple in 2018 , globally . The titanic disjuncture in America between the inevitability of failure and the cult-like behaviors that seek to convince people that they can become impossibly rich is a comically apt symbol for how American neoliberalism has functioned since at least the 1970s : the business as casino , the targeted conversion of particularly vulnerable demographics , the gnashing of the hopes and dreams that fell through the cracks of legal loopholes and Kafkaesque bureaucracies . More specifically , it 's a state of affairs dramatized by the immensely successful model created by the company FAM is meant to represent : Amway . The scope and scale of the damage that MLMs have wrought is unknowable , unless somehow every single former distributor were to put the extent of their damages into the public domain . But the downsides of these companies have never been much of a secret . Despite the esoteric nature of MLMs , their grip over Beltway actors have made them visible for quite some time . This is particularly true of Amway -- a company that initially sold only soap but has now become identified with the juggernaut of American evangelical conservatism . Amway was founded by two food supplement distributors for the door-to-door , direct-selling company Nutrilite , which is now owned entirely by Amway . Richard DeVos -LRB- father-in-law to Trump 's education secretary Betsy DeVos -RRB- and Jay Van Andel founded the American Way Association in Ada , Michigan , in early 1959 and later that year set up the Amway Sales Corporation and Amway Services Corporation . The key to its success , and the model it created for other MLMs , was that DeVos and Van Andel set up not one but multiple companies that were renamed several times over the years . There 's the `` Amway Corporation '' that today employs more than sixteen thousand employees . And then there 's the autonomous organization at the heart of the system : the Amway Distributors Association , originally established in 1966 , and which became the Independent Business Owners Association International , Inc. in 1999 . It is responsible for the arcane hierarchy that motivates distributors -LRB- tiers include Producer , Ruby , Sapphire , Emerald , and the deified all-but-unattainable Diamond , Multi-Diamond , and Crown tiers -RRB- . Not only does the creation of an autonomous organization lay at the heart of Amway 's economic success , it also served to differentiate Amway from old-fashioned , clearly illegal pyramid schemes . The FTC in 1979 found Amway guilty of price-fixing and exaggerating sales and earning claims , but also ruled that Amway as a whole did not meet three basic criteria for a pyramid scheme : it was based on retail sales , did not require participants to `` pay to play , '' and did not directly remunerate distributors for recruiting people . Thus , the FTC ruled , it was not a pyramid scheme . It 's evident today that this was a matter of legalese contorting itself around reality . After all , the basic idea found in MLM stories in the public domain is that the companies get things done by behaving like cults , thereby having little necessity for explicit coercion . When it came to Amway events , for instance , many former distributors have noted that attendance was implicitly required and the ticket had a fixed price ; distributors , for example , could n't cut costs on hotel reservations in the cities where rallies were held , for instance , even if they stayed with relatives . The former distributor Stephen Butterfield has written that `` for committed distributors , taking to heart the admonition that every function is vital , and wishing ` to stay plugged in , ' the claim of the organization on their time and interest is total . '' Moreover , not only is Amway essentially predicated on selling more products to distributors than they can possibly sell , its distributors are almost always customers at first who are later sweet-talked into joining . The ruse lies in convincing people that becoming a distributor is taking up an opportunity , that Amway `` just -LSB- provides -RSB- a financial vehicle to take us from where we were to where we wanted to go in life , '' as another former distributor wrote . -LRB- Twice in the Showtime version , Krystal is told , verbatim : `` Look at where you are . Think about where you want to be . '' -RRB- `` Look at where you are . Think about where you want to be . '' However clever DeVos and Van Andel were in setting up a unique model that escaped FTC strictures , it is perhaps reasonable to assume that they -- and other big MLMs -- would have gotten away with it anyway . Over the past five decades , former FTC officials have gone on to work at MLMs like Herbalife and Amway , and MLM-affiliated officials have been appointed to the FTC . One former head of the FTC was directly affiliated with Amway -LRB- during the Bush administration -RRB- . Van Andel served as the chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce from 1979 to 1980 . The DeVos family and Van Andel have given millions to the Republican National Committee -LRB- RNC -RRB- , both directly and through organizations like the Council for National Policy , Progress for America , the Acton Institute , the Heritage Foundation and hosts of other hard-right think-tanks , political groups , political campaigns , and media conglomerates . During the 1980 and 1984 elections , Amway rallies across the country were used for the express purpose of drumming up support for Ronald Reagan . Amway leaders have poured millions into every presidential election since . This has hardly been a behind-the-scenes operation . Celebrities like Bob Hope have filmed Amway TV commercials , and religious leaders like Bob Harrington and Robert Schuller have used massive Amway rallies to explicitly tie the evangelical mission to the `` free enterprise '' mission . In turn , Amway leaders such as the DeVoses have arm-twisted and shepherded through the political process conservative proposals from charter schools to right-to-work laws to anti-gay rights legislation . In 1997 , Newt Gingrich , then House Speaker , engineered a last-minute tax break of $ 283 million for the company . Gingrich is one of many prominent Republicans who has spoken at an Amway rally or conference . -LRB- Bill Clinton has praised the Direct Selling Association and Madeleine Albright has been deeply involved with Herbalife . -RRB- Indeed , at one point in the nineties , there were enough elected officials to form an informal Amway caucus in Congress . To take just one example : Sue Myrick , a former House representative for North Carolina 's ninth congressional district who joined Amway in 1992 , won election to her House seat in 1994 after speaking at hundreds of rallies where Amway leaders often passed buckets for contributions , logging the names of donating distributors . The Crown-level multimillionaire Dexter Yager used Amway 's voice-mail messaging system and his entire downline to fund Myrick 's campaign , with Myrick eventually raking in $ 295,871 through Amway ; many donors were outside Myrick 's district . Over the course of her career , Myrick oversaw much Amway-friendly legislation . If this seems less visible today , it 's partly because Amway long ago went global . By the end of the 1970s , Amway distributors had tapped Canadian , Australian , West German , English , and other international markets . But the company has also landed in hot water in other parts of the world . In 2011 , police raided multiple offices and distribution centers of Amway India , founded in 1998 , and in 2013 Amway India 's CEO and two other senior executives were arrested ; the CEO was arrested again in 2014 and 2018 . The incidents took place as a result of consumer complaints and allegations of cheating . The world of FAM in On Becoming a God is evocative of what Amway looked like in the 1990s . In a gut-wrenching turn of events , Krystal 's neighbor , Ernie , a pure-hearted , earnest believer she has conscripted into FAM , inadvertently finds himself translating for undocumented immigrants ; soon , he realizes that this vulnerable demographic , too , is in need of the `` opportunity '' he 's been given . Vice President Dan Quayle -LRB- played by an actor -RRB- shows up in another episode at an election fundraising dinner where he rubs shoulders with wealthy , Dexter Yager-like upper-level distributor Obie Garbeau II . Perhaps what is most striking about the storytelling in On Becoming a God , however , is how it goes against the grain : Krystal Stubbs , the inveterate unbeliever , tries on numerous occasions to expose or otherwise bring down FAM , but it becomes clear that it 's impossible due to the sheer burden of her poverty . What could easily have turned into a quintessentially Hollywood story about a furious woman overturning an unjust system turns into a story zooming out to show the byzantine twists and turns in a vast maze . But the show also conjures another phenomenon : that of the MLM personal story , the one plastered across the internet in anti-MLM websites , threads , essays , and blog posts -- a never-ending archive of alienation , divorce , and bankruptcy . The stories of people brought to ruination are so voluminous , in fact , that they seem to constitute a genre of their own . The narrative of the self ; telling the real personal story after having been destroyed , no matter how abject , is how many victims of pyramid schemes choose to reclaim agency in their own lives . Posters on Reddit ask for advice on how to talk to their relatives who are mixed up in a pyramid scheme , and inevitably many commenters offer advice on how to gently undo such indoctrination . Others post pictures of MLM flyers they 've torn down or defaced . Like On Becoming a God , which finds laughing at misfortune somewhat distasteful and saves the jokes for the ludicrousness of FAM , anti-MLM Reddit sees the victims of pyramid schemes , at worst , as dupes -- but dupes deserving of sympathy nonetheless . Real rancor is reserved for the superstructure . It may seem like a hokey , banal genre of woe and misfortune , but it also seems to be everywhere . In the show , one of the best episodes sees Krystal meeting with Obie Garbeau II 's wife Louise , in an attempt to grovel her way out of FAM 's grip . Louise ushers her into what can only be described as a therapeutic `` orifice . '' `` How do you feel ? '' asks Louise when the therapy is complete . Krystal 's weariness alights with barely-concealed rage as she snarls , `` I feel like ... I physically fought myself out of a fucking vagina tub for no goddamn reason . '' Louise continues to egg Krystal on for more details about her feelings , and Krystal quivers with rage , too exhausted even to restrain her eye-rolls . Dunst hunches , her face flickering from fury to a sadness she rarely allows herself to express , and shame too -- shame for debasing herself for FAM , shame for opening up to one of its figureheads . Finally , she spits out : `` I gave birth alone , because my husband was working for you . And now he 's fucking dead because of you . Because of fucking FAM ! '' Unlike the common MLM personal story , this one feels an awful lot like the speaker has been forced to give up the little dignity she 's fought so hard to retain , the rights to her own story . It 's hard to think of a better character-based way to depict how an economy of dignity has been abandoned in favor of the coercive economy of the legalized scam .", "url": "https://thebaffler.com/latest/all-in-the-fam", "kws": ["fucking^^FAM", "buying^^FAM^^products", "Travis^^Stubbs", "Celebrities", "advice", "blog^^posts", "maximum^^fever^^pitch", "revenge", "ruination", "Amway^^TV^^commercials", "Bob^^Hope", "Amway^^events", "Producer", "Krystal^^Stubbs", "multilevel^^marketing", "Disney^^World", "Amway^^distributors", "Amway^^India", "MLM^^stories", "massive^^Amway^^rallies"], "text_category": {}}

To make up for my blunder , I also contributed to the rental of a bouncy castle for our block . Did n't matter ! Everyone still got mad at me ! -RRB- On the day of the block parties , I woke up praying for a downpour that might wash out the warring parties . But as I opened my eyes , I saw the sun breaking from behind the storm clouds . And then I heard trucks rumbling down the street , followed by the pneumatic heaving of air compression machines . I walked onto our front porch . Two bouncy castles were being inflated on the street : one a bulwark at the end of our block , and the other rising ominously at the head of the neighboring block . The fortresses were in place , and the troops were beginning to organize on their respective blocks . My spouse and I have owned a house on our block for over three years and we do n't know the names of any of our neighbors . We both were raised in towns where neighbors were like extended family . As a kid you could pop in and out of neighborhood houses at will , and your parents knew the adults on the block so well that they could gossip for hours about their sexual peccadillos . When we first learned of the block party , we were looking forward to it as a way to get to know our neighbors . But as the drama over the warring block parties escalated -- something I normally would enjoy -- I found myself growing disengaged . There was a time when I was younger that I would have happily waded into the conflict . I would have played kingmaker , working impishly behind the scenes to elevate one of the competing party organizers . `` I think I 'm getting old , '' I told my spouse , who had joined me on the front porch to watch as party organizers on our sister block arranged food tables and stared daggers at the organizers on our block . `` I 'm not enjoying any of this . '' Most of our neighbors are a decade younger than us , and the animus between the two blocks seems largely rooted in parenting turf battles . We feel both superior and rejected for not being dragged into the infighting . `` Just be happy that we 're more mature than the rest of them , '' my spouse said . Immediately after she spoke , a dark cloud appeared in the form of the antisocial lesbians who live next door . We have been locked in a quiet melodrama with these nuts since we bought our place . They refuse to acknowledge us when we say hello , and we suspect that they stole the fairy lights in our backyard because the light was penetrating the blackout curtains covering their windows . `` It 's the Sisters Grimm , '' I whispered to my spouse as the women lumbered toward us . `` Heard you got in trouble for donating to the other block 's bouncy castle , '' the bigger of the two said by way of introduction . `` We did , too . '' `` We do n't have kids . We do n't understand the politics of block parties , '' the other said . `` Now everyone on both blocks hates us . '' `` Us , too ! '' my spouse and I said in unison . `` Well , I guess there 's only one thing to do , '' said the bigger one . `` We paid for them . So let 's storm the castles . '' And with that , peace came to the 1300 and 1400 blocks of Seward Street as the warring factions of suburban parents were united by their collective outrage at watching four middle-aged lesbians jump with abandon in their bouncy castles .", "url": "https://www.lavendermagazine.com/our-lives/the-block-party-final-episode/", "kws": ["block^^parties", "episodes", "Seward^^Street", "party^^organizers", "storm^^clouds", "neighborhood^^houses", "stared^^daggers", "Grimm", "the^^sun", "unison", "kingmaker", "trucks", "gossip", "extended^^family", "eyes", "parenting^^turf^^battles", "suburban^^parents", "food^^tables", "kids"], "text_category": {}}

His work is really visionary , and I do n't recall seeing it elsewhere . Thank you ! REBECCA CURTIS An Unwanted Duck Springs January 13 , 2020 Thanks to a united effort by people across Long Island , three animals in distress were saved -LRB- Jan. 1 , 2020 -RRB- . The domestic ducks stranded on our Nature Trail were in bad shape ; all three were emaciated , and one had a severely broken foot . They were the only three survivors of a dumping that took place in November , where six domestics `` appeared '' alongside the wildlife , left behind by someone who no longer had need of them . Animal rescue has never been a competition . There are no grand awards given to volunteers , no payment beyond the satisfaction of helping a creature in need . There is a long history of farmyard ducks being neglected , with wildlife rehabs turning them away due to their domesticity , and animal shelters having no place for them . Rather than taking the time to rehome an unwanted duck -LRB- or several -RRB- , many drop them where their wild cousins reside , assuming all will be well . Domestic ducks can not fly or forage like their natural-born ancestors , and they lack the genetic resilience against many diseases found in the wild -- parasites , infections , and the like . With nowhere to go , nearly all of them perish within months , or sometimes scant weeks , of their initial abandonment . Disturbingly , this happens so often that many never notice . They 'll see a white duck in March that disappears by April , and another white duck several months down the line . Surely it must be the same animal ? The reality is much more somber : That initial white duck -LRB- a Pekin , with a heavy , flightless body bred for meat production -RRB- has long since been killed , and a newly abandoned animal has taken its place . We do not have an established population of domestics . Instead , we have an ever-revolving door of animals being left to fend for themselves , creating an endless cycle of abuse , neglect , and tragedy . They are attacked by predators , hit by cars , stricken with illness , and starved , only to be replaced by another helpless creature in short order . Anyone who loves animals should be appalled by this . I have rehomed over 10 domestic ducks in the past year alone . They were all thin and terrified , unsure of why the lives they 'd always known had been abruptly upended . Now I am provided with regular updates on their welfare , and I joyfully watch them flourish , delighting in their comfortable new lives . In a world where social media reign supreme , it 's a simple matter to find a good home for a duck in need , which means there 's no excuse for illegal abandonment . Our Christmastime duck friends are going to make a full recovery . The male rouen and female cayuga are gaining weight , filling out in places where they were nearly skeletal before . The female Pekin has a more difficult road ahead , with a fungal infection settled deep into her lungs and a broken foot , but her prognosis is good . According to her veterinarian , the clean break in her toe was likely caused by the bars of a small metal cage . Now she 's roaming on lush grass , lounging in a predator-proof coop , and doing what ducks do best : Eating her fill of nutritious food . To those who donated time , money , and words of kindness throughout this rescue , I offer my sincere thanks . Three lives have been saved , and in the eyes of many , those lives were worth saving . Warm regards , MEGHAN BAMBRICK Support for Dell Montauk January 13 , 2020 Local animal advocate Dell Cullum is engaged in a dispute with Long Island Orchestrating for Nature about ducks in the East Hampton Village Nature Trail . I do not have firsthand knowledge of the dispute . I simply want to emphasize what so many people know : Dell is devoted to the Nature Trail and its nonhuman inhabitants and has extensive knowledge about their behavior and well-being . Dell has written a beautiful , heart-felt book about the Nature Trail titled `` Eden of East Hampton , '' and he has worked tirelessly to rescue and humanely relocate animals throughout East Hampton . In 2015 , he was the first person to call attention to the death and suffering of deer as a consequence of the sterilization program . Dell is truly a hero to the animals . Community support for Dell is vital as the effort to protect our animal relatives goes forward . BILL CRAIN Wild Injustice East Hampton January 13 , 2020 Craziest thing happened this past weekend . I received a call from a stranger in the Kings Park area . She told me that I needed to come UpIsland and check on these ducks at their local pond , where they flock to be fed by nature-loving folks . She had no previous training in identifying duck injuries , but just knew something was amiss . I asked her if there were other animal organizations in the area that might be able to help . She said there were a few , but she felt it was necessary that I come , disrespecting the other groups , who are probably most knowledgeable about the area , and just step on their toes , then over their heads , and just do as I please . I thought to myself that sounds like a perfectly normal and respectful request so I packed up my gear and headed west . When I arrived I just could n't believe what I saw . So many ducks in one spot , and not one looked happy . In fact , I could n't find one smile in the entire brace . It was a most pitiful scene , equaled only by the horrible visuals the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals shows me every evening at dinner time . I sat there and cried for 10 full minutes at the horror , and knew I had to make a change . Who protects these poor wild animals from the dangers of the wild , I thought to myself . Then I turned and saw an information sign that clearly had a help line to a local nonprofit organization , but that did n't answer my question . My question was what resource was available to protect these creatures ? Certainly a human organization should have been assigned to this area to unnecessarily impact the wildlife and disrupt the natural flow of nature . But no , this place was running purely on nature 's instinct and the wildlife 's natural behavior , and this was absolutely unacceptable . That 's when I vowed to be the hero , and make a change so desperately needed . With 30 years ' experience , I felt it best to proceed without a plan . This would create the most risk and danger to the animals ; however , there were a lot of ducks to be rescued , and I had to get this ball rolling . I thought about contacting the local police to see if they would stand by me while I infiltrated their town and created an absolute circus . Then I thought about contacting the county 's S.P.C.A. , but they were already out strong-arming another legitimate do-good organization , so I chose to knock this out on my own . So again , with all the experience I needed and using absolutely none of it , I grabbed my big metal net pole and started chasing and swinging . I had several dozen ducks desperately in need of medical attention running around in a panic as I chased them aggressively with my net and pole . The ones that got exhausted from stress quickly fell motionless , and those are the ones I scooped up first . I figured I 'd grab the ones I could catch , and they would be the ones that needed the most help . A few I accidentally hit with my metal net , so if they were n't in need of help , they were now . But that 's okay , because I was there , and everything was going to be okay . At the end of the day , my results were as follows : I rescued and saved 30 wild ducks from the dangerous wild . Why anyone would think a wild duck could survive in the wild is beyond me , but that 's why I 've dedicated my life to these poor and helpless creatures of the wetlands and public feeding ponds . Five of my patients had cold feet , another five had hangnails , while 10 others had a few missing feathers . The remaining 10 ducks I saved had much more serious issues . Two were abusing duckweed and needed substance abuse counseling , three more were bipolar . One poor mallard suffered from schizophrenia and thought it was a black duck , two others had anger control issues , while the remaining two simply had self-esteem problems and were showing signs of wanting to give up . There were a few others with visible body lacerations , some with bumble foot , and one with a broken wing , but those ducks were really hard to catch so , after an hour or more of chasing them around I decided to let them heal naturally . After all , I had the worst of the lot , and I felt I had done a great thing for this town I 'd never been to before , nor had any previous connections to . I crammed all the ducks into small crates then into my vehicle for a long drive back home . Just before I was leaving , a gentleman showed up with a camera , so I quickly grabbed a nearby duck , and as the duck wailed in panic trying to break free from my human grasp , I held it tight to my breast as if I were comforting a human baby . I 'm hoping the local paper will get hold of that photo . It really captured the fright-filled bond I made that day with all the waterfowl . I took lots of photos of the rescued ducks , along with their inflictions , but I ca n't show them to anyone . The wild ducks are now residing at a non-wild and unnatural facility where they finally live a life of confusion and displacement . Oh , but I ca n't tell you where that location is either . I could n't be prouder of my accomplishments in this matter . I 'm now eager to ambush another strange town and disrupt their wildlife as well , with fraudulent claims of distress . Now , with all sarcasm aside , let me leave you with a little true fact about mallards . Mallards will often pair up with their mate in October and November , and will stay together until the end of the breeding season -LRB- from March to May -RRB- . They are generally monogamous , while some are seasonally monogamous . Either way , those ducks removed from the duck pond in December/January , were more than likely separated from their mates . This is the result of LION 's inexperience and lack of knowledge necessary to be proper stewards of our animals -LRB- either wild or domestic -RRB- . Suffolk County S.P.C.A. should have known better as well , but then again , they have no business being involved with wild animals and really just added fuel to an already disastrous fire of wild injustice . LION also took away the mallard with melanism , who I 've been using as a learning subject for children and adults who I lead learning tours for at the Nature Trail . This animal could n't have been healthier and was obviously misidentified as a farm-raised cross-bred mallard . Again , their lack of knowledge created a loss for our local education program . I want to thank the East Hampton Village Board for again standing around like mutes and allowing this to happen . Then again , if things continue in the village as they have been , perhaps in five years the Nature Trail will be eliminated , filled in , graded over , and replaced with an Abercrombie & Fitch , where you 'll be able to purchase a duck down parka for under $ 400 . DELL CULLUM Wildlife Rescue of East Hampton Not a Seal Amagansett January 9 , 2020 Congratulations to the Village of East Hampton as it celebrates 100 years of incorporation . The recent edition of The Star reported on the new seal unveiled by the village board , displayed on a new village flag . As this community and The Star usually maintain a high level of discourse , permit me the following comments . Historically , a seal refers to a graphic device stamped into wax or lead utilized to indicate authority or authenticity . As such , the graphic devices are necessarily very simple -LRB- as they are relatively small , sometimes part of a ring -RRB- , based on shapes defined only by lines , and monochromatic -LRB- only the color of the material is present , the image made visible by the shadows generated by the impression -RRB- . With time , new devices , symbols or logos , began to be used by entities to provide a mark of identity and differentiation . These symbols have a richer palette of possible shapes and colors and today are omnipresent in all sorts of communications : print , TV , cell , computer screens , video , etc. . Yet they still have very real parameters of legibility , determined by the size relative to the distance observed , media of transmission , screen resolution , etc. . Such symbols are carefully designed by professional designers who are trained in considering all the implications of applying an official logo in a variety of applications , materials , and circumstances . It is important that such a symbol be effective in all situations , not only to be effective in fulfilling its function , but in order to ensure effective use of the substantial resources invested in these efforts . -LRB- A logo will be applied in a myriad of applications over a long period of time and represents a surprisingly large investment of resources and `` brand '' value . -RRB- Art is something else , created by practitioners with different skill sets , serving a different set of objectives . The image displayed on the new village flag may be art , but it is certainly not a seal . When reduced dramatically in size to be used in various applications -LRB- stationery , newspaper ads , town ordinance signs , and stickers -RRB- or reduced to monochromatic applications -LRB- full color reproduction is not always possible -RRB- it simply will not work . It will not be legible -- the minimal criterion for the success of a seal or logo . The artist involved , Mr. Bluedorn , confirmed that this was the first time he had been asked to create `` something so official . '' I have no criticism of him . It is certainly a pretty drawing . But I hope that in the future , village board members will consider all the implications of required professional expertise before using public funds to commission work . Maybe in 2120 . DAVID GROSSMAN Advantage Naples , Fla. . January 9 , 2020 With five months to go before the village 's mayoral election , it is questionable policy to appoint a new mayor for the next six months . The deputy mayor has had ample time -LRB- since July -RRB- to prepare for filling in the mayor 's role for this time period until the people of the village decide in June who should be their mayor . If the appointment goes to one of the candidates running for mayor , it can clearly mostly be seen as a blatant maneuver that attempts to give the advantage of incumbency to a candidate during the upcoming election . It just does n't pass the sniff test . I would advise against it . Sincerely , A.M. BUTLER Questions Bridgehampton January 8 , 2020 There is a very important election to occur in our beloved East Hampton Village this summer . Has the current mayor given a reason he is not fulfilling his term ? Seems odd to me and that there could be some political reasons for this . I think questions need to be asked and answered here . ADAM M. MILLER Rigging Berwick , Me . January 8 , 2020 Clearly an attempt at rigging the election in favor of Barbara Borsack . Everyone knows incumbents have a higher likelyhood of re-election . The current mayor is playing the residents for fools . A fair election , and let him endorse his candidate of choice -LRB- if he chooses to -RRB- , not play games like this . That should piss off every East Hampton voter . KEVIN D. GRAY Unfair East Hampton January 7 , 2020 To The Star : Appointing a new village mayor now is inappropriate seeing as there will be elections in five months ' time . We need to keep the election process open and honest without giving anyone an unfair advantage . I may not live in the Village of East Hampton , but I work , shop , and spend my money there , and local politics do affect me . Sincerely , JACQUELINE DUNPHY An Edge Wainscott January 7 , 2020 To The Star : With five months to go before the village 's mayoral election , it is inappropriate to appoint a new mayor during this time . This appointment would clearly be seen as to give Ms. Borsack an edge during an election . Sincerely , GARY WALEKO -- This letter was generated via an automated link on a group email sent by Jerry Larsen , a former East Hampton Village police chief running for village mayor in the June election . In addition to Mr. Waleko , 12 other people submitted the same letter . The Star asks that letters be written by their signers and be unique . Ed . Rubber-Stamping East Hampton January 10 , 2020 Dear David , The bottom line regarding these sand mines across the East End is not whether they are polluting the groundwater , they are . Neither is it the up-in-arms citizens groups and evidence of contamination in health reports done by the Suffolk County Health Department . Nor is it the tree huggers versus big business . `` The buck stops here '' were the very words of one of their own people in charge of issuing permits like candy to sand-mine operators since the first mine was dug . So the buck indeed stops , as it stands , with the State Department of Environmental Conservation , but not in the arrogant capacity their mining permit person insisted . Rather , that power needs an end date . The D.E.C. is more than at fault , it is a rubber-stamping agency for wealthy sand-mine owners , if truth be told . You know it , and I know it ; they obviously brag about knowing it . And how dare anyone challenge them , is their attitude . We dare . Time for those stone-age walls to be knocked down . They have not been following their own protocol in sand-mining permit applications and renewals . No water testing is done . And no one is allowed on private property to test the water . They sit on their throne granting these permits to mine sand , continuously disturbing the groundwater for years and years . It has taken its toll . It 's time to be done . Our only filter out here between clean drinking water and toxic chemicals is our sole source aquifer , which is in jeopardy . Allowing further interference with the aquifer is criminal . You can only treat water to a degree and then it 's useless to do so . The D.E.C. can deny until the cows come home that they did nothing wrong . It 's all in the evidence , all in the paperwork where time and time again `` no impact '' to the environment -LRB- i.e. , the aquifer -RRB- is declared . Lawyer up all you want , the facts are there . Sand Land in Noyac is the precedent . The damage is done . Close it . And then deny any further permits to violate our aquifer at the other sand mines in East Hampton and elsewhere out here . Enough . The towns must take their power back from the D.E.C. concerning sand mining . The people have spoken . The experts have spoken . It is time for the judge in the Sand Land case to do the right thing . Before we have a health crisis from polluted drinking water . Before the aquifer , which was deemed to be protected above industry and man 's greed , is polluted for good . This is a huge wake-up call to those who were asleep . The harbinger of a toxic water disaster is upon us . Heed the facts , and do n't let the D.E.C. continue to permit these sand mines to operate . You 've been warned . Sincerely , NANCI LAGARENNE Car Wash Springs January 12 , 2020 Dear David , As a longtime educator who , when I was in private school , one of my tasks as a teacher of humanities was to establish the meanings of the attributes of a culture . Leading the list of attributes was a government defined as taking care of the needs of the people . In our town , the governing body , our town board , has set up different groups called boards , i.e. : planning board , zoning board , etc. , to supervise difference parts of that duty . Each has a specific duty . Appearing before the planning board recently , I stated my objections to a car wash . Putting aside my in-depth understanding of our fragile aquifer as a hostess of a local LTV program , the developers of this project -LRB- How much money can I make off the quality of life issues of East Hampton , especially the hamlet Springs ? -RRB- are dead wrong . The location near the dump , with its own traffic , a future bus depot , and perhaps the busiest section of road , Springs-Fireplace Road , there is in East Hampton , is truly ridiculous . We do n't need it ! We do n't want it ! And we have done very well without it . The Board of Cooperative Educational Services predicts as we become more of a second-home community and population subsides , our needs will change . People are not going to come out for a weekend and get their cars washed . Let 's hope these boards and our government will do their jobs and take care of the needs of the people who live in East Hampton and especially the long underserved hamlet of Springs . Sincerely , PHYLLIS ITALIANO Tipping Point Sag Harbor January 7 , 2020 Dear David , I am totally sympathetic with Manny Vilar who wrote in his letter to The Star last week , `` Sadly , East Hampton is on track to be a summer version of Palm Beach , where the work force commutes in but can not afford to live . '' Here in Sag Harbor , Save Sag Harbor held a New Year 's Day fund-raiser at which their members congratulated themselves on having avoided the `` East Hampton trap , '' by which they meant we had avoided the plague visited on East Hampton by Donald Zucker , who bought up many properties on Main Street , rented them out to very high-end retailers , and gutted the village of its charming mom-and-pop stores . -LRB- Zucker has just bought a chunk of our own Main Street and is about to wreak his particularly nasty brand of `` upscaling '' here . -RRB- But landlords like Zucker can not charge high rents to retailers unless there is a market for the types of stores he rents to . And that market comes not from those of us who actually make up the citizenry of Sag Harbor , just as no one who is a year-round resident of East Hampton can afford to shop in Zucker 's tenants ' stores . A village like East Hampton -- and now , Sag Harbor -- loses far more than affordable shops when this sort of upscaling happens . What attracts landlords like Zucker and all that follows in his wake is a rash of building for second-home owners . Why ? Because these people do not consider our villages their homes . They do not participate in our community affairs . They do not send their children to our schools . They do not volunteer in our charitable organizations . They do not even subscribe to our newspapers . Instead , they invite their city friends and family to sit around their pools and perhaps go out for overpriced dinners at our restaurants . We have reached a tipping point . We now have enough second-home owners that they are determining our economy . They have driven up the prices in our restaurants , our shops , our theaters , even our gas stations . They have driven up the cost of housing and the cost of raw land . Businesses whose owners do not live and pay taxes in our villages are happy to serve these people , but we who live here have lost our restaurants , our pizza places , our affordable shops . It is understandable that the village governments do not care to stop this trend : People who pay high property taxes yet do not send their children to our schools represent a net financial gain . But what is lost to us is the sense of community , the one-for-all-and-all-for-one quality of life of a small community of neighbors who know and love one another . If there were the will to do this , the powerful tide of second-home owners could be stemmed . Small towns and cities all over this country are doing this . So is the brilliant city of Tel Aviv . And in New York City , this method of shifting the balance of housing costs is about to be implemented to make more of the city 's housing stock available to the people who work there . Two years ago , Tel Aviv realized that more and more luxury condos were being built in the city , while fewer and fewer Tel Avivians could afford to live near where they worked . European Jews , fearful of anti-Semitism , were buying up clusters of apartments as a hedge against having to suddenly migrate to Israel . The city answered promptly by levying tripled property taxes on apartments that were not owner occupied at least half the year . What would happen if Sag Harbor and East Hampton did the same ? Those who want to live in luxury would find another place to build their McMansions . They would dine out elsewhere . They would shop elsewhere . Property prices in our villages would drop , and so would all the costs of living for those of us who are still trying to live here . This does not mean that businesses would be driven out . It means they would have to sell more affordable meals and merchandise , sell to those of us who make up the real heart of our communities . Not so bad , really . Do our local governments have the will to do this ? SUSAN PASHMAN Insult to Injury Springs January 13 , 2020 Outrageous is a word I have heard many times ever since your article in the Jan. 9 Star titled `` Gansett Meadow Move-In Ready in 2020 '' was printed . What has everyone fired up is the realization that the town 's affordable housing program will not be for struggling local East Hampton residents , such as our struggling volunteer first responders . According to Catherine Casey , executive director of the East Hampton Housing Authority , `` Applicants will be divided into four groups : Suffolk residents with no preference , Suffolk residents with preference , non-Suffolk residents , and non-Suffolk residents with preference . '' Ms. Casey further stated `` that the town had anticipated that firefighters would also be given preference , but the state is not likely to allow it . '' Additionally , Ms. Casey states , New York State asked the town Housing Authority for a lot of demographic data , and firefighters are very white and male . The state 's not comfortable because they feel that it would give an edge to racial demographics . To add insult to injury , Supervisor Peter Van Scoyoc is quoted in another story in your paper touting at the `` state of the town '' address the town board 's affordable housing achievements , `` 50 new affordable-housing units under construction or recently completed , and a total of 22 acres of land acquired to develop more and that the town has produced more units of affordable housing per capita than any other town on Long Island . '' Then lastly , in another story , you report that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo vetoed legislation sponsored by Assemblymen Fred W. Thiele Jr. and Tony Palumbo and Senator Kenneth P. LaValle . The legislation , which was something I personally championed while in Albany but am unaware of a single town official doing the same , authorized towns in the Peconic Bay region to establish community housing funds to be funded by a supplemental real estate transfer tax . Additionally , the legislation would have ; 1 . Formed an advisory board in any town that has created a community housing fund to review and make recommendations regarding the town 's community housing plan . 2 . Would have allowed residents of the five East End towns to vote on imposing a 0.5-percent real estate transfer tax to create the Peconic Bay Community Housing Fund . 3 . It would have established a funding source to be used to build new housing and rehabilitate existing houses for affordable programs . 4 . Provided financial assistance to first-time home buyers , to create public-private partnerships to develop housing . 5 . It would have created a counseling service to assist potential buyers . There is nothing we can do about the governor 's veto other then resubmit the legislation and try again . But as far as the town board goes , there needs to be full disclosure and accountability . The town board has a credibility problem , and it would appear that pursuing political housing ideology is more important than the needs of our local struggling families . The town board needs to come clean and answer these three simple questions . 1 . Did the town board know this prior ? 2 . If the town board did , why did they not share this with the community ? 3 . If the town board did not know this , then why not ? Many of us understand federal , state , and county money comes with conditions , which is why the Thiele and Palumbo and LaValle legislation was so important . Where many of us feel betrayed and misled is the fact that the conditions cited by Ms. Casey were not disclosed . The current elected town board members campaigned on creating affordable housing for East Hampton residents , in particular , our firefighters , emergency medical technicians , and ocean rescue volunteers . At no point has anyone of our elected super majority 5-to-0 Democratic town board members told us that East Hampton residents would be at best disenfranchised , at worst discriminated against in favor of non-local residents from out of town . This is outrageous and is not representative of East Hampton values but rather national political ideology over our struggling local community . The East Hampton Republican Committee is the local party dedicated to working families , a living wage , environmental conservation , and economic development . We believe in bipartisan solutions regardless of financial status or political party affiliation . Access to the government should not be based on what you can afford or how much you donate to a national or local political party . Town government should be fair , equitable , open , and transparent to all . Come and check us out at our next monthly meeting . We will not judge , nor will we demand that you follow a national , state , or New York City political doctrine . Let us work together for a better East Hampton for all . MANNY VILAR Chairman East Hampton Town Republican Committee Against Humanity Amagansett January 13 , 2020 Dear Mr. Rattray : I would like to thank The Star , and reporter Christopher Walsh , for printing the very nicely written article about the -LRB- pick one -RRB- old guy , fool , goof , oddball , visionary standing outside Town Hall with signs . For the past two Fridays I have been in front of Town Hall with signs about the existential global climate crisis . Week one , I received very limited response and was alone . Week two , alone again , but had a visit from Supervisor Peter Van Scoyoc . We had a pleasant and interesting conversation , climate related . He gave me some encouragement , which I really appreciated . I also had 21 horn honks -LRB- some did a two-tap -RRB- and numerous waves and thumbs-up from passing vehicles . These were also appreciated . I 'm standing there trying to raise local awareness of a global problem and rising global movement . `` Fridays for Future/Fridays for Climate Change '' was begun over 73 weeks ago in Sweden by a young lady named Greta Thunberg . She has become an inspiration for millions , with more seeing the peril every day . Her message is simple -- pay attention to the science and we must act now . As Greta asks , and I ask , do n't listen to us : Wake up to the science ! Nearly everyone has a phone and/or a computer ! Do the research , read about the science from legitimate sources , learn , and be very afraid ! The numbers and prognosis are frightening . The future of our children 's children 's children is on the line . The one number that has struck me the most in my own research is our daily emissions of carbon into the atmosphere -- 200 billion pounds per day ! Two x 10 to the 11th . Here 's what that looks like -- 200,000,000,000 . Every day we delay is exacerbating and accelerating the destruction of the only place we know of to live . Every day we fail to act makes attempts to repair the damage more difficult . We are answerable to our children and descendants . What will our children be able to say to their children that we did when we knew ? Knowing this and failing to act would be a crime against humanity ! Failing to act would be evil ! But we are not evil ! We 're good , and we can do anything together ! But we need to become aware that this is truly an existential environmental crisis ! Time to wake up . We , the people , in order to form a more perfect union with the world and each other . The choice is ours . It 's going to take a monumental effort to clean up the mess we have made , and we 're going to have to do it together ! I will be in front of Town Hall every Friday at 9 a.m. Please come stand with me to meet like-minded people , converse , and make some noise . Let 's make lots of noise ! Forgive me if this sounds self-righteous or preachy ; I 'm scared . Scared not enough people will awaken to the seriousness of this crisis in time to act . Not for me , I 'll be dead . For all the beautiful children I see everywhere . And all the mothers . And all the fathers . And life . I 'm on Facebook if you want to message me for more info or to join the fight . Please , no haters or deniers ; I 've heard enough of that already . HARRY LAGARENNE Personal Attacks Wainscott January 13 , 202 Looks like the unquestioning pro-Deepwater Wind crowd has unleashed Plan C to aid their partner Orsted run a high-power electric cable throughout a residential neighborhood : Personal intimidation and character assassination . The group whose founder was also the co-founder of Win With Wind -- who promised to bring facts to the debate about the South Fork Wind Farm -- ran an ad in The Star last week attacking supporters and advisers to the Citizens for the Preservation of Wainscott . Clearly unwilling to debate the merits of the high voltage cable landing site in a residential neighborhood , they decided that their cause permitted them to try to maliciously and recklessly harm their fellow citizens ' reputations . The effort had no other purpose than to try to silence them and the more than 1,300 Wainscott community members who signed their petition . Whatever the merits of the pro-Orsted group 's goals , outlandish personal attacks against fellow citizens discredits their `` movement '' and the South Fork Wind Farm project . One would hope these scandalous attacks are not consistent with Orsted 's corporate values and fair dealing with local communities and should be disavowed by Orsted publicly and immediately . Unless , of course , Orsted tacitly supports these thuggish tactics in a win-at-any-cost effort to missinform and divide our community . Now would be an opportune time for them to make it clear where they stand . MICHAEL ELKINS Latest Hypocrisy Wainscott January 13 , 2020 To The Star : Orsted supporters have now , ironically , adopted scorched-earth tactics as the opposition to Orsted 's proposed landing site for a massive electrical cable project builds and the tough questions are asked . Win With Wind and its other offshoots preach the need to be fact-based , but spend most of their time trying to foment some form of class warfare . Their latest hypocrisy is to run a hate-filled ad with multiple high-pitched accusations against volunteers in a grassroots and broadly supported Wainscott community group . The main thrust of their argument is that opposition to the Orsted project is filled with class enemies who simply have no right to join the public debate because they have `` deep pockets '' and are `` wealthy Wainscott millionaires . '' This is civil discourse ? Those are facts ? Among many other errors , they raise a bizarre Ukrainian connection and include a local politician who is not even part of the group ! This is the latest unhinged outburst from the co-founders of Win With Wind . Among their two prior contributions to the debate were : 1 . Attending a Wainscott Citizens Advisory Committee meeting in June 2019 to berate the 100-plus attendees who vitally care about the future of Wainscott , accusing them of being selfish and then walking out of the meeting before the presentations were completed -LRB- only to have to clarify her statement two weeks later in a letter to the editor after getting called out for it -RRB- ; 2 . Running another ad in The East Hampton Star in November 2019 accusing all 1,300 Wainscott community members of being `` wealthy millionaires '' and selfish for blocking the will of Orsted to run a powerful electric cable through their residential community . Hopefully they now feel ashamed of starting personal attacks and attempting character assassination . Educators really should know better . PAMELA MAHONEY To Buy Ads Wainscott January 12 , 2020 Dear David , You happy now ? You write a nutty and dangerous editorial trying to `` expose '' the founders of a grassroots community organization opposed to landing Deepwater Wind 's power cable in Wainscott , and now you get your readers to buy ads in your paper attacking them personally ? Wonder if you even gave them a discount . Shameful . MITCH SOLOMON Sad Attempt Wainscott January 13 , 2020 To The Star : Does the end justify the means ? A group started by one of the Win With Wind co-founders has stooped to a new level of base discourse in our community . Running ads designed to individually stigmatize several community members who have -- with the community 's support -- stood up to a corporation with an arrogant plan to run a power cable through their residential community . The ads are a sad attempt to stifle debate ; they do not even attempt to engage in a discussion on the merits . Yes , the U.S. needs to take action on climate change -LRB- starting with conservation , reduced energy usage , and alternative energy sources -RRB- . But that does not mean running over anyone in your way . Orsted supporters are now resorting to mean public denunciations and intimidation -- riddled with errors , too -- of those who would dare oppose Orsted . Thank you , JORDAN TERAMO Patently False East Hampton January 13 , 2020 Your editorial in the Jan. 2 issue of The Star continues to blame President Trump for embracing anti-Semitism . You wrote that President Trump embraced the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville , Va. , in 2017 , declaring that some of them were `` very fine people . '' This is patently false . He specifically condemned the neo-Nazis . Check his speech . He was , instead , referring to protesters in Charlottesville who were divided into two groups : those who wanted to take down the statue of Robert E. Lee and those who wanted it to remain standing . About these two groups he said : `` There were fine people on both sides . '' The president 's remarks about Jews in the real estate business were initially as you quoted , but he went on to say that `` Americans need to learn to love Israel more because you have people that are Jewish people , that are great people -- they do n't love Israel enough . '' Why was this comment left out ? Very often I find his honesty and lack of polish refreshing , and occasionally I wish he would think a little more carefully before he speaks . You mention that white supremacists have been brought into the White House by President Trump , but again no examples are mentioned . Were you happy with President Obama 's close relationship with the Rev. Wright -LRB- `` Gd Damn America '' -RRB- or with the frequent visits to the White House of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson , two anti-Semites ? I applaud your paper 's policy of printing all letters to the editor ; I 'm benefiting from this policy now , but America will always be divided politically , as we have always been ! Only totalitarian countries have unanimity of opinion , because opposing views to the government 's are suppressed . Nevertheless , the editor has the responsibility , in my opinion , to present facts when he is making charges about our elected officials . Best wishes , ELAINE EVANS Zeldin 's Failure Springs January 13 , 2020 Dear David : This morning , in a bald-faced lie , Mr. Trump claimed that he `` was the person who saved pre-existing conditions in your healthcare . '' This ludicrous claim came in apparent response to an ad by the Bloomberg campaign lambasting Mr. Trump for his efforts to eradicate the Affordable Care Act -LRB- Obamacare -RRB- . We all remember the G.O.P. 's efforts to derail the A.C.A. and replace it with the American Healthcare Act . And we all remember the G.O.P. representatives being cheered by Mr. Trump in the Rose Garden for its accomplishment . And we all remember Senator McCain casting the deciding vote that sent this legislation to its grave , with Mr. Trump then criticizing McCain 's vote as `` treasonous . '' Contrary to Mr. Trump 's dishonesty , the American Health Care Act did not save pre-existing conditions . What it did was prohibit insurers from excluding consumers with pre-existing conditions but then allowed insurers to charge these high-risk consumers premiums at such a high cost that it would effectively deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions . Then after legislation eliminating the individual mandate passed , several G.O.P.-led states filed suit claiming the effect of that legislation rendered the A.C.A. unconstitutional . The Obama administration opposed those claims . After the Trump administration took office , his administration ceased opposing the states ' claims , and ultimately filed a brief before the Supreme Court actually agreeing that the A.C.A. should be found unconstitutional . If the states and the Trump administration are successful , coverage provided under the A.C.A. will end and tens of millions of Americans will lose health care coverage , including those with pre-existing conditions , as well as children who are covered under their parents ' insurance until they are 26 . And , the G.O.P. has no plan B ! Some savior ! Let us also not forget that our so-called congressman , Lee Zeldin , fought for passage of the A.H.C.A. -LRB- which in the version passed by the House also threatened to deny coverage to veterans who sought treatment from V.A. hospitals -RRB- . Mr. Trump 's dishonesty and Mr. Zeldin 's failure to fight for the needs of his constituency disqualify them from representing us . I hope you will join me and support Perry Gershon as our next congressman . He is already on record that he will try to save our health care protection . Sincerely , BRUCE COLBATH Washes Up East Hampton January 13 , 2020 On Jan. 5 Lee Zeldin tweeted , `` So ridiculous . Apparently this is from a new county law here in Suffolk . '' The tweet was accompanied by a photo of a sign in a Dunkin' Donuts that read , `` We can no longer offer you straws or put them out for you to help yourself ... you must ask us for a straw . '' So this is news to Mr. Zeldin , and he thinks it 's ridiculous ? Legislation banning plastic straws that has been talked and written about since the beginning of last year and signed into law on Earth Day , April 22 , is news to him ? That this legislation had the support of many restaurants is probably also news to him . Wake up , Mr. Zeldin . We live on an island . Anyone who has taken an early morning walk on the beach can tell you the amount of plastic that washes up is disturbing . We deserve a representative who is not only aware of what is going on in this district , but who is willing to step up and support solutions to the urgent environmental issues of the day . We can do better than a climate change denier whose contributions are a cavalier attitude and snarky tweets . Sincerely , CAROL DEISTLER A Selfie East Hampton Trump stands beside her , the Statue of Liberty , his hand up her dress . BERNIE GOLDHIRSCH About Wealth East Hampton January 9 , 2020 To fully understand our relationship with Iran we need a proper context . Iran compared to the U.S. is a minuscule , powerless country with few resources , a pathetic military , and very little wealth . That Iran would consider going to war with the U.S. is substantially imbecilic . They are not imbeciles . America 's context is really quite simple . Being white , Christian , and wealthy are all that matters . Virtually everything we do is about wealth ; 95 percent of our actions have to do with wealth . The other 5 percent are random . We are an uncomplicated , narrow-minded people . Ask almost anyone in the world . The problem with Iran is that its only real source of wealth is its oil . Unfortunately , we are awash in oil , and no longer need what Iran and the Middle East have to offer . If Iran fell off the earth tomorrow we would n't know it was gone . Yet we are doing all this crap with Iran as if it were 75 or 50 years ago , as a reflex -- something we think we are supposed to do and are n't really sure why . All this absurd energy and rhetoric and chaos and lies and distortions for no real reason . Granted Iranians are kind of dark - skinned , not Christians , and pretty poor , making them an easy ideological target , but why bother ? It appears that we have lost our mojo . Our manliness . Our sense of proportion . We are wasting out time and we are made for better , more lucrative things . We 've never had a pure capitalistic pig as a leader before . Maybe he 's leading us astray ? We 've never had someone with no conscience and no concern for human beings before . Have we found our true messiah ? He represents whiteness , religious depravity , and greed . Thank God , we have n't impeached him yet . NEIL HAUSIG Seven Principles Plainview January 9 , 2020 To The Star : Haters -LRB- and hypocrites -RRB- come in all colors -LRB- and religions -RRB- , but I wonder what percentage of the recent anti-Semitic hate-filled attackers of Jews have been simultaneously -LRB- and hypocritically -RRB- celebrating Kwanzaa during the last week of December , given that its seven principles include unity , responsibility , cooperation , purpose , and faith ? To them , I say , if you have a conscience , please feel some shame for your despicable assaults on decent people minding their own business , and try to begin following your own religion 's precepts , including Kwanzaa 's `` self-determination '' -LRB- to make yourself a decent person in 2020 -RRB- . And please re-read the list of Kwanzaa 's seven principles to convince yourself that anti-Semitism is not one of them ! RICHARD SIEGELMAN Locust Magnitude New York City January 10 , 2020 Cutting off the nose to spite the face , a needlessly self-destructive reaction . Hate is blinding -- two idioms currently acted played out relentlessly by the Democratic posse led by Nancy Pelosi , Adam Schiff , Chuck Schumer , and Jerry Nadler chasing , hunting the Trump , Biden , and Ukraine conspiracy machination , unfazed , undaunted by the pending of numerous crucial government initiatives and programs . In normal times and circumstances no creditable institution , sane political party , would even consider interviewing a candidate with Joe Biden 's liable susceptible baggage , aging health , and questionable state of mind . Yet there he is , and here we are . Should Biden win the nomination , and the odds are very favorable , prepare for locust-magnitude landings of accusations assertions revelations of his and family 's . Overwhelming , paralyzing fast east to the Ukraine , an assured dash to computer data storage units by anxious , fervent , salivating gangs sensing , smelling rich , lucrative blackmailing possibilities , prospects . Come on , Democrats , wise up ! The president is doing you a favor cleansing your swamp . Appreciate a big favor . EDWARD A.

As an example , you can use Synchronize ! Pro X to backup your OS X startup disk to another hard disk , so that the backup disk is bootable . Update your backup with `` Fast scan '' enabled , and it will be done 10x faster ! Or you can sync your home folder with a file server , or your PowerBook , or a FireWire disk , so that the files on both are up-to-date . Synchronize ! Pro X is specifically engineered for OS X , taking advantage of the modern properties of the operating system , such as pre-emptive multitasking , and supporting the full capabilities of the file system , including 255-character Unicode file names and OS X file permissions . Files are copied at the maximum speed possible , using pre-emptive multitasking to full advantage . It makes bootable backups of OS X system disks , without logging in as ` root ' . `` Fast scan '' makes updating a bootable backup incredibly quick , and real-time folder watching starts backups when files are changed . Old files can be archived rather than deleted . The status of backups can be monitored and accessed from any Web browser and email can be sent when backups happen , do n't happen or have errors . Synchronize ! Pro X actions can be scheduled to be performed at night or at any preset time , once or periodically , without anyone present . Passwords can be supplied automatically for file server connections . What 's new in Synchronize Pro X Version 6.9 : Removed the requirement for connection to the Qdea server to register a serial number . Join over 500,000 subscribers . Subscribe for our newsletter with best Mac offers from MacUpdate . Synchronize Pro X Screenshots I 'm worried that Qdea has abandoned SyncPro . The last update was in December 2017 , and I 'm already getting macOS warnings that the program is not up-to-date . I 've had to switch to SuperDuper for making bootable backups , and I feel like it wo n't be long before I have to switch to a new program for my file backups . Thoughts ? Like -LRB- 1 -RRB- Version 6.8.5 The site says `` The online store is no longer available '' . This app is soon going `` no-ware '' ... :-D Like -LRB- 1 -RRB- Version 6.8.5 I 'm worried that Qdea has abandoned SyncPro . The last update was in December 2017 , and I 'm already getting macOS warnings that the program is not up-to-date . I 've had to switch to SuperDuper for making bootable backups , and I feel like it wo n't be long before I have to switch to a new program for my file backups . Thoughts ? Like -LRB- 1 -RRB- Version 6.8.5 4 answer -LRB- s -RRB- Get the price down . Like -LRB- 2 -RRB- Version 6.8.4 I 've been using Synchronize Pro and Synchronize Plus now for maybe close to 10 years . The Developer has always been supportive via email . It works well for me -LRB- I use Carbon Copy but it does n't two `` two-way '' synchronization -RRB- and it a tool in my Mac bag that I ca n't do without . I appreciate the updates and will pay for good equipment or apps or software . Thank you . Patrick Like Version 6.8.2 My turn to put my two cents here . ;--RRB- I wrote a few years ago that SyncPro was the best , it surely was an excessive statement . I must say it 's just that I was used to it . Certainly it 's not for its `` gorgeous '' GUI ;--RRB- but at least it 's clear . Chronosync is its best competitor for half the price and it 's perfect for simple syncing , but gets very complicated when you try and set up things precisely -- at least , it 's not obvious to me . ;--RRB- What I appreciate in SyncPro is the sync documents . Some might say that Chronosync has them too and I suppose that when you get used to its settings , it 's ok . -LRB- What I like in Chronosync is the documents manager that allow to run multiple syncs in a row -RRB- One great thing about SyncPro is its wide compatibility : Intel/PPC since OS X 10.4 ! -LRB- that 's why I still use it on my old machines -- I do n't have the latest version , though ;--RRB- -RRB- I only know of iBackup that can run in so many OSes , but it has a different approach . We all agree that Sync Pro is overpriced and they probably rely on their existing user base , hence their price policy . ;--RRB- It 's quite obvious that any potential new user will run for Chronosync instead , if they need complex syncing , or choose a free alternative such as backupList + , FolderWatch or else for simple tasks . Like -LRB- 1 -RRB- Version 6.8 2 answer -LRB- s -RRB- While I am sure that the developer has invested a lot of thought , time and energy into writing this app , similar to other commenters here , I must concur that $ 100 for a backup utility , and then another $ 50.00 or so every two years is outrageously expensive . By comparison , consider this ... I have been using Carbon Copy Cloner -- which also makes very good bootable backups -- since at least November of 2010 . At that same time , I made a donation to Bombich Software of $ 15.00 . In December of 2012 I received a registration code for CCC 3.x I believe . As I recall , this was a free registration code , because I had previously donated to Bombich Software when CCC was still donationware . In October of 2014 I paid $ 20.00 to upgrade to CCC 4.x . In short , in just under five years , I have spent $ 35.00 for Carbon Copy Cloner , and I will probably spend another $ 20 when CCC 5.x comes out . No matter how you look at it , CCC has saved me loads of money , compared to what the Synchronize ! Pro X developers are asking for . Now , obviously , I ca n't compare feature for feature between these two apps , but I will say that CCC has been rock solid over the years , and it allows me to be very selective about my scheduled backups . I can back up an entire hard drive -- which will be bootable -- I can backup just certain folders and files , I can protect certain files and folders on the destination drive so that they are n't written over the next time that CCC performs an automated backup , I can schedule multiple backups at different hours of the day , and different days of the week , etc. . It 's great . It gives me peace of mind . Perhaps Synchronize ! Pro X can do all of this too . However , even if that is the case , why pay more than I really have to ? Oh , and did I mention that Bombich support is quite good ? I have had a number of email exchanges with them over the years . They see their customers as people , and not just as a source of revenue to milk . Enough said . Like -LRB- 3 -RRB- Version 6.8 1 answer -LRB- s -RRB- Too expensive for simple sync Like -LRB- 2 -RRB- Version 6.8 Another os x upgrade to Yosemite , so another `` upgrade '' to good old Sync Pro , lol . So glad I stopped shelling out $ 50 for this every 2 years after the initial $ 99 cost . Like Version 6.7 Unlike others I do n't begrudge the price or upgrade policy per se . But I do expect premium level support in return for premium level pricing . Qdea badly fails : the product fails to work in my environment according to vendor claims that it should . A dump indicated an OSX module failed that SynX invoked . . The developer declined to provide * any * assistance . Rationale : `` not his code '' and he had not encountered the problem before . Astoundingly , he did n't even ask if the problem was reproducible or survived a reboot . Tough to imagine a more unhelpful or arrogant response . As others mention , there are comparable products with considerably better support and lower prices . Recommend that they be considered - not Qdea 's . Like -LRB- 2 -RRB- Version 6.6 I used Synchronize Pro for years , paid the money and it was ok . At the time , the dev asked for a renewal fee to give support because of a problem I had with the software -LRB- yes : no fee = no further support -RRB- , I decided to find an alternative and to change . The solution was Cronosync . CS delivers the same functionality as SPro -LRB- or even more -RRB- , has far better server grade functions via CS Agents . In the end , it was a huge step forward . And the pricing was far better : 5 License Pack for 160 $ , 2 Agents for 20 $ and I was done . Including free Upgrades forever ! Thats the real deal . SPro was excellent in the 90s , but you will get the same 90s interface at the 90s pricing . The is an obsolete strategy , and it does n't deserve to be supported . This software should move to the Appstore at 2.95 $ , and it might be a success again . Chronosync is not in the Appstore , which is a customer benefit in terms of better pricing . Far better pricing . Like -LRB- 3 -RRB- Version 6.6 1 answer -LRB- s -RRB- Soundsgoodtome 11 September 2014 I could n't agree more . Years ago , a friend introduced me to SPX , and I paid for it happily . But Qdea 's update policy frankly stinks . Now , does the software complete its tasks with many variations and options ? Absolutely . But those defending the upgrade policy keep stating things like : \u2022 `` The version that you bought works forever . '' Sure , but that 's only if you never update your OS . So , if you 're the type who 's still running Tiger or whatever and tends to ignore OS updates , then this product 's update policy is for you . They also say : \u2022 `` You only have to update every 2 years -- and that 's only * if * you want to use a version that was released more than two years after the last license you bought . '' You people make it sound like updating one 's OS is some rare thing that only the geekiest of geeks do . There are legit reasons for updating one 's OS . And yes , when the OS gets updated , often a number of apps must also be updated . And trust me : I have TONS of software . But no other company whose software I own expects you to shell out a full $ 50 every 2 years . And let 's talk about the other white elephant in the room : When Qdea updates SPX , what do you get ? A couple of under-the-hood fixes that are important for OS compatibility . But the interface has n't been updated since World War 1 . -LRB- OK , that was an exaggeration . lol . -RRB- But seriously -- other developers do COMPLETE REVAMPS of the look and feel of their apps -- and charge only $ 10 or $ 15 for these annual or bi-annual updates . Qdea changes absolutely NOTHING in the interface , and often adds not even one , new feature thats actually visible -- yet they want $ 50 . Ever heard of `` form and function , '' Qdea ? Like it or not , BOTH are important . The degree to which one is more important will vary from customer to customer . And yes , of course it 's critical for software to do its job and do it well . But there 's also something to be said for keeping up with the times in terms of an app 's design . It 's simply NOT enough for an app to merely perform well . Like it or not , it also needs to LOOK GOOD . Well , SPX has frankly * never * looked good . But it did its job well , and that was ok -- 10 or more years ago . But if you 're going to ask people to fork out money , every couple of years -LRB- and please -- spare me the `` but you do n't HAVE to upgrade '' speech -RRB- , the least you could do is give the thing a facelift to help justify the additional fees . And if you are n't skilled with UI -LRB- which clearly is the case , here -RRB- , bite the bullet and HIRE someone who is , which is what many developers do . They hire amazingly talented designers -- sometimes even on another continent -- to give their apps polish and style . I realize SPX falls into the category of `` utilitarian '' applications , but that 's no excuse for it not to look halfway decent * as well * as doing its job . I made these very comments -LRB- though less sharply -RRB- to Qdea , years ago , and they 've gone ignored . At a certain point , you realize that people are who they are . And the folks at Qdea make software that performs very well ! But they do n't give a rat 's ass about how the app looks . And that 's a mistake . I 'm at a point where I need to upgrade , but I refuse to fork over another penny for the same , ancient interface . Instead , I 'm going to spend that money on a competing app that does its job * and * looks decent . Qdea , if you ever read this , take a look at apps like CleanMyMac 2 , which is also utilitarian , but whose interface is absolutely STUNNING . -LRB- I 'm unaffiliated . -RRB- Heck -- even Carbon Copy Cloner -LRB- another utilitarian app -RRB- has a nice design without being `` over the top . '' Those developers do release updates for OS compatibility , but they also periodically refresh the UI , which -- like it or not -- is additional incentive for customers to update . Perhaps someday you 'll realize this . But for those of us who are now jumping ship , you 're unfortunately too late .", "url": "https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/6897/synchronize-pro-x", "kws": ["multiple^^syncs", "real-time^^folder", "complex^^syncing", "file^^server^^connections", "multiple^^backups", "bootable^^backups", "files", "OS^^updates", "apps", "feature", "OS^^compatibility", "best^^Mac", "free^^Upgrades", "release^^updates", "Passwords", "pre-emptive^^multitasking", "customer", "comparable^^products", "customers", "premium^^level^^support"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"TechnologyElectronics": 0.9993553757667542}, "second_cat": {"TechnologyElectronics_Computers": 0.9993553757667542}}}

Organizations like the CIA and NSA like to remain in the background -- it 's how they catch spies and terrorists . But when a security flaw is dangerous enough , the equation changes . For example , the NSA previously spoke out about an urgent Windows update that stopped BlueKeep , a dangerous security exploit that could let hackers take over computers worldwide . Tap or click to find out how bad this bug really was . And now , a new bug has prompted the NSA to urge Windows users to update immediately . This patch fixes a critical flaw that affects 900 million devices . If unaddressed , your computer can be duped into thinking viruses are ordinary files . Unfortunately , the update did n't roll out as smoothly as expected . But in true Microsoft fashion , the fix has a fix of its own . Here 's how you can safely update your PC . Update your Windows 10 system immediately ! This week , Microsoft released a patch for a critical windows vulnerability with help from none other than the NSA . The announcement on the organization 's webpage explains the NSA discovered a dangerous flaw in Windows 10 that allows malware to masquerade as ordinary software . Hackers can take advantage of the flaw , thanks to an issue with a part of Windows called CryptoAPI . This system component checks apps and programs for `` developer signatures '' that prove they come from trusted sources . By exploiting the flaw , a hacker could spoof a piece of malware to make it look like a normal program . This would allow them to quietly and dangerously infect computers without users ever being aware something is wrong . This fix was quietly shipped to users as part of Microsoft 's routine patching program , and is also available as a standard download via Windows Update . Unlike others before , this patch is the first in history to be credited to the NSA by Microsoft . A real-life spy organization is helping us make our computers safer . Fixing the fix Unfortunately , like several of Microsoft 's other fixes , the rollout did n't quite go as planned . Upon downloading , users would be greeted by a variety of system errors , some of which include the following : `` We could not complete the install because an update service was shutting down '' `` There were problems installing some updates , but we 'll try again later . 2020-01 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1909 for x64-based Systems -LRB- KB4528760 -RRB- -- Error 0x800f0988 . Troubleshooter , sfc , dism do n't fix error . '' Thankfully , the issue is contained to Microsoft 's internal update process . This means users can still get the patch , but many will have to download it and install manually . While it 's good there 's a workaround for this issue , it 's unfortunate that many of the world 's less tech-inclined users will miss out on a critical patch to protect their system until Microsoft straightens the bugs out . How do I download this update from Microsoft ? Although the initial patch has some issues installing , it 's still worth attempting to install the traditional way . The majority of users experiencing issues are running Windows 10 builds 1903 and 1909 , but others have seen success with their installs . For those of you at homes attempting to install the patch , try the method below first before moving to a manual install . For the normal method , you can update your system by navigating to Settings and clicking Update & Security . In this menu , you can click Check for updates to see the latest patches available . Once the window populates with the latest patch , you can download it to install . Check the following numbers to make sure you have the correct patch : KB4534306 base update KB4534271 for Windows 10 Version 1607 KB4534276 for Windows 10 Version 1709 KB4534293 for Windows 10 Version 1803 KB4534273 for Windows 10 Version 1809 KB4528760 for Windows 10 Version 1903 and 1909 If you have issues installing , you 're likely running the versions we mentioned above -LRB- 1903 and 1909 -RRB- . You 'll need to manually download the patch listed above for those versions from Microsoft 's website . To install manually , tap or click here to visit the Microsoft Update Catalog . Then , enter KB4528760 into the search bar . Next , click Download next to the update version that 's compatible with your PC . If you 're not sure which version you 're on , right-click the windows icon at the bottom left of the start menu bar and select Settings , followed by System , then About . Staying safe in the digital world Microsoft makes it relatively easy to get your system up to date . Once the patch is installed , you should be fine , though we still advise you to exercise caution when downloading or exploring files you are n't familiar with . With security holes as big as this one , hackers are always on the move . If you want to skip the hassle of always checking for updates , make sure to turn on automatic updates in this same section . Enabling this feature will keep your OS current , and will minimize the chances of you missing a critical update and getting hit with a hack . But do keep in mind : Just because you 're protected from one security flaw does n't mean you 're protected from others . Be skeptical , be cautious and always use your best judgement when exploring the web .

0.0	{"docid": "0NsT4NZf", "title": "I Flew the Same Route as the 1920s Airmail Pilots , and Lived to Tell the Tale", "content": "I 'm standing in Parking Lot 5 of the Scott Campus of the University of Nebraska Omaha . It 's a cold , gray evening , with low ceilings and spitting rain . I look around at the towering buildings on all sides , and it 's hard to imagine that this was once the site of an airfield . If I had been flying the Omaha-to-Cheyenne route back in the glory days of airmail , this would have been my starting point . Now you need a permit to park your car here . All that 's left to show that an airport once existed is a forlorn metal plaque erected by the Nebraska State Historical Society . It faces a busy street . In the morning I 'll use modern GPS to arrive in the air above this very spot , but after that , I 'm going to attempt to re-fly a third of the transcontinental airmail route using nothing but a set of written instructions that are now nearly 100 years old . Before aeronautical charts , before the concrete arrows and the flashing airway beacons , before radios , the U.S. Post Office Department was bootstrapping its fledgling airmail experiment into a full-blown , regularly scheduled , coast-to-coast venture , and it needed a means for new pilots to find their way . The solution ? A contest among airmail pilots for the best-written description of each leg of the route . The collection was bound together into a slim volume called Pilots ' Directions . Published by the post office in early 1921 , Pilots ' Directions is a field guide to contact flying the transcontinental route , leapfrogging from landmark to landmark , staying `` in contact '' with the terrain . Being a multi-author work , it does n't read with a single voice , nor , having been written at a time when cross country flying was still in its infancy , does it give unified advice : Some pilot authors suggested using railroads as landmarks ; others , the descriptions of towns . Others still give advice relying upon lakes and rivers . Starting in New York , the route crossed the Alleghenies , slid under the Great Lakes , ventured out across the Great Plains , spanned the Wyoming Rockies and the mighty Wasatch Range guarding the Salt Lake Valley , and traversed the rugged landscape of the far West before finally vaulting the Sierra Nevada to end on the far side of the nation in San Francisco . Flipping through the book 's faded pages , I wondered if Pilots ' Directions could still be used to navigate the 2,640-mile route in today 's world . As the 100th anniversary of the book closed in , I decided to abandon a century of aviation progress and find out . All I needed was an airmail airplane . It 's a funny thing . People who own antique biplanes are n't too keen about loaning them out to strangers . Truth be told , I did n't waste time trying to snag the use of a Liberty-powered de Havilland DH-4 , the sweetheart of the early mail , because the perfect airplane for the job was in the hangar next to mine : An Army brown 1946 Ercoupe with bright yellow wings , Warbler . Now before you cry foul , consider the following : The ' Coupe has pretty much the same speed as the early mailplanes , and by sliding its doors down into its belly , I can transform it into an open-cockpit airplane . All it 's missing is an extra set of wings . Or maybe not . Thanks to the DH 's weak and collapse-prone landing gear , lower wing damage was a common occurrence , and even with warehouses chock full of war surplus parts , the `` mechanicians '' of the airmail service quickly ran out of lower wings . In his book Tracks Across the Sky : The Story of the Pioneers of the U.S. Air Mail , Page Shamburger observed that virtually every Postal Department DH-4 ended up flying solely on its top wings . Plus , this particular ' Coupe has exactly the same instruments the mailplanes had : rudimentary engine gauges , an airspeed indicator , an altimeter , a compass , and ... well , that 's about it . To get Warbler fully airmail worthy , I sent some pictures of early airmail airplanes to Victory Girl -- a custom jacket-painting and airplane nose art business -- who made me some special vinyl markings to dress Warbler for the part : bold text that simply reads , `` U.S. MAIL . '' To complete the transformation , I taped a half-empty bottle of bourbon to the instrument panel to serve as an attitude indicator -- just like the airmail pilots did . Of course , it does n't work . The airmail pilots knew that too . But their ground-pounder bosses did n't , and this was during Prohibition , after all . Now that Warbler looked the part , I felt that I needed to look the part too . I found a knee-length brown leather button-up jacket of the style World War I pilots wore . Then I dug out my longest winter scarf . It 's gray , not white , but it would do . Finally , I went online and bought a leather flying helmet . And goggles . I was dressed for success . But would I succeed ? No one I knew was willing to bet on it . Now I 'm 1,000 feet up , attempting to channel my inner airmail pilot . Who will he be ? Will he be the courageous `` Wild Bill '' Hopson , famous for his uncanny ability to find his way through any weather ? Or will he be the hapless George Boyle , who was shown the door after getting lost on both of his first two airmail flights ? I twist my wrist to check the time on my Hamilton watch -- 09:27 -- then I jot the time down in pencil on a scrap of cardboard . The Hamilton company gave all the early airmail pilots free watches to help guide them along their routes . They did n't give me one , but they were kind enough to lend me one for my flight , and I 'm getting a big kick out of sharing this link with the past . I 'm also coming to appreciate the importance of time in contact flying . My loaner watch is saying I 'm 20 minutes out from my simulated takeoff at the long-buried Omaha airmail field . I should be at Wahoo , which , according to Directions is a `` fair-sized town three miles south of the course . '' It adds , `` Six railroads radiate from Wahoo . '' Ahead , and much closer than three miles from my course , is a town . But is it Wahoo ? In the past 100 years , fair-sized towns have become cities , and new fair-sized towns have sprung up where none existed before . Every cluster of houses that passes under my wings triggers a flurry of confusion and doubt . Could that be Loup City ? I should n't be there for five more minutes . Has the wind let up ? Or am I off course ? Damn , there should n't be a town here ! I divert south , coming in over the edge of town , anxious to find the six railroads , or at least evidence they once existed . I 'm finding living railroads hard to spot in a landscape crisscrossed with roads and highways of every size , and dead railroads are even trickier . Most have vanished without a trace . Peering over the wing , I see only two rail lines below . My heart sinks . Either I 'm already Boyle-lost , or the world has changed so much in the last century that Pilots ' Directions is nothing more than a fascinating footnote in the dusty bin of aviation history . Then I see it : A 12-story water tower with 10-foot-tall letters spelling out WAHOO . `` Wha-hoo ! It 's Wahoo ! '' I shout , pumping my fist in victory . Boyle is buried . Hopson swells in my breast . Of course , this is cheating . Such convenient markers did n't exist in the days of Pilots ' Directions . It was common practice for communities to paint their names on the roofs of their largest buildings , but that practice was n't formalized until 1926 . Still , I rationalize using this modern intelligence by remembering tales I 've read about lost airmail pilots landing in farmer 's fields to ask directions , which I 've not had to do . Yet . Then the ground begins to speak to me . Showing me clues to keep me on course . Rotted posts rising from the mud in a stream . A dead bridge 's tombstone . A smooth grass-covered grade through the hillocks , the ghost of the Chicago , Burlington & Quincy Railroad . And right on schedule come David City ... Osceola ... St. Paul ... all when and where they should be . Now that I 've got the knack , contact flying is simple . Peaceful . Sailing along low to the ground , wind swirling through the open cockpit , I 'm in touch with the aviators of old . Back when flying was physical , tactile , exciting . Following Mason City , Pilots ' Directions informs me that , `` no distinguishing landmarks are available '' for the next 65 miles . It 's the most accurate description in the whole friggin ' book . I see only featureless prairie . Minutes tick by on my Hamilton . I fly west by compass , recalling Airmail Superintendent Benjamin B. Lipsner 's comment : `` We had only a few instruments to contend with , and of these , the compass was the most troublesome . '' My compass is better , but my directions were written by men using troublesome compasses . Tick-tock . Tick-tock . I fly over the endless prairie . The sun is behind my left shoulder so I know I 'm not radically off course , but at the same time my confidence in my archaic navigation skills is fading . At the designated time , my destination of North Platte fails to appear . Boyle is back . My insecurities roar up larger than monsters . I start doubting myself again . I consider my options . I 've arrived at all my other waypoints a hair ahead of schedule . Maybe the wind changed ? Or did I drift north and bypass the city ? I could n't have wandered south , as I 've not crossed the Platte River -- which is to the south of my course . Tick-tock . Tick-tock . Nothing but prairie . So I 'm either north ... or I 'm dead on course and I 've hit headwinds . How long should I wait ? And if I turn due south and fly until I hit the river , how will I know which way to turn to find the city and my much-needed refueling stop ? Tick-tock . Tick-tock . Damn you , Boyle . Then , over a slight rise to the south , about seven miles away , are buildings . I bank left and point Warbler 's nose at the center of the rapidly growing signs of civilization . And there , on the east bank of the north branch of the Platte River , right where it has been for a hundred years , is the airport . Hopson kicks Boyle 's butt out of the airplane . Then , winging over the field , I 'm instantly disappointed . I 'd seen historic photos of the U.S. Airmail Station here : a classic art deco hangar with a graceful curved roof . In my mind 's eye , I believed it still existed out here in the middle of the Nebraska prairie , a time capsule . But once again , I find that nothing much remains of the airmail service 's past . The airport is grotesquely modern . Still , I have mail to deliver . And like my wayfinding methods , my mail is old fashioned . Paper envelopes with stamps on them . Of course , unlike the early airmail pilots , I find no ground crew awaiting me in a truck with the engine running , ready to pull the mail bags from my airplane the second my prop stops spinning . Instead , I find a mailbox in front of the terminal building , and slide my envelopes through the narrow slot . Inside the terminal , however , I find a relic from the past on display : The actual flight jacket of Jack Knight , hero of the first night mail . It looks like the one I 'm wearing , only faded , old , and brittle . The 100-year-old jacket is torn in several places , but lovingly mended with leather laces , stitched in the style of surgical sutures . It 's a reminder that flying the mail in the early days was dangerous work , the service averaging nearly one fatality per month . The following day , freezing air slashes into my leather jacket with icy claws , pierces my gloves , seems to whisk away the fabric of my canvas pants , and swirls into my shoes . Things were better yesterday . The good book sayeth : `` Almost directly west will be seen black irregular peaks in the Laramie Mountains . Fly over the mountains just to the north of these peaks . '' Ahead , the entire horizon , from south to north , is nothing but black irregular peaks . I read the paragraph again . Then I stick my head out of the airplane , into the slipstream . There 's no need ; it just seems like something a real airmail pilot would do in a situation like this . The blast of frigid air pushes my goggles into my face and tugs at the edges of my Perrone leather flying helmet , but it does n't help me figure out which peak I 'm supposed to fly north of . Boyle is back . Again . The book tells me to look for sheep , or rather , a small flat-topped mountain range that , `` resembles a huddled-up bunch of sheep . '' I see no sheep . Huddled or not . Am I even in the right place ? Surely a mere 100 years can not have changed the look of the mountains ? But the jagged , snow-encrusted peak to my right is n't mentioned in Pilots ' Directions . And where the hell are the sheep ? Unless I 'm reading the book or the landscape incorrectly , I 'm at the gateway to my crossing of the Medicine Bow Range . Pilots ' Directions tells me there are numerous landing fields on the other side of the ridge that can be reached from 8,000 feet . I took this to mean I must ascend to above 8,000 feet to clear the ridge , but now I 'm not sure . Warbler has clawed its way up to 9,500 feet , and with the drag from its open canopy , will go no higher . But the ridge looks higher yet . With nothing visible behind , I ca n't be sure if I 'm above or below the crest . Still , this has to be it . Summoning my inner Hopson , I steel myself and turn into the heart of the Rocky Mountains . Below , pine trees cover the shoulder of the mountain like a tightly woven blanket . There 's nowhere to put down . Are the trees getting closer ? The ragged mountain peak off my right wing blots out the northern horizon . Yes , the blanket of trees is closer now . Warbler 's engine drones steadily . I scan the meager instrument panel : Oil pressure good . Temp good . Altitude steady . The bourbon in the bottle taped to the panel is tranquil , not to say inviting . Those trees are really close now . How close to the treetops did my guide fly his DH-4 to clear the ridge ? Or am I in the wrong place ? Suddenly , I find my inner airmail pilot . He 's not Hopson . Not Boyle . He 's Maurice Newton , the bifocaled elder of the pilot group who famously became `` yellow '' following a nasty crash . I execute a shallow turn and slide back down off the shoulder of the Medicine Bow Range , the blanket of trees dropping away beneath me as I abandon my attempt to cross . Course reversed , I break out my portable GPS to find my way across the range , my inner Hopson muttering about `` Yellah '' pilots under his breath . I divert to Rawlins for fuel using this modern high tech , sulking the whole way about my failure to do as well on the second day as I had done on the first . But once gassed up , I 'm back on the case , using Pilots ' Directions to get to Rock Springs -- having trouble finding `` a huge black hill of rock south of the course , '' called , appropriately enough , Black Butte . Next stop : Salt Lake City . To find the airmail field , Pilots ' Directions says , `` Follow westward along the road just south of the fair grounds . '' The fair grounds are still there . As is the airfield . But it 's now among the biggest airports in the country . So what has remained the same since the days of Pilots ' Directions ? Almost nothing . What has changed ? Nearly everything . What disappeared ? Nearly every trace of the airmail pioneers . And yet , I 've proven that the world of a century earlier has not been overgrown or overbuilt so completely that this once-invaluable reference guide ca n't still be useful . Despite a brief GPS detour , I returned to its pages , flying through the mountains using its century-old prose , my wits , a watch , and a pencil -- and relishing my hard-won connection to a long-dead era . I throttle back , descending from my high perch in the sky above the mountains that ring the city . Their sheer , rocky faces fall so abruptly to the valley floor that I feel like I 'm diving into a pool of deep , clear water -- and suddenly the modern world blasts the last vestiges of the past out of my cockpit . A barrage of radio chatter floods into my headset . My thumb rests on the transmit button , but there 's no break in the deluge of calls , instructions , and directions to let me announce my presence . It 's such a shock from how I 've been flying that my inner Yellow Maurice is in his full glory . Although I 've arranged permission to land the rudimentary Warbler with gigantic , instrumented airliners , I tuck my twin-tails between my legs and turn Warbler south to flee . But then my backbone returns . Neither missing airports nor lost train tracks nor tall mountains nor scary-busy airspace shall stay this self-appointed courier from the swift completion of his appointed rounds . I land and deliver my last batch of mail . Hopson would be proud .", "url": "https://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/omaha-salt-lake-city-without-gps-180973967/", "kws": ["1920s^^Airmail", "lost^^airmail^^pilots", "flying", "antique^^biplanes", "tall^^mountains", "numerous^^landing^^fields", "lost^^train^^tracks", "landmarks", "Altitude", "tales", "scary-busy^^airspace", "dead^^railroads", "living^^railroads", "glory^^days", "rock^^south", "modern^^GPS", "aviation^^history", "point^^Warbler", "historic^^photos", "Rock^^Springs"], "text_category": {}}

Here are the 30 best new movies at Redbox : 30 . Yesterday Year : 2019 Director : Danny Boyle A struggling musician named Jack -LRB- Himesh Patel -RRB- , still barely hanging onto his passion in life thanks to the unwavering support and encouragement from his best friend/manager Ellie -LRB- Lily James -RRB- , gets hit by a bus and is knocked out on the night when all power mysteriously gets cut off across the globe for a minute . He wakes up in the hospital to a new reality where The Beatles never existed , and he 's the only one on the planet who remembers their songs . By introducing the world to John , Paul , George and sometimes Ringo 's genius , he becomes an overnight sensation as the greatest songwriter of all time . Thus is Yesterday 's high-concept comedy/musical premise . But it 's also a testament to how not only The Beatles , but great art in general , enriches the human soul and makes us grateful to be alive . While many might assume the introduction of The Beatles ' greatest work into a virgin universe would result in widespread acceptance , writer Richard Curtis and director Danny Boyle have a lot of fun with how the modern world would react to the songs and would tweak them to fit the times . The film is chock full of astute humor about , say , who the hell Sergeant Pepper is or how `` Hey Dude '' makes more sense than `` Hey Jude . '' -LRB- Thankfully , the `` I used to beat my girlfriend '' lyric from `` Getting Better '' is n't mentioned . -RRB- While Curtis ' attention to character keeps us emotionally engaged , Boyle 's manic editing and quirky visual choices , such as names of locations floating around the frame , propels the story forward like a well-oiled narrative machine . With her effortless charisma and magnetism , Lily James proves herself to be a formidable rom-com star . Himesh Patel certainly fits Curtis ' archetype of melancholic and self-deprecating male protagonists , but also leaves a strong impression with his beautiful singing voice and stage presence . If it accomplishes nothing else , Yesterday lets us relive the grandiosity of The Beatles as if it 's our first time . A fab accomplishment indeed . -- Oktay Ege Kozak / Full Review 29 . How to Train Your Dragon : The Hidden World Year : 2019 Director : Dean DeBlois While every studio is tripping over themselves to kick-start the next blockbuster franchise before the first film is even cast , the How to Train Your Dragon crew has been building an engaging family fantasy/adventure trilogy -LRB- loosely based on the novels of Cressida Cowell -RRB- over the last ten years . The first movie was a pleasant surprise -- it not only avoided Dreamworks ' then-prevalent animated family fare formula of tongue-in-cheek humor and pop-culture references , but built on its source material in a way that created a distinct fantasy world that any fan of the genre , child or adult , could enjoy . At its core , the story of Viking teen Hiccup -LRB- Jay Baruchel -RRB- befriending a rare dragon called Toothless and learning to get along with dragons in a culture that feared and hunted them was a tender allegory on young adults paving their own way in life while standing up to tradition they deem to be wrongheaded . How to Train Your Dragon : The Hidden World revolves around Hiccup trying to find a new location that would keep the people of Berk and their dragons safe . After spending years rescuing dragons from captivity , the townspeople are understandably worried that the dragon poachers will soon retaliate , so Hiccup takes it upon himself to find the mythical Hidden World where humans and dragons can live in peace . Meanwhile , Toothless falls in love with a female night fury -LRB- dubbed a `` light fury '' thanks to her bright white skin -RRB- . The new love interest is joined by a new antagonist , Grimmel -LRB- F. Murray Abraham -RRB- , the greatest dragon hunter in the world . The developing rift -- or perhaps it 's more precise to call it `` drift '' -- between Hiccup and Toothless that provides the overall narrative glue for the film 's series of breathtaking action set pieces might provide a bittersweet tone for fans of the series . Yet it also captures the bittersweet experiences we all face when we take our final steps into adulthood . That does n't mean the spectacle is lacking . The visual majesty of this Viking utopia , full of foggy mountains and the clear blue sea as far as the eye can see get yet another upgrade with some new breathtaking locations . It all makes for a solid conclusion to such an endearing franchise . Given it success , it seems unlikely this will be the last film from the land of Berk and beyond . But as a closing chapter in the tale of Hiccup and Toothless , The Hidden World ends this portion of the tale on a satisfying note . -- Oktay Ege Kozak / Full Review 28 . Missing Link Year : 2019 Director : Chris Butler Since we learned that Bumbles bounce in 1964 , the legend of Bigfoot has provided a jumping-off point for countless kids ' movies . Warner gave us Smallfoot last year , and 2019 will deliver two more , DreamWorks ' Abominable and Laika 's Missing Link . What sets the Laika film apart , as usual , is the visual spectacle provided by the studio 's stop-motion animation . Fortunately , equal care went into the story as to the distinctive animation . The last Sasquatch teams up with failed explorer Sir Lionel Frost to find a new family among the Yeti of the Himalayas . Hugh Jackman as mythical-beast hunter and Zoe Saldana as his partner 's widow both grow in satisfying ways , and Zach Galifianakis provides equal parts comedy and charm as the well-read , mild-mannered beast . Still , it 's the meticulous craft of stop-motion scenes from Edwardian England to the frontier of the Wild West to the mountains of Nepal that will stick with you the longest . -- Josh Jackson 27 . Pok\u00e9mon Detective Pikachu Year : 2019 Director : Rob Letterman Starring Ryan Reynolds as a PG version of Deadpool and wide-eyed baby angel Justice Smith , Pok\u00e9mon Detective Pikachu tosses together the Pok\u00e9mon fanbase with lightly grizzled noir cinema , a coming-of-age story and a dash of family drama . While that may seem like a meal with too many ingredients , the result is rather filling . Tim Goodman -LRB- Smith -RRB- exists at that stage of early adulthood when friends slip away to different corners of the globe , and one 's direction in life must be decided . Tim contents himself with the life he 's built as a junior insurance adjustor . When he learns his policeman father has been killed in the line of duty , he travels to the literal urban jungle of Ryme City , where humans and Pok\u00e9mon live side by side in adorable harmony . Of course , his father 's death is n't cut and dry . Soon , with the help of his father 's Pok\u00e9mon partner , Pikachu , Tim becomes an investigator in his own right , navigating the not-so-mean streets of Ryme City and learning to dream bigger than he ever dared before . Visually the film builds on Pikachu 's love of noir by creating a neon noir world . Instead of relying on shadows and inky blacks to create mystery , cinematographer John Mathieson -LRB- Gladiator -RRB- uses the neon glow of city signs to banish nearly all shadows from the frame . Blacks create a nice contrast but only reach a complete lack of light in a car crash scene . Lighting the film 's darker moments with neon makes the transition to the sunnier , more family-focused moments a smooth one . And really : The cute factor of this film can not be overstated . This film is fantasy , and the results are magical . It completely skips the uncanny valley in favor of a wickedly fun , albeit unnatural look , capturing the spirit of its source material as effectively as a well-aimed Pok\u00e9 Ball . -- Joelle Monique / Full Review 26 . Shazam ! Year : 2019 Director : David F. Sandberg The best thing one can say about Shazam ! is that , following on the fins of the wonderfully extravagant and amazingly stupid Aquaman , the latest DC movie is one more sign to assure the proletariat that the imprint has permanently dislodged its head from the asshole of Zack Snyder 's Murderverse . While Wonder Woman mused that , hey , maybe a DC movie need not labor over traumatized backstories and hypermasculinized mommy issues , and Aquaman suggested that blockbuster movies can have things like `` color '' and `` humor , '' Shazam ! synthesizes those mommy issues into a positive treatise on family , doubling down on the jokes and bright primary shininess . The plot , by-the-numbers , floats somewhere between a Spielberg coming-of-age adventure , a Big reboot and a late - '80s horror comedy -- think The Monster Squad in that it 's intended for kids but is too old for its ostensible demographic . If only Shazam ! were as much a herald as its DCEU forebears , for better or ill , a sign of something new and exciting to come . It 's not . It is , despite its surprisingly gruesome violence , little more than another superhero movie that will make more money than the GDP of a small island nation . Leaning real hard into the jokes about horny teenage boys and meta-skewerings of superhero films , Shazam ! ca n't help but comment on its genre ad nauseam , though , unlike Deadpool , it never risks arguing against its own existence . It 's , more often than not , a very funny movie , and a superhero film with a budget under $ 100M is a -LRB- sigh -- sorry , Mom -RRB- refreshing development for the genre . Plus , a diverse cast is always welcome , even if headlined by Zachary Levi , who must realize how goddamn lucky he is to get the one remaining superhero role where it conceptually pays off to be a generically attractive white guy . -- Dom Sinacola / Full Review 25 . The Last Black Man in San Francisco Year : 2019 Director : Joe Talbot In Joe Talbot 's The Last Black Man in San Francisco , white people are the harbingers of annihilation . The film centers on Jimmie Fails -LRB- Jimmie Fails -RRB- , the proverbial Last Black Man who attempts to reclaim his family 's old home in San Francisco 's Fillmore neighborhood , once called `` The Harlem of the West , '' by trespassing on the property to do banal bits of upkeep : painting the trim , tending to the flowers . He tries desperately to keep and save the house . Outside , the zombies are well-meaning , old white people , hipster girls and disgusting tech bros invading the city . Opening with images of apocalypse -- a street preacher barking about repentance , and men in HazMat suits trying to clean up the pollution in the Bay -- The Last Black Man in San Francisco winks at gentrification as an extinction-level event -- for Black people in the city , at least . A shrewd inversion of racist tropes , we see the white owners yell at Fails to get off their property , knowing Fails is the real caretaker of the house , and the white residents are , even in their neoliberal good intentions , the villains , the invaders . -- Geoff Nelson 24 . Dragged Across Concrete Year : 2019 Director : S. Craig Zahler It 's more apt a title than most to describe the manner in which writer-director S. Craig Zahler pulls us from place to place over the course of a few days in the lives of old school cops Brett -LRB- Mel Gibson -RRB- and Anthony -LRB- Vince Vaughn -RRB- . We meet them in the few hushed minutes before they brutalize a suspect ; they seem much too self-aware and articulate to be as racist as one would assume , given their propensity for violence , and Zahler never quite justifies nor condemns their copious , morally questionable -LRB- and often despicable -RRB- actions . All in the name of supporting their families under the threat of losing their jobs , so they say ; Zahler gives fascinating , quick-witted lines and hilarious rapport and insightful mini-soliloquies to his two leads , so he obviously wants them to be remembered as tragic figures more than outright villains . Equally venomous and Victorian , offensive and outraged , Dragged Across Concrete is a potboiler in the purest sense , a wicked tale of two cops putting their skills to more lucrative use , a sad bit of pulp that describes our current economic despair as tonally on-point as the economic despair of any American decade since forever -- a movie about racist white cops starring Mel Gibson and his notable Hollywood conservative friend , Vince Vaughn . Were one to overlook Zahler 's obvious mastering of atmosphere and dread and bleakly compelling genre indulgence , one would find Problematic : The Movie , a measured provocation meant to make questionable choices in order to -- if we 're being charitable -- ultimately condemn these two men to the loser 's heap of history . Unlike the endings to Zahler 's previous films , Bone Tomahawk and the endlessly entertaining Brawl in Cell Block 99 , Dragged Across Concrete 's final half hour exhausts itself to an inevitable , somber conclusion . The right person has won , but only at the cost of great trauma in his wake . And as for Brett and Anthony , their defeat is swift , melacholic and , perhaps best of all , stupid : Zahler 's final refutation for the very beliefs he also seems , sometimes and unfortunately , to be all about . -- Dom Sinacola 23 . Captain Marvel Year : 2019 Directors : Anna Boden , Ryan Fleck It remains , when you think about it , absolutely insane that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has featured two new movies , one of which introduces an entirely new character , in between two halves of a nearly six-hour epic where half the cast dies in Part One . Talk about your flex moves ! One thing Captain Marvel has going for it that Ant Man and the Wasp did n't is that it gives us a lead character we can care about and -LRB- even more importantly -RRB- an actor who rises to the occasion . In many of these Marvel origin stories -- and by my count , this is the eighth one since the original Iron Man -- the movie goes through great pains to explain to us why we should care about this new character , why , with everything else we have to keep track of , we should readily agree to adding one more to the mix . Captain Marvel , like many MCU movies , sometimes labors under the weight of having to tell its own story while still connecting to the larger , ongoing saga , but it has no issues with justifying its main character : We see in her eyes , from the first second , what 's different about her . The movie has us on her side before she ever says a word . The key is Brie Larson , an instantly , almost subconsciously empathetic actress who finds a new , fascinating gear here as Vers who , when we first meet her , is a Kree warrior fighting in outer space with an elite force led by her trainer , Yon-Rogg -LRB- Jude Law -RRB- . Vers has no memory of her past , but it returns to her when , in the midst of a battle , she 's dumped onto a distant planet that turns out not only to be Earth , but also her home planet and in the year 1995 . She ends up , rather conveniently , running into future S.H.I.E.L.D. head Nick Fury -LRB- a digitally de-aged , and convincingly so , Samuel L. Jackson -RRB- and a series of Air Force pilots who provide clues to her past through a supersecret initiative called `` Pegasus . '' The film is otherwise entertaining and exhausting in the equal measures we have come to expect from modern Marvel movies -- if you 've seen one bad guy bent on galaxy domination , you 've seen them all . But this movie is n't about the supporting characters , or the setting , or even how well its big action set pieces play out . It 's all about whether or not they can sell this Captain Marvel as someone who even the mighty Avengers can call to someday help them save the world . -- Will Leitch / Full Review 22 . The Art of Self-Defense Year : 2019 Director : Riley Stearns Boys are n't supposed to enjoy being fussed over or decorated , and boys who do need to be corrected , the thinking goes . The Art of Self-Defense seems at first as if it 's just about how silly the axiomatic trappings of masculinity are . Then you realize that , no , it 's also about how scary they are , too . Casey -LRB- Jesse Eisenberg , in a role seemingly written to fit him like a glove -RRB- is a squirrely man who works a boring job and finds himself at the bottom of every social pissing order he encounters , be it French tourists who ridicule him in the steadfast belief he could n't possibly understand their language -LRB- he can -RRB- , or the jerks at the office who sit around talking shit . When he 's randomly attacked on a walk back home from the store , it knocks something loose in him , and he finds himself taking whatever steps necessary to protect himself , be it by buying a gun or wandering into the karate dojo of `` Sensei '' -LRB- Alessandro Nivola -RRB- . Sensei 's straight-faced sophistry is exactly what a terrified , inadequate young man like Casey is searching for , and he quickly throws himself into the inner workings of the dojo to the exclusion of all his other responsibilities . Inevitably , Casey finds himself at Sensei 's mercy , manipulated into committing violence against a random bystander . He begins to witness firsthand the abuse Sensei levels at his own students , the tactics he uses to build their self-esteem through group violence , but never high enough that they are n't in awe of him . That includes Imogen Poots ' super serious , murderously intense Anna , one of the dojo 's founders who nonetheless is passed over for promotion time and again . She 's useful for teaching the children 's morning classes , though , because of course a woman has stronger maternal instincts -- it ca n't be helped . The world of The Art of Self-Defense is an immaculately contained space , as claustrophobic and unmoored as modern life , filmed almost exclusively in cramped interiors and dingy rooms with sickly lighting . Something feels off about Sensei and his dojo right from the get-go , and as more layers of his deception and manipulation are peeled back , it all paints a perfect portrait of a social order based on hateful , dangerous bullshit , but one so alluring that you completely believe the prisoners within it really would never think to leave . Though the film veers heedlessly into the truly Grand Guignol , the parody of toxic masculinity only feels exaggerated by a very little bit . The Art of Self-Defense does n't argue for compassion and acknowledgment of one 's softer side so much as it argues you should fight against toxic bullshit . Preferably with a well-timed sucker punch . -- Kenneth Lowe / Full Review 21 . The Peanut Butter Falcon Year : 2019 Directors : Tyler Nilson , Mike Schwartz In The Peanut Butter Falcon , Shia LaBeouf plays Tyler , a North Carolina fisherman wrestling with grief and guilt : His brother , Mark -LRB- John Bernthal -RRB- , died in a car accident . Worse , he 's beefing with competing fishermen Duncan -LRB- John Hawkes -RRB- and Ratboy -LRB- Yelawolf -RRB- , who beat him down in the dirt over a matter of stolen crab traps . Tyler retaliates by burning their gear and taking a powder , where he runs into Zak -LRB- Zack Gottsagen -RRB- , a young man with Down syndrome fleeing from the retirement home where he 's kept , who dreams of becoming a professional wrestler . Tyler , disgruntled at first by his new company , takes a shine to Zak and adopts him as a surrogate brother . Beneath his scratchy beard , ragged clothing , and grime-streaked exterior , Tyler 's a good man , better than good , even . He respects Zak 's humanity to an extent that his custodian , Eleanor -LRB- Dakota Johnson -RRB- , does n't : Where she sees a child in need of constant care and supervision , he sees a grown man with agency enough to make decisions about how he should live his life . But Tyler 's goodness is kept hemmed in by the threat of prototypical macho violence . Duncan and Ratboy are his opposites , brutes who solve problems at the business end of fists and tire irons . It 's little wonder that Tyler goes on the lam . He 's escaping from violence , of course , but he 's also trying to get away from the Mark-sized hole in his life , representing his only source of empathy and warmth before tragedy snatched it from him . Without that , he 's spiritually and financially destitute . He 's able to overcome the former by bonding with Zak . It 's through their companionship , and Zak 's immense capacity for compassion , that Tyler is redeemed , if not spared . -- Andy Crump 20 . The Art of Racing in the Rain Year : 2019 Director : Simon Curtis Based on its narrative beats , a strictly superficial reading of The Art of Racing in the Rain could easily frame it as nothing but a shameless melodrama with the sole mission of jerking many a tear from its audience through an endless pounding of manufactured tragedy for its protagonist . -LRB- From that perspective , the casting of Milo Ventimiglia from This Is Us seems like supporting evidence . -RRB- As Denny , an exceptional racecar driver who 's hit with one heartbreaking and instantly relatable conflict after another , he spends a decade struggling to raise a family and pursue his career against seemingly insurmountable odds . Yet The Art of Racing in the Rain manages to rise above the genre 's confines through three genuine and refreshing additions while serving as a reminder that there 's nothing wrong with melodrama in and of itself . The first intriguing angle is the story 's most gimmicky one -- Denny 's story is told entirely through the point-of-view of his loyal Golden Retriever , Enzo , named after Ferrari and voiced with gruff , heartwarming conviction by Kevin Costner . The second is its approach to spirituality . Without diving into the dogma of any specific religion , there 's a profoundly warm and earnest understanding of death as transition and not the end . Finally , as the title suggests , this is a film relying heavily on racecar driving as a metaphor for navigating life with grace and determination , especially during times of exceptional hardship . Enzo , like his owner , is a huge nerd when it comes to racing , so he studies alongside Denny its most intricate details . Enzo 's existential metaphors related to racing are a slight step above workplace inspirational posters , but that 's kind of the point , to revel in the objective simplicity that life 's most complex problems sometimes needs . With layered direction that emphasizes quiet moments over outward emotion during scenes of tragedy , and soulful performances all around , The Art of Racing in the Rain is just the right kind of tearjerker with an injection of positivity that our understandably pessimistic society needs . -- Oktay Ege Kozak / Full Review 19 . Aladdin Year : 2019 Director : Guy Ritchie I have n't really been a fan of Disney 's live-action remakes , but Aladdin is a rip-roaring action/fantasy/musical that manages to exist on a relatively independent and distinguished tonal field . The basic story beats and the songs are of course transplanted , but at least an effort is put forth to serve a wholly invigorating piece of family entertainment that provides something new to fans and newcomers alike . True to its ambition of presenting an epic adventure , this Aladdin runs a whopping forty minutes longer than the 1992 version , yet almost none of it is filler . Princess Jasmine -LRB- Naomi Scott -RRB- is given as much agency and focus as the titular character -LRB- Mena Massoud -RRB- , the beloved street rat who falls in love with her and decides to use a certain magic lamp with a certain resident genie -LRB- Will Smith -RRB- to become a prince so he can marry her . Of course , the palace 's evil vizier Jafar -LRB- Marwan Kenzari -RRB- is also after the lamp . Will Jafar snatch the lamp from Aladdin and become the bloodthirsty tyrant of the land , or will Aladdin defeat him with the help of his buddies , the twitchy monkey Abu and the kindly magic carpet ? Of course the answer is clear for anyone with a passing knowledge of the animated film . But some changes , even tiny ones , give us new perspectives on the story . As a Middle-Eastern immigrant myself , I 'd be lying if I said the sight of such characters being portrayed by actors who match their ethnicity in such a giant budget Hollywood blockbuster did n't make me feel a sense of due progress . Yet of course all of that is for naught if the talent ca n't deliver . Which brings us to Smith 's genie . It 's impossible to top the 100-jokes-a-minute singular power and vigor of Robin Williams ' voice performance , so Smith does n't even try . He wisely stays in his lane by letting his trademark swagger and cool magnetism inform the character . With music that breathes new life to beloved songs with an emphasis on percussion and horns , and production designer Gemma Jackson 's luscious world building that borrows from various Middle-Eastern cultures as added pedigree , Aladdin is the rare remake that actually gives us a whole new world . -- Oktay Ege Kozak / Full Review 18 . Judy Year : 2019 Director : Rupert Goold The standard `` Somewhere Over the Rainbow '' takes on a powerful new meaning in Judy , the latest drama from director Rupert Goold and writer Tom Edge . In the biopic , aging legend Judy Garland -LRB- Ren\u00e9e Zellweger -RRB- runs across New York , and eventually across the globe , to keep working . Based on the play End of the Rainbow by Peter Quilter , Judy works as a subdued rehashing of some of Garland 's most scandalous moments . Flashing back and forth between the alcoholic final haze of Garland 's career and the pill-popping days of her youth , Garland 's darkest and loneliest days frame her existence . Frequently bordering on melodrama , Zellweger centers the film on the individual , not the celebrity . In her best performance since Chicago , she disappears into the icon . Her usual on-screen traits -- the curled lips , stamping feet and balled-up fist -- are replaced with a justified rage that she wields like a whip . Every insult slung lands precisely and without mercy , though she gets as good as she gives . When faced with the crackling loathing of ex-husband Sidney Luft -LRB- Rufus Sewell -RRB- , she swells like a pufferfish at the indignation that she was ever anything less than a wonderful mother . But , when she asks her daughter if moving to her father 's would make her happy and her daughter replies yes , she caves in on herself at the perceived loss of the last person who made her feel needed and loved . The Garland-obsessed fan wo n't learn a lot from watching this biopic , but education does n't appear to be the main goal of the filmmakers . The impact of the once golden girl on her family and her fans carries the most emotional punch . In the case of the latter , especially , Judy does a spectacular job highlighting Garland 's connection to the gay community . In the hands of Goold , Edge and Zellweger , the story blossoms into a heartbreaking journey of one abused soul reaching out to , and rejecting , nearly everyone that will have her . -- Joelle Monique / Full Review 17 . Spider-Man : Far From Home Year : 2019 Director : Jon Watts Coming on the heels of the hefty hunk o ' cinematic event that was Avengers : Endgame , Spider-Man : Far from Home is , as one would expect , much lighter fare . That does n't stop this 23rd and final entry in the MCU 's initial Feige Phase barrage from serving as an effective coda for Endgame even as it presents what is , in many ways , a classic Spider-Man adventure . Along with having a Grade A capturing of a C-tier villain -LRB- Mysterio -RRB- , Spider-Man : Far from Home is -LRB- relatively -RRB- small , sincere and funny , and has more than your usual MCU allotment of post-credit bombshells . Though a comparatively recent addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe , this is already Tom Holland 's fifth film as Spider-Man in three years . Like so many other casting decisions made in the MCU , he 's proven himself near perfect in the role . No Golden Age lasts forever , and the MCU will eventually stumble -- but as long as they can spin box office -LRB- and audience -RRB- gold from relatively the Mysterios and Vultures of Spidey 's rogues gallery , it wo n't be Holland 's Spider-Man that is the first to stumble . -- Michael Burgin / Full Review 16 . Rocketman Year : 2019 Director : Dexter Fletcher Any major studio that gets its hands on the rights to a rock star 's music , desiring to retrofit it into a movie for the fans , has two options : Make a biopic that episodically lines up snippets of the artist 's life , like last year 's bafflingly popular Bohemian Rhapsody , or make a jukebox musical that integrates the beloved hits into an original story , like the gaudy Mamma Mia ! or the sublime Across the Universe . Rocketman , a dazzlingly entertaining , heartbreaking , vulnerable , and delightfully exuberant biopic about the great Elton John -LRB- Taron Egerton -RRB- dares to ask a question so simple yet so smart : Why not do both ? So we get an intimately dissected and well-acted biopic as well as a spectacularly visualized and choreographed musical . We begin with Elton , n\u00e9 Reginald , a child prodigy burying himself in his music to cope with the emotional hole in his heart brought on by his loveless father -LRB- Steven Mackintosh -RRB- and selfish mother -LRB- Bryce Dallas Howard -RRB- . After finding true inspiration thanks to his lyric-writing partner Bernie Taupin -LRB- Jamie Bell -RRB- , he enjoys the spoils of becoming an overnight smash . But of course the music , the money and the millions of fans turn out to be a temporary fix for the loneliness he has felt since childhood , so in comes the `` dark period '' full of drugs , sex , copious partying and the alienation of everyone who genuinely loves him , a period made worse by an abusive relationship with his life partner/manager -LRB- Richard Madden -RRB- . This all sets up the third act , the long road to redemption . So the recipe is the same we 've tried many times before , but writer Lee Hall and director Dexter Fletcher infuse it with delectable and previously unused ingredients . In a strictly audio/visual sense , the musical numbers are stunning , each new one managing to top what came before in uniqueness and whimsy . Most importantly , Taron Egerton embodies Elton with a captivating natural presence ; his is a meticulously mannered performance in the best possible way , where even the tiniest facial tic becomes an irreplaceable detail that completes the big picture . Overall , it 's hard to imagine a better tribute to such a singular icon . -- Oktay Ege Kozak / Full Review", "url": "https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2020/01/the-best-movies-on-redbox.html", "kws": ["Redbox", "Movies", "blockbuster^^movies", "modern^^Marvel^^movies", "films", "kids^^movies", "theaters", "superhero^^films", "Blu-Ray", "Netflix", "horror^^hits", "'80s^^horror^^comedy", "film", "comedies", "Disney", "HBO", "Hulu", "indie", "Showtime", "Captain^^Marvel^^Year"], "text_category": {"first_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment": 1.0000079870224}, "second_cat": {"ArtsEntertainment_Movies": 1.0000079870224}}}
